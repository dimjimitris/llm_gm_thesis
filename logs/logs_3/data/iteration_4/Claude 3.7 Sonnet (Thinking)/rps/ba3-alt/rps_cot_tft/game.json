Additionally, many players tend to choose rock as their first move in RPS games\n7.

First, let me understand the payoff structure. It's not symmetric:\n   - Rock is high-risk, high-reward (\u00b13 points)\n   - Paper and scissors are lower-risk, lower-reward (\u00b11 point)\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their strategy or patterns yet. I need to make a first move based on game theory principles.\n\n3. In traditional rock-paper-scissors, the Nash equilibrium is to play each option with equal probability (1/3). However, with these asymmetric payoffs, that might not be optimal.\n\n4. The risk/reward structure changes the expected value:\n   - Rock: If I win (against scissors), I get +1. If I lose (against paper), I get -3. If tie, I get 0.\n   - Paper: If I win (against rock), I get +3. If I lose (against scissors), I get -1. If tie, I get 0.\n   - Scissors: If I win (against paper), I get +1. If I lose (against rock), I get -1. If tie, I get 0.\n\n5. Let me calculate expected value if the opponent plays randomly (1/3 probability for each move):\n   - Rock: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = 1/3 - 1 = -2/3\n   - Paper: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 1 - 1/3 = +2/3\n   - Scissors: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/3 - 1/3 = 0\n\n6. Based on this calculation, Paper has the highest expected value against a random player.\n\n7. Another consideration: many people tend to play Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors (this is a common observation in RPS psychology). If my opponent is likely to play Rock first, then Paper would be the best counter.\n\n8. Given these considerations, I'll choose Paper as my move for the first round.

Let me consider what this means:\n1. They might be following a different pattern than I thought\n2. They might have been trying to break the pattern themselves\n3. They might have anticipated that I'd break the pattern with scissors\n\nNow I need to predict what they'll play next:\n- If they're trying to win against my last move (scissors), they'll play rock again\n- If they're following a standard rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors progression from their last move (rock), they'll play paper\n- If they think I'll anticipate their paper and play scissors, they might play rock again\n\nGiven that they played rock last time and won against my scissors, there's a decent chance they'll stick with rock as it was successful. People often repeat successful moves.\n\nBut the standard progression would be for them to play paper after rock.\n\nLooking at the payoff structure:\n- If I play rock and they play rock: tie (0 points)\n- If I play rock and they play paper: I lose (-3 points)\n- If I play rock and they play scissors: I win (+3 points)\n- If I play paper and they play rock: I win (+1 point)\n- If I play paper and they play paper: tie (0 points)\n- If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose (-1 point)\n- If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose (-1 point)\n- If I play scissors and they play paper: I win (+1 point)\n- If I play scissors and they play scissors: tie (0 points)\n\nI think paper is a good move here. If they repeat their rock play (which was successful), I win. If they follow the standard progression to paper, we tie. If they try to anticipate scissors from me and play rock, I still win.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
