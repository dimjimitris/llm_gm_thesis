    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Calculating expected value of each move (assuming random opponent play):\n   - Paper: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n   - Rock: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = +2/3 points\n   - Scissors: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n4. Rock has the highest expected value in this modified game due to the high payoff when rock beats paper.\n5. Since this is the first move against a new opponent with no established pattern, I'll choose the option with highest expected value.\n\n[move] rock"

After losing with rock, and based on their earlier patterns, they might switch to paper.\n\n5. If they play paper, rock would be my best move (+3 points).\n\n6. If they play scissors again, rock would lose (-1 points), but that's a smaller penalty compared to other potential losses.\n\n7. If they play rock again, rock would tie (0 points).\n\n8. The risk-reward ratio favors rock in this situation.\n\n[move] rock"

Critical change: They've switched to rock after a long period of favoring scissors.\n\n4. This appears to be a strategic adaptation - they recognized I was countering their scissors with paper and deliberately switched to rock.\n\n5. After such a significant win (-3 for me), they're likely to stick with rock for at least another round.\n\n6. If they continue with rock, scissors would be my best counter (+1 points).\n\n[move] scissors"

Looking at what they do after ties, especially rock-rock ties:\n   - After Round 1 tie (rock-rock), they played paper\n   - After Round 4 tie (rock-rock), they played scissors\n   - After Round 9 tie (scissors-scissors), they played scissors\n   - After Round 14 tie (paper-paper), they played scissors\n   - After Round 17 tie (scissors-scissors), they played scissors\n   - After Round 19 tie (paper-paper), they played scissors\n\n4. They've played scissors after ties 4/6 times, particularly in later rounds.\n\n5. If they follow their most common pattern after ties, they'll likely play scissors next.\n\n6.
