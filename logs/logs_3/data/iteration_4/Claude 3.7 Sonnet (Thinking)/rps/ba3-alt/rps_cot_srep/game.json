Calculating expected value of each move (assuming random opponent play):\n   - Paper: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n   - Rock: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = +2/3 points\n   - Scissors: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n4.

I notice they've returned to scissors after my incorrect prediction that they'd play paper.\n\n4. They've won with scissors against my rock, and their most frequent move throughout the game has been scissors (6/13 rounds).\n\n5. After winning with a move, they've often repeated it in the next round.\n\n6. If they stick with scissors (likely based on their pattern), paper would win (+1).\n\n[move] paper"

Rock beating paper gives a higher reward (+3) than paper beating scissors (+1) or scissors beating rock (+1).\n\nIn a single game against a fresh player with no prior history, there's no pattern to exploit. However, given the asymmetric payoffs, we need to consider expected value:\n\nExpected value for paper (assuming opponent plays randomly): \n(0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3\n\nExpected value for rock (assuming opponent plays randomly):\n(3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3\n\nExpected value for scissors (assuming opponent plays randomly):\n(-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on expected value, rock appears to be the best opening move as it has the highest expected payoff if the opponent plays randomly. However, a strategic opponent might anticipate this and play paper to counter.\n\nSince I don't have information about the opponent yet and this is the first move, I'll go with the move that has the highest expected value: rock.",

After losing with scissors against my paper, they played scissors again. This suggests they might be using a very simple strategy or are committed to scissors regardless of outcome.\n\nGiven their strong preference for scissors, paper continues to be my best counter (+1 points). Even though I've now won twice in a row with paper against their scissors, their pattern suggests they're likely to play scissors again.\n\nIf they do finally switch, they would most likely play rock to counter my paper. But given their history, I think there's a higher probability they'll stick with scissors again.",

I lost (-1 points)\n- Round 23: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points)\n\nThe opponent's sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\nTheir pattern is becoming harder to predict. They've gone from rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock in the last three rounds.\n\nLooking at what they do after ties:\n- After Round 1 tie (rock-rock), they played paper\n- After Round 4 tie (rock-rock), they played scissors\n- After Round 9 tie (scissors-scissors), they played scissors\n- After Round 14 tie (paper-paper), they played scissors\n- After Round 17 tie (scissors-scissors), they played scissors\n- After Round 19 tie (paper-paper), they played scissors\n\nAfter ties, they've played scissors 4/6 times, especially in later rounds. Now we have another rock-rock tie.\n\nIf they follow their most common pattern after ties, they'll play scissors next.\n\nIf they play scissors, paper would win (+1).\nIf they play paper, rock would win (+3).\nIf they play rock again, we'd tie (0).\n\nPaper offers a good chance of winning (+1) if they follow their pattern after ties and play scissors.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
