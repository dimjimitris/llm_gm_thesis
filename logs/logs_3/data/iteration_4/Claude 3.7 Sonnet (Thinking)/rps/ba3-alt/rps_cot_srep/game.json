Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n4. Ties result in 0 points for both players\n\nThis is an interesting variant of rock-paper-scissors with asymmetric payoffs. Let's think about the strategic implications:\n\nRock seems to have the highest potential payoff (+3 if it wins against paper), but also the highest potential loss (-3 if it loses to paper).\nPaper and scissors have lower stakes (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I need to think about what might be a good opening move.\n\nTraditional rock-paper-scissors strategy often suggests choosing rock first because many players instinctively choose rock as their first move. However, in this variant, the payoffs are different.\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- If opponent chooses rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent chooses paper: -3 points (loss)\n- If opponent chooses scissors: +1 point (win)\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- If opponent chooses rock: +3 points (win)\n- If opponent chooses paper: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent chooses scissors: -1 point (loss)\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- If opponent chooses rock: -1 point (loss)\n- If opponent chooses paper: +1 point (win)\n- If opponent chooses scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs, paper has the highest potential gain (+3) with a relatively small potential loss (-1). This makes paper seem like an attractive first move.\n\nHowever, if many players recognize this and choose paper, then scissors becomes a good counter. But if many players anticipate this and choose rock to counter scissors, then paper becomes good again.\n\nThis is the classic rock-paper-scissors cycle, but with the added complexity of asymmetric payoffs.\n\nFor my first move, without any prior information about my opponent's strategy, I think paper is a reasonable choice. It has the highest potential gain and a relatively small potential loss.\n\nLet me make my move:",

Now I need to decide on my next move.\n\nLet's think through this strategically:\n\n1. My opponent chose paper in the first round. What might they do next?\n   - They might assume I'll switch to scissors (to beat their paper)\n   - They might stay with paper if they think I'll stay with paper\n   - They might switch to rock to try something new\n\n2. Given that psychology, here are my options:\n   - Rock: Would lose to paper (-3 points), but beat scissors (+1 points)\n   - Paper: Would tie with paper (0 points), lose to scissors (-1 points), beat rock (+3 points)\n   - Scissors: Would beat paper (+1 points), lose to rock (-1 points)\n\n3. It's common in these games for players to shift strategies after a tie. Many players would reason that I might switch to scissors to beat their paper, so they might switch to rock to counter my predicted scissors.\n\n4. If they do switch to rock, then I should use paper to get +3 points.\n   If they stay with paper, scissors would get me +1 points.\n   If they switch to scissors (least likely), rock would get me +1 points.\n\n5. Looking at the expected outcomes:\n   - If I choose rock and they choose paper (somewhat likely), I lose 3 points\n   - If I choose paper and they choose rock (somewhat likely), I gain 3 points\n   - If I choose scissors and they choose paper (somewhat likely), I gain 1 point\n\n6. Between paper and scissors, paper has a higher potential gain (+3) if my prediction about them switching to rock is correct. While scissors would beat their paper if they don't switch, the gain is only +1.\n\n7. Given these considerations, I think paper is again the best move. It has the highest potential payoff and covers the possibility that they'll switch to rock, which is psychologically plausible after a tie.",

Continue playing paper, expecting another tie\n2. Switch to scissors to try to beat my expected paper move\n3. Finally try playing rock\n\nGiven the unique game rules (paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock):\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- Wins against rock (+1)\n- Loses to paper (-1)\n\nIf I play rock:\n- Wins against paper (+3)\n- Loses to scissors (-1)\n\nIf I play paper:\n- Wins against scissors (+1)\n- Loses to rock (-3)\n\nSince they've played paper in the last two rounds, and they've never played rock before, rock would be my best move if they continue with paper. The risk is that they return to scissors (which they've heavily favored overall), in which case I would lose.\n\nGiven their recent back-to-back paper plays and the potential high reward (+3), I'll choose rock for this round.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1.

The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
