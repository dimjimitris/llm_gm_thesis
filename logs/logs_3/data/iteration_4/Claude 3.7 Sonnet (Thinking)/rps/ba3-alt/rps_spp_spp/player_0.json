    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me break down the expected values:\n- Rock: Wins against Paper (+3), Loses to Scissors (-1), Ties with Rock (0)\n- Paper: Wins against Scissors (+1), Loses to Rock (-3), Ties with Paper (0)\n- Scissors: Wins against Rock (+1), Loses to Paper (-1), Ties with Scissors (0)\n\nLooking at these payoffs, Rock has the highest potential gain but also high risk.\n\nStrategic Planner: For the first move against a fresh opponent, we should consider what most players typically choose first. In traditional RPS, many beginners tend to choose Rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: That's correct. Studies show Rock is often the first choice of novice players. However, this is a modified game with different payoffs, and the opponent might be aware of that psychological tendency.\n\nData Analyst: If we assume equal probability of the opponent choosing any move, the expected values would be:\n- Rock: (+3-1+0)/3 = +0.67\n- Paper: (+1-3+0)/3 = -0.67\n- Scissors: (+1-1+0)/3 = 0\n\nGame Theorist: Based on expected value alone, Rock appears to be the optimal first move against a random player.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: But sophisticated players might anticipate Rock and counter with Scissors. Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we need to balance expected value with psychological tendencies.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the asymmetric nature of the game, I recommend starting with Rock for the first move. It has the highest expected value and can potentially set us up for a significant early lead.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

We played Rock and the opponent played Paper, which gave us 3 points according to the special rules of this game. This confirms our understanding that Rock beats Paper in this variant.\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent might adjust their strategy now. They could assume we'll play Rock again since it was successful, and counter with Scissors to beat our Rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: People often change their choice after losing. There's a high probability the opponent will switch to Rock or Scissors, with Rock being slightly more likely due to its perceived strength.\n\nData Analyst: Let's consider what the opponent might be thinking:\n1. They might expect us to play Rock again (since we won)\n2. They might play Scissors to counter our expected Rock\n3. They might play Rock themselves to match our previous successful move\n\nGame Theorist: If they play Scissors to counter our expected Rock, we should play Paper. Paper beats Scissors in this game, giving us 1 point.\n\nStrategic Planner: But if they play Rock (either expecting us to switch or mimicking our success), then our Paper would lose badly (-3 points).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The safest move with positive expected value appears to be Scissors. If they play Rock, we lose only 1 point. If they play Paper, we lose 1 point. If they play Scissors, it's a tie.\n\nGame Theorist: Let me calculate expected values if we assume equal probability of their next move:\n- Rock: (+3-1+0)/3 = +0.67\n- Paper: (+1-3+0)/3 = -0.67\n- Scissors: (-1-1+0)/3 = -0.67\n\nStrategic Planner: Based purely on math, Rock still has the highest expected value. However, considering psychology and the previous round, the opponent may be more likely to play Scissors to counter our Rock.\n\nData Analyst: I recommend Rock again. It has the highest expected value, and even if they try to counter with Scissors, we only lose 1 point, which is a manageable risk compared to the potential 3-point gain.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

There's a chance they might complete the cycle with Rock next, especially since they just won with Scissors.\n\nData Analyst: If they play Rock next and we're using the revised rule understanding, our best move would be Scissors, as it beats Rock (+1 point).\n\nGame Theorist: Let's calculate expected values with our updated understanding:\n- If we play Rock: Win vs Paper (+3), Lose vs Scissors (-1), Tie vs Rock (0)\n- If we play Paper: Win vs Scissors (+1), Lose vs Rock (-3), Tie vs Paper (0)\n- If we play Scissors: Win vs Rock (+1), Lose vs Paper (-1), Tie vs Scissors (0)\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent may be testing different moves to understand our strategy.

The fact that they've played Scissors so many times (4/8 rounds) suggests it's a move they're comfortable with.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play Rock next (following their original sequence), our optimal move would be Scissors (+1 point).\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's examine the consequences of each move:\n- If we play Scissors and they play Rock: We win (+1)\n- If we play Scissors and they play Paper: We lose (-1)\n- If we play Scissors and they play Scissors: Tie (0)\n\nData Analyst: Given their strong tendency to play Scissors in even rounds and Rock following Paper \u2192 Scissors in their original sequence, Rock seems most likely for round 9.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

For this opponent, that would be Rock in odd-numbered rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Their last two moves were Rock \u2192 Scissors. Historically, they rarely play Scissors twice in a row, which further supports the likelihood of them playing Rock or Paper next.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their strong historical tendency to play Rock in odd rounds, and the fact they just played Scissors, Rock seems most likely for round 21.\n\nData Analyst: If they play Rock, our best counter is Scissors (+1 point).
