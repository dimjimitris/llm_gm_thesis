Let me re-read them:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\nActually, this doesn't match the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules. In traditional RPS:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut in this variant:\n- Paper beats scissors (reverse of traditional)\n- Rock beats paper (same as traditional)\n- Scissors beats rock (reverse of traditional)\n\nSo the cyclic relationship is broken. Let me analyze the optimal strategy:\n\nIf I play rock:\n- If opponent plays rock: tie (0 points)\n- If opponent plays paper: lose 3 points\n- If opponent plays scissors: lose 1 point\n\nIf I play paper:\n- If opponent plays rock: win 3 points\n- If opponent plays paper: tie (0 points)\n- If opponent plays scissors: win 1 point\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- If opponent plays rock: win 1 point\n- If opponent plays paper: lose 1 point\n- If opponent plays scissors: tie (0 points)\n\nLooking at the expected value for a uniform random opponent:\n- Rock: (0 - 3 - 1)/3 = -4/3\n- Paper: (3 + 0 + 1)/3 = 4/3\n- Scissors: (1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nWait, I think I still misunderstood the rules. Let me re-read them carefully:\n\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo the relationship is:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis is actually the reverse of traditional RPS. \n\nLet me recalculate the expected values:\n\nIf I play rock:\n- If opponent plays rock: tie (0 points)\n- If opponent plays paper: lose 3 points\n- If opponent plays scissors: win 1 point\n\nIf I play paper:\n- If opponent plays rock: win 3 points\n- If opponent plays paper: tie (0 points)\n- If opponent plays scissors: lose 1 point\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- If opponent plays rock: lose 1 point\n- If opponent plays paper: win 1 point\n- If opponent plays scissors: tie (0 points)\n\nExpected value against a uniform random opponent:\n- Rock: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3\n- Paper: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = 2/3\n- Scissors: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on this analysis, Paper has the highest expected value against a random opponent.\n\nI'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which suggests they don't have any history or established pattern. In this case, playing the move with the highest expected value (Paper) seems to be the best strategy.\n\nSo my move will be Paper.",

Let's think about my strategy for this round.\n\nThe payoff structure is:\n- paper beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- rock beats paper: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n- scissors beats rock: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\nGiven that my opponent chose paper in the previous round, they might:\n1. Stick with paper again (expecting me to switch)\n2. Switch to rock (anticipating I might choose scissors)\n3. Switch to scissors (anticipating I might choose paper again)\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- Against paper: Tie (0 points)\n- Against rock: Loss (-3 points)\n- Against scissors: Win (+1 point)\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- Against paper: Win (+3 points)\n- Against rock: Tie (0 points)\n- Against scissors: Loss (-1 point)\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- Against paper: Loss (-1 point)\n- Against rock: Win (+1 point)\n- Against scissors: Tie (0 points)\n\nSince my opponent chose paper last round and we tied, they might expect me to switch to scissors to try to beat their paper. If they anticipate this, they might switch to rock to counter scissors.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose paper, which would lose to rock but at least protect against scissors.\n\nActually, I think I need to reconsider. If they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors. If they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. If they think I'll choose rock, they might choose paper.\n\nThis is becoming cyclical, which is typical for rock-paper-scissors games. In such situations, mixing up strategies can be effective.\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs (rock beating paper gives more points than other wins), choosing rock seems to have the highest potential upside.\n\nLet me go with rock this round.",

In the first 6 rounds, the opponent mirrored my moves exactly. Then suddenly after that, I started winning consistently with very few exceptions. It almost seems like the opponent is deliberately letting me win after the initial mirroring phase.\n\nThe wins are also inconsistent with the game rules as described:\n- Paper beats scissors: This is wrong according to the rules. Scissors should beat paper.\n- Rock beats paper: According to rules, paper should beat rock.\n- Scissors beats rock: According to rules, rock should beat scissors.\n\nEither there's a misunderstanding in how the results are being reported, or the rules are being applied incorrectly. Let me double check the rules from the initial description:\n\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point\n\nWait, I think I was confused about the rules. Let me clarify:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nActually, I need to be careful here. Let me re-read the rules once more:\n\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point: This means if I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point\n- Rock beats paper giving winner 3 points: This means if I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win 3 points\n- Scissors beats rock giving winner 1 point: This means if I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win 1 point\n\nSo the actual dominance is:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis is rock-paper-scissors but with the typical cycle inverted and asymmetric scoring.\n\nGiven that understanding, let me analyze my previous rounds again:\n\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played paper - this should mean I lose, but it says I won\nRound 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors - this means opponent wins (scissors beats rock)\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors - this should mean I lose, but it says I won\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock - this should mean I lose, but it says I won\n\nI'm still seeing inconsistencies. Let me just double-check the exact wording one more time:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\"- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\n\"- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOh! I think I see the problem. The rules are reversed from traditional rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper)\n- Rock beats paper (same as traditional)\n- Scissors beats rock (not rock beats scissors)\n\nLet me check my rounds again:\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played paper - by the rules, I should win (rock beats paper)\nRound 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors - by the rules, opponent should win (scissors beats rock)\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors - by the rules, I should win (paper beats scissors)\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock - by the rules, I should win (scissors beats rock)\n\nOk, now it makes sense. For this next round, since I've been winning consistently, I'll stick with scissors since it's been working well.",

Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n\nThere's a strange pattern here. For the first 6 rounds, the opponent copied my moves exactly. But then suddenly in rounds 7 onward, I started winning most rounds. Even more strange, the game states I'm winning but the opponent's moves don't make sense given the rules:\n\n- Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper - paper should beat rock, so I should have lost\n- Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors - scissors should beat paper, so I should have lost\n- Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock - rock should beat scissors, so I should have lost\n\nBut the game says I won these rounds. This suggests either:\n1. There was a mistake in the game description\n2. The scoring/win determination is inverted from what was explained\n3. There's some confusion in how the results are being reported\n\nLet me review the rules again:\n- paper beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- rock beats paper: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n- scissors beats rock: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\nLooking at the rules and the outcomes reported, I think there might be a discrepancy. The rules as stated don't match the outcomes being reported. For example, if rock beats paper (giving +3 to the rock player), then in round 7 where I played rock and opponent played paper, I should have won +3 points (which matches), but the description says I won with rock against paper, when according to the initial rules paper should beat rock.\n\nActually, I think I misunderstood the rules initially. Let me reinterpret:\n- When it says \"paper beats scissors\", it means if you play paper and opponent plays scissors, you win\n- When it says \"rock beats paper\", it means if you play rock and opponent plays paper, you win\n- When it says \"scissors beats rock\", it means if you play scissors and opponent plays rock, you win\n\nThis interpretation matches the outcomes I'm seeing.

To win against rock, I should play scissors, which would give me +1 point.\n\nLet me double check if there's really a pattern.

Let me look at it differently.\n\nActually, let's think about what's been happening more broadly:\n- When I play rock, I've been winning +3 points multiple times\n- When I play scissors, I've been winning +1 points multiple times\n- When I play paper, I've been winning +1 points multiple times\n\nWait a minute - the payoff structure is:\n- paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n- scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\nBut I've been winning with rock against paper (+3), paper against scissors (+1), and scissors against rock (+1). This doesn't make sense based on the rules we were given, unless the opponent is consistently playing the move that I win against.\n\nLet me re-check the rules against what's happening...\n\nActually, I think there's confusion in the game description or reporting. According to the rules:\n- paper beats rock (not scissors)\n- rock beats scissors (not paper)\n- scissors beats paper (not rock)\n\nBut the reports are saying:\n- Round 13: I chose rock, opponent chose paper, I won +3\n- Round 14: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors, I won +1\n- Round 15: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock, I won +1\n\nThese outcomes are opposite to the rules we were given.\n\nEither way, the pattern seems to be that I'm winning regardless of what I play.
