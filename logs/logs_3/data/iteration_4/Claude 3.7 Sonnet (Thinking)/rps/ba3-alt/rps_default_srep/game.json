The typical Rock-Paper-Scissors rules are:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n- Paper beats Rock\n\nBut here it seems the relationships are reversed? Let me analyze what happened in our game:\nI played paper, opponent played scissors, and I won. This would match the rule \"paper beats scissors\" as stated.\n\nFor this next round, I'll try to play according to these stated rules, even though they're different from the traditional game. Since I won with paper against scissors, I might try paper again, or maybe try rock which seems to beat paper and gives more points.\n\nLet me go with rock this time, which according to the stated rules would beat paper (giving 3 points if I win).",

It says:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nIf paper beats scissors, then paper is the winner and scissors is the loser. Paper gets 1 point, scissors gets -1.\nSimilarly, rock beats paper (rock gets 3, paper gets -3), and scissors beats rock (scissors gets 1, rock gets -1).\n\nThis is different from the traditional Rock Paper Scissors game.

I think I just got momentarily confused.
