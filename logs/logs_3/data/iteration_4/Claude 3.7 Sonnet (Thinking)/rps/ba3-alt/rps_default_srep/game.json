      "reasoning_text": "Let's analyze this game. It's a variant of rock-paper-scissors with asymmetric payoffs:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Tie: no points\n\nWait, there seems to be an issue with the description. The traditional rock-paper-scissors has:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut the description says:\n- Paper beats scissors (this is reversed from the traditional game)\n- Rock beats paper (this matches the traditional game)\n- Scissors beats rock (this is reversed from the traditional game)\n\nSo the cycle is different from the traditional game. Let me make sure I understand the winning relationships:\n\nPaper > Scissors > Rock > Paper\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Let me double check...\n\nOh, I think I misread. Let me parse the game rules again:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nSo the winning relationships are:\nPaper > Scissors\nRock > Paper\nScissors > Rock\n\nThis creates a cycle as in the traditional game. But the payoffs are different:\n- Winning with paper or scissors: +1\n- Winning with rock: +3\n- Losing to paper or scissors: -1\n- Losing to rock: -3\n\nSo rock is a high-risk, high-reward move. If I win with rock, I get +3, but if I lose against scissors, I lose -1.\n\nGiven these payoffs, what's the best strategy? Let's think about the expected value of each move against a random opponent:\n\nFor Paper:\n- If opponent plays Paper: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays Rock: -3 points (I lose)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: +1 points (I win)\nAssuming equal probabilities (1/3 each): (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3\n\nFor Rock:\n- If opponent plays Paper: +3 points (I win)  \n- If opponent plays Rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: -1 points (I lose)\nAssuming equal probabilities: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = 2/3\n\nFor Scissors:\n- If opponent plays Paper: -1 points (I lose)\n- If opponent plays Rock: +1 points (I win)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: 0 points (tie)\nAssuming equal probabilities: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nWait, I think I got confused again. Let me re-read the rules one more time:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\nSo the winning relationships are:\nPaper > Scissors\nRock > Paper\nScissors > Rock\n\nHmm, this still seems backwards from traditional rock-paper-scissors. Let me double check...\n\nOh wait, I think I misread the rules. Let me try again:\n\n- Paper beats rock (as in traditional RPS)\n- Rock beats scissors (as in traditional RPS)\n- Scissors beats paper (as in traditional RPS)\n\nAnd the payoffs are:\n- Paper beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n- Rock beats scissors: winner +3, loser -3\n- Scissors beats paper: winner +1, loser -1\n\nThat makes more sense. Let me recalculate the expected values:\n\nFor Paper:\n- If opponent plays Paper: 0 (tie)\n- If opponent plays Rock: +1 (I win)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: -1 (I lose)\nAssuming equal probabilities: (0 + 1 - 1)/3 = 0\n\nFor Rock:\n- If opponent plays Paper: -1 (I lose)\n- If opponent plays Rock: 0 (tie)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: +3 (I win)\nAssuming equal probabilities: (-1 + 0 + 3)/3 = 2/3\n\nFor Scissors:\n- If opponent plays Paper: +1 (I win)\n- If opponent plays Rock: -3 (I lose)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: 0 (tie)\nAssuming equal probabilities: (1 - 3 + 0)/3 = -2/3\n\nActually, no, let's be even more careful. Here's what the hint says verbatim:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo the winning relationships are:\nPaper > Scissors\nRock > Paper\nScissors > Rock\n\nThis is indeed different from the traditional game. Let me calculate the expected values one more time:\n\nFor Paper:\n- If opponent plays Paper: 0 (tie)\n- If opponent plays Rock: -3 (I lose)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: +1 (I win)\nAssuming equal probabilities: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3\n\nFor Rock:\n- If opponent plays Paper: +3 (I win)\n- If opponent plays Rock: 0 (tie)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: -1 (I lose)\nAssuming equal probabilities: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = 2/3\n\nFor Scissors:\n- If opponent plays Paper: -1 (I lose)\n- If opponent plays Rock: +1 (I win)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: 0 (tie)\nAssuming equal probabilities: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on these calculations, Rock has the highest expected value against a random opponent. However, this assumes the opponent plays randomly. If they're strategic, they might anticipate this and play scissors more often.\n\nSince this is the first round and I don't have any information about the opponent yet, I'll start with Rock, which has the highest expected value against a random opponent.",

According to the game description:\n\n- Paper beats rock (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nSo if I played rock and my opponent played paper, then I should have lost the round and gotten -3 points (since rock loses to paper, and the penalty for losing when playing rock is -3 points).\n\nBut the hint says I won and scored 3 points. This is confusing because it contradicts the rules as stated. Let me double-check the rules again:\n\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n\nActually, reading more closely, the rules do say \"rock beats paper\" giving the winner 3 points. This is different from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules (where paper beats rock), but I'll go with the rules as stated in the game description.\n\nGiven these rules:\n- Rock beats paper\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis creates a cycle where each move beats one other move and loses to one other move.\n\nNow I need to make my next move. Since rock worked well last time (I won 3 points), I might be tempted to use it again. However, my opponent might anticipate this and choose scissors (which beats rock according to these rules). \n\nSo I'll change to paper this time. This would beat scissors if my opponent chooses that, and if they stick with paper, it would be a tie.",

Paper beats Rock, I should lose 1 point. But it says I won 3 points. Still doesn't match.\nRound 2: Paper vs Scissors. Scissors beats Paper, I should lose 1 point. But it says I won 1 point. Still doesn't match.\n\nThere seems to be confusion in how the results are being reported or interpreted. Let me try to infer the actual rules from the results:\n\nRound 1: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. I won 3 points. This suggests Rock beats Paper.\nRound 2: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors. I won 1 point. This suggests Paper beats Scissors.\nRound 11: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock. I won 1 point. This suggests Scissors beats Rock.\nRound 12: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. I lost 1 point. This suggests Scissors beats Rock.\n\nThis is still inconsistent. Let me double-check my understanding of the results.\n\nWait, I think I've been misinterpreting the results. Let me reread them:\n\nRound 1: \"You won the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper.\" This means I (rock) beat my opponent (paper), not that my opponent's move was better according to the rules.\n\nSo the actual progression has been:\n1. I: Rock, Opp: Paper - I won (Rock beats Paper)\n2. I: Paper, Opp: Scissors - I won (Paper beats Scissors)\n3. I: Scissors, Opp: Scissors - Tie\n4. I: Rock, Opp: Rock - Tie\n5. I: Paper, Opp: Paper - Tie\n6. I: Scissors, Opp: Scissors - Tie\n7. I: Rock, Opp: Rock - Tie\n8. I: Paper, Opp: Scissors - I won (Paper beats Scissors)\n9. I: Scissors, Opp: Scissors - Tie\n10. I: Rock, Opp: Rock - Tie\n11. I: Scissors, Opp: Rock - I won (Scissors beats Rock)\n12. I: Rock, Opp: Scissors - I lost (Scissors beats Rock)\n13. I: Paper, Opp: Scissors - I won (Paper beats Scissors)\n\nNow this makes more sense with the rules as stated:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nBut there's still a discrepancy. Let me look at the actual scores again:\n\nRound 1: Rock vs Paper - I won 3 points\nRound 2: Paper vs Scissors - I won 1 point\nRound 11: Scissors vs Rock - I won 1 point\nRound 12: Rock vs Scissors - I lost 1 point\nRound 13: Paper vs Scissors - I won 1 point\n\nThe scoring seems to be:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner 1 point\n- Rock beats paper: winner 3 points\n- Scissors beats rock: winner 1 point (and loser -1)\n\nHmm, given all this confusion, let me just choose a move without overthinking it. I'll play Rock this time.",

According to the rules, scissors beats paper, so I should have lost 1 point. But the feedback says I won 1 point.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding or the rules were presented differently than I initially understood. Let me re-read the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nActually, the feedback might be reversed. Let me re-interpret based on these rules:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper. Paper should beat rock, but the feedback says I won. This is inconsistent with the rules.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper should beat scissors according to the rules, so I won 1 point. This is consistent.\n\nI'm a bit confused about the actual rules being used. Let me proceed with the understanding that:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nSince my last move was scissors and I won, my opponent must have played rock. Let me try to find a pattern in their behavior.\n\nIt seems like my opponent might be mirroring my previous moves. For example, after I played scissors in round 3, they played scissors in round 4. After I played rock in round 4, they played rock in round 5, and so on.\n\nLet me try to use this pattern. If my opponent is mirroring my previous move, then they would play scissors next (since my last move was scissors). To beat scissors, I should play paper.\n\nHowever, there are also rounds where this pattern doesn't hold. Let me consider other strategies.\n\nWait, I think I've been misinterpreting the outcomes. The hint messages tell me the outcome and then explain what happened. Let me revisit:\n\nRound 1: \"You won the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper.\" This means I (rock) beat the opponent (paper).\nRound 2: \"You won the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors.\" This means I (paper) beat the opponent (scissors).\n\nSo it seems like the rules might be:\n- rock beats paper\n- paper beats scissors\n- scissors beats rock\n\nBut these rules are different from what was initially provided. Let me continue with caution.\n\nI'm going to choose Rock for the next move, as it has been successful for me in the past and might work well again.",

Opponent played scissors.\n14. I played rock, won 3 points. Opponent played paper.\n15. I played scissors, won 1 point. Opponent played rock.\n16. I played rock, won 3 points. Opponent played paper.\n\nI notice that there's been a lot of ties, which suggests that the opponent might be playing the same move I'm playing. However, there are also instances where I'm winning significantly.\n\nI've won 8 rounds, tied 7 rounds, and lost 1 round.\n\nLet's look at what move the opponent is playing:\n- Opponent played paper: rounds 1, 14, 16 (I won with rock each time, scoring 3 points)\n- Opponent played scissors: rounds 2, 8, 13 (I won with paper each time, scoring 1 point)\n- Opponent played scissors: round 12 (I lost with rock, scoring -1 point)\n- Opponent played rock: rounds 11, 15 (I won with scissors each time, scoring 1 point)\n- Tie rounds: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 (Same move as me)\n\nI'm noticing that when I play rock, the opponent often plays paper, which would normally make me lose, but in this game, I'm winning 3 points. This is confusing because according to the rules:\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n\nWait, I think I may have misunderstood the outcome messages. Let me re-read them carefully.\n\nAh, I see. The messages are reporting MY move first, and THEN the opponent's move. So:\n\n1. I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost (-3 points).\n   Wait, the message said I won 3 points. This contradicts the rules.\n2. I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point).\n   But the message said I won 1 point. Again, this contradicts the rules.\n\nI think there might be a misinterpretation of the rules or the messages. Let me carefully look at the most recent outcome:\n\n\"You won the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored 3 points.\"\n\nAccording to the rules:\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n\nSo, if I played rock and my opponent played paper, and rock beats paper, then I would win 3 points. This is consistent with the outcome message.\n\nLet me re-check all the outcomes to ensure I understand correctly:\n\n1. I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points.\n2. I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point.\n3. I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie.\n4. I played rock, opponent played rock, tie.\n5. I played paper, opponent played paper, tie.\n6. I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie.\n7. I played rock, opponent played rock, tie.\n8. I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point.\n9. I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie.\n10. I played rock, opponent played rock, tie.\n11. I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point.\n12. I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point.\n13. I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point.\n14. I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points.\n15. I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point.\n16. I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points.\n\nWait, this still doesn't fully make sense according to the original rules. Let me carefully re-read the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n\nActually, I think the rule was meant to state that \"paper beats rock\" (not scissors), \"scissors beats paper\" and \"rock beats scissors\". Let me try to interpret the outcomes with this understanding:\n\n1. I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost (paper beats rock), but the message says I won 3 points. This is still confusing.\n\nMaybe I should interpret it a different way. Let's try again:\n\nThe rule \"paper beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\" means when paper is played against rock, paper gets 1 point and rock gets -1 point. Similarly, when rock is played against paper, rock gets 3 points and paper gets -3 points.\n\nSo, based on this interpretation:\n\n1. I played rock, opponent played paper, I got 3 points.\n2. I played paper, opponent played scissors, I got 1 point.\n\nBut this doesn't make sense either based on the rules.\n\nLet me think step by step. It seems like there might be a discrepancy between the rules and the actual game mechanics. Let's focus on the patterns and try to come up with a move.\n\nGiven the fact that I've won most of the rounds, and the success with different moves, I think a balanced strategy is advisable. Since I've had success with rock recently (winning 3 points against the opponent's paper), I'll continue with that.\n\nActually, wait, there's something seriously off with the way the game is reporting outcomes or the rules. The rule states:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n\nBut paper doesn't usually beat scissors in a standard rock-paper-scissors game. Scissors usually cuts paper. Maybe the rules are reversed or there's a miscommunication.\n\nOh, wait, I see the issue: I was thinking of standard rock-paper-scissors, but the rules here are actually different:\n\n- paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- rock beats paper (standard)\n- scissors beats rock (not the other way around)\n\nSo with this understanding:\n\nIf I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I should win because paper beats scissors. And indeed, I've won points in these cases (rounds 2, 8, 13).\n\nIf I play rock and opponent plays paper, I should win because rock beats paper. And indeed, I've won 3 points in these cases (rounds 1, 14, 16).\n\nIf I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I should win because scissors beats rock. And indeed, I've won 1 point in these cases (rounds 11, 15).\n\nIn round 12, I played rock and the opponent played scissors. According to the rules, scissors beats rock, so I should have lost. And indeed, I lost 1 point.\n\nThis makes more sense now. The rules are just different from traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\nOk, with that understanding, I should play strategically. I've had success with rock in the past couple of rounds, so the opponent might anticipate me playing rock again and play paper (as they've done in rounds 14 and 16). If they play paper, I should play scissors to win. But if they anticipate me playing scissors, they might play rock. It's a classic strategic game.\n\nGiven the pattern of the game so far, and the fact that I've played rock twice in a row (and won), I think the opponent might anticipate me playing rock again. To counter this, I'll go with paper.",

Let me review the game rules again and correct my analysis:\n\n- Paper beats rock: paper winner gets 3 points, rock loser gets -3 points\n- Rock beats scissors: rock winner gets 1 point, scissors loser gets -1 point\n- Scissors beats paper: scissors winner gets 1 point, paper loser gets -1 point\n\nLet me try again with the correct understanding:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper. Since paper beats rock, I should have lost 3 points, but the hint says I won 3 points. This is inconsistent with the rules.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Since scissors beats paper, I should have lost 1 point, but the hint says I won 1 point. This is also inconsistent.\n\nLet me re-read the game description more carefully. Oh, I see. There seems to be inconsistency between the game description and the actual gameplay. The description says:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nBut the actual gameplay seems reversed. Let me try to understand what's happening based on the actual gameplay:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points. This suggests rock beats paper.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point. This suggests paper beats scissors.\nRound 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point. This suggests scissors beats rock.\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point. This suggests scissors beats rock.\n\nSo the actual gameplay rules seem to be:\n- Rock beats paper (3 points)\n- Paper beats scissors (1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (1 point)\n\nBut this is still inconsistent with round 12 where I played rock, opponent played scissors, and I lost. Let me look at all rounds again:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point.\nRound 3-7, 9-10: Ties with same moves.\nRound 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point.\nRound 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point.\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point.\nRound 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point.\nRound 14: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points.\nRound 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point.\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points.\nRound 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me try once more with the exact wording from each round:\n\nRound 1: \"You won the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored 3 points.\"\nRound 2: \"You won the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors. You scored 1 points.\"\nRound 11: \"You won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored 1 points.\"\nRound 12: \"You lost the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: scissors. You scored -1 points.\"\nRound 13: \"You won the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors. You scored 1 points.\"\nRound 14: \"You won the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored 3 points.\"\nRound 15: \"You won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored 1 points.\"\nRound 16: \"You won the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored 3 points.\"\nRound 17: \"You won the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors. You scored 1 points.\"\n\nThere's definitely inconsistency between rounds. For example, in rounds 2, 13, and 17, I played paper against scissors and won 1 point. But according to the rules, scissors should beat paper.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that the feedback messages might have the moves reversed (showing my move as opponent's and vice versa). If that's the case:\n\nRound 1: Opponent played rock, I played paper, I won 3 points (paper beats rock).\nRound 2: Opponent played paper, I played scissors, I won 1 point (scissors beats paper).\n\nThat would be consistent with the rules. Let me check more rounds with this interpretation:\n\nRound 11: Opponent played scissors, I played rock, I won 1 point (rock beats scissors).\nRound 12: Opponent played rock, I played scissors, I lost 1 point (rock beats scissors).\nRound 13: Opponent played paper, I played scissors, I won 1 point (scissors beats paper).\nRound 14: Opponent played rock, I played paper, I won 3 points (paper beats rock).\nRound 15: Opponent played scissors, I played rock, I won 1 point (rock beats scissors).\n\nThis interpretation makes the outcomes consistent with the rules. But it would mean the feedback messages are systematically reporting the moves in reverse. That seems unlikely.\n\nGiven the confusion and inconsistencies, I'm going to go with what seems like the most likely pattern from the actual gameplay:\n\n- Rock beats paper (3 points)\n- Paper beats scissors (1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (1 point)\n\nFor the next round, I'll choose scissors, which seems to have done well against rock in rounds 11 and 15.",

So:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats paper (this is correct)\n- Scissors beats rock (not the other way around)\n\nSo the correct interpretation is:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock beats paper, so I won 3 points.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won 1 point.\n\nThat's consistent with the results I'm seeing.\n\nLet me re-analyze all rounds properly:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock beats paper, I won 3 points.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, I won 1 point.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie (0 points).\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points).\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie (0 points).\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie (0 points).\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points).\nRound 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, I won 1 point.\nRound 9: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie (0 points).\nRound 10: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points).\nRound 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock, I won 1 point.\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, I lost 1 point.\nRound 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, I won 1 point.\nRound 14: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock beats paper, I won 3 points.\nRound 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock, I won 1 point.\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock beats paper, I won 3 points.\nRound 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, I won 1 point.\nRound 18: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie (0 points).\n\nI notice that I've been winning quite consistently or getting ties. The opponent seems to often match my move, and when they don't, I tend to win. Let me continue with this pattern.\n\nI'll play rock this round since it has the potential for the highest point gain (3 points), and if my observation is right, the opponent might match my move leading to a tie, or I might win.",

They seem to be somewhat random.\n\nGiven the payoff structure, it seems that:\n- Rock is most valuable when playing against paper (3 points)\n- Paper is valuable against scissors (1 point)\n- Scissors is valuable against rock (1 point)\n\nGiven that rock has the highest potential payoff (3 points) and that the opponent has played paper in several recent rounds, I'll play rock again.",

Scissors beats rock, so I lost (-1 point).\nRound 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won (1 point).\nRound 14: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock beats paper, so I won (3 points).\nRound 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock, so I won (1 point).\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock beats paper, so I won (3 points).\nRound 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won (1 point).\nRound 18: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie (0 points).\nRound 19: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock beats paper, so I won (3 points).\nRound 20: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie (0 points).\nRound 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so I lost (-1 point).\nRound 22: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost (-1 point).\nRound 23: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so I lost (-1 point).\n\nLooking at this pattern, I've been doing quite well overall with a positive score. My opponent seems to be picking moves somewhat randomly, or perhaps is trying to counter my previous moves. \n\nSince this is a different version of rock-paper-scissors with reversed rules, let me try to identify the best strategy. In this game:\n- Rock is strongest (beats paper with 3 points)\n- Paper and scissors are balanced (each beats one thing with 1 point)\n\nSo far my strategy of cycling through rock, paper, scissors has been working reasonably well. For my next move, I'll play rock, as it has the highest potential payoff (3 points).",
