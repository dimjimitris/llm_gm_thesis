    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Against a player with unknown strategy, I should consider expected values:\n   - Rock has potential for highest gain but also highest loss\n   - Paper has moderate risk with moderate reward\n   - Scissors seems least favorable as the risk (-3 vs Rock) outweighs reward (+1 vs Paper)\n\n5. For a first move without opponent information, I'll choose a balanced option.\n\nFinal decision: I'll go with Paper as it offers a balanced risk profile.\n\n[move] Paper"

Looking at the pattern of the game:\n   - Rock is high-risk/high-reward (\u00b13 points)\n   - Paper and Scissors have more moderate outcomes (\u00b11 point)\n   - Since my opponent played Rock last time, they showed willingness to use the high-risk/high-reward strategy\n\n5. Since they've shown they're willing to play Rock for its high reward, I'll anticipate they might stick with this successful strategy.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors.

Updating my game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played Rock, opponent played Paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 4: I played Paper, opponent played Rock, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 6: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 7: I played Rock, opponent played Rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played Paper, opponent played Paper, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 11: I played Paper, opponent played Paper, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 12: I played Rock, opponent played Rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 13: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 14: I played Rock, opponent played Rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 15: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 16: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 17: I played Rock, opponent played Rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 18: I played Rock, opponent played Paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 19: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 20: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors, I won 1 point\n\n2. I need to verify the rule structure again based on these results:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Paper wins 1 point, Scissors loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats Paper: Rock wins 3 points, Paper loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats Rock: Scissors wins 1 point, Rock loses 1 point\n\n3. My opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - Round 19: Scissors\n   - Round 20: Scissors\n\n4. They've played Scissors twice in a row now.\n\n5. Given their tendency to repeat moves recently, they might play Scissors again. Alternatively, they could switch to Rock to counter my Paper play.\n\n6. Since Paper beat Scissors last round (winning 1 point), I should continue with this successful strategy.\n\n7. If they switch to Rock thinking I'll play Paper again, I'll lose 3 points. If they play Paper, we'll tie. But the most likely scenario is they'll play Scissors again based on their recent pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper again since it worked last round against their Scissors play.\n\n[move] Paper"

They've become less predictable, switching from Scissors to Rock.\n\n4. After I played Paper twice, they countered with Rock on my second Paper play.\n\n5. They might continue with Rock, expecting me to play Paper again, or switch to Paper if they think I'll play Rock.\n\n6. Scissors would be the safest option:\n   - Against Rock: Lose only 1 point\n   - Against Paper: Win 1 point\n   - Against Scissors: Tie (0 points)\n\n7. Rock would win more points against Scissors (3 points) but lose more against Paper (3 points).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors as it provides the best balance of risk and potential reward in this uncertain situation.\n\n[move] Scissors"
