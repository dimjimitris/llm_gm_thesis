    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I need to consider the expected value of each move assuming random play:\n   - Paper: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = +2/3 points\n   - Rock: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n   - Scissors: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\n3. Paper has the highest expected value in this asymmetric game.\n\n4. Additionally, rock is a common first move for many players, and paper would counter that effectively for +3 points.\n\n5. The potential loss with paper (-1 against scissors) is less severe than rock's potential loss (-3 against paper).\n\nFinal decision: I'll go with paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent has broken their previous pattern by playing rock twice in a row.\n\n3. Since they just had success with rock, they might:\n   - Play rock again (stick with what worked)\n   - Play scissors (anticipating I'll switch to rock)\n   - Play paper (to mix up their strategy)\n\n4. Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - If I play paper: Win vs scissors (+1), Lose vs rock (-3), Tie vs paper (0)\n   - If I play rock: Win vs paper (+3), Lose vs scissors (-1), Tie vs rock (0) \n   - If I play scissors: Win vs rock (+1), Lose vs paper (-1), Tie vs scissors (0)\n\n5. Given their success with rock, there's a good chance they'll play it again. Scissors would counter that effectively.\n\n6. Even if they switch to paper instead, my loss would be limited to -1 point.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their potential rock play.\n\n[move] scissors"

Let me analyze my recent game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n\n2. Looking at my opponent's last few moves:\n   paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n3. They seem to be alternating between paper and rock, which suggests they might play rock next.\n\n4. After their success with paper, they might:\n   - Stick with paper (thinking I'll avoid scissors after just losing with it)\n   - Switch to rock (continuing their alternating pattern)\n   - Play scissors (anticipating I might play paper)\n\n5. Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - If they play rock as predicted, scissors would win me +1 point\n   - If they play paper again, rock would win me +3 points\n   - If they play scissors, paper would win me +1 point\n\n6. Given their alternating pattern and recent success with paper, rock seems most likely to give me the highest payoff.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round.\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent's last three moves:\n   rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n3. They're on a three-round winning streak and seem to be cycling through the moves.\n\n4. If they continue this pattern, they would play rock next.\n\n5. Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - If they play rock as predicted, scissors would win me +1 point\n   - If they play scissors again, paper would win me +1 point\n   - If they play paper, rock would win me +3 points\n\n6.

The expected value of playing rock is higher than other options, and even in the worst case, the potential loss is minimal.\n\n5. After a loss, opponents often change strategy, which further increases the likelihood they'll switch from rock to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round to counter their likely paper play.\n\n[move] rock"
