Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Updated frequencies:\n   - Paper: 8 times\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 7 times (now tied with rock)\n\n4. After playing scissors, historically my opponent has played:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock (3 times)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper (4 times)\n\n5. This suggests paper is slightly more likely after they play scissors.\n\n6. If they play paper as predicted, scissors would be my best counter (winning 1 point).\n\n7. The risk with scissors is significant (losing 3 points if they play rock), but paper is still their most likely move based on their pattern after scissors.\n\n8. Given their higher frequency of paper moves overall, and their tendency to play paper after scissors, scissors seems like the most strategic choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors"

Updated frequencies:\n   - Paper: 8 times\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 8 times (now tied with paper for most frequent)\n\n4. They've now played scissors twice in a row, which they've never done before in this game.\n\n5. After playing scissors, historically my opponent has played:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock (3 times)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper (4 times)\n   - They've never played scissors three times in a row\n\n6. Given this is their first time playing scissors consecutively, they're likely to switch.\n\n7. Based on their previous patterns after scissors, paper seems slightly more likely than rock.\n\n8. If they play paper, scissors would win. If they play rock, paper would win.\n\n9. Given their historical tendency after scissors favors paper, and they rarely play the same move three times in a row, paper seems the optimal choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper"
