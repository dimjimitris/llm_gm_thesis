    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The key observation is that rock has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also the highest potential loss (-3 points). Let's analyze the expected values of each move against random play.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Looking at the payoff matrix, rock is high-risk/high-reward. Paper has moderate risk (-3 if opponent plays rock) but low reward (1 point if opponent plays scissors). Scissors has low risk (-1 if opponent plays paper) but also low reward (1 point if opponent plays rock).\n\n**Psychological Analyst**: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they might choose rock as it's a common first choice in traditional rock-paper-scissors. If they're strategic, they might anticipate this and choose paper instead.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: For the first move, balancing potential gain versus loss is important. Paper gives us protection against the high-damage rock move, while exposing us to only a -1 point loss if they choose scissors.\n\n**Game Theorist**: I recommend paper for the first move. It protects against the highest potential loss while giving us information about the opponent's strategy for future rounds.\n\n[move] paper"

Your opponent played rock in the first round, which gave them a significant advantage (+3 points). Now we need to decide if they're likely to stick with a winning move or anticipate your adaptation.\n\n**Psychological Analyst**: Players often stick with a winning strategy, especially when it gave them a large advantage. There's a decent chance they'll play rock again, particularly since it has the highest potential reward.\n\n**Pattern Analyst**: With only one round of history, it's hard to establish a pattern. But many players tend to repeat successful moves, at least in the short term.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If they do play rock again, scissors would be our optimal counter. And even if they switch to paper (anticipating our scissors), we would only lose 1 point rather than 3.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Considering the asymmetric payoffs, scissors presents a reasonable risk-reward ratio here. It could win us 1 point against rock, and would only lose 1 point against paper.\n\n**Game Theorist**: I agree. Scissors is the logical counter to their previous rock play, and the potential loss is minimized compared to other options.\n\n[move] scissors"

If they're following the standard rock-paper-scissors rotation (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock), they might play paper next.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: If we anticipate paper from the opponent, our best response would be rock, which would give us +3 points and them -3 points.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Playing rock is higher risk if our prediction is wrong. If they play scissors again, we'd lose 1 point. If they return to rock, we'd tie.\n\n**Psychological Analyst**: Since the last round was a tie, some players tend to switch their move rather than repeating.

If they play scissors, we'd only lose 1 point.\n\n**Psychological Analyst**: The opponent has been extremely consistent with their alternating pattern in recent rounds, suggesting they're likely to continue with paper next.\n\n[move] rock"

Scissors beats rock, I lost (-1)\n\n**Pattern Analyst**: The opponent's recent moves have been scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. They've broken their previous pattern. After our scissors win against their rock, they switched to scissors and won against our rock.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Given their recent scissors play, they might stick with scissors (since it won) or anticipate that we'll counter with paper and switch to rock.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If they continue with scissors, paper would be our optimal counter, giving us +1 point. If they switch to rock, paper would lose 3 points.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Considering the opponent's recent success with scissors and the rules of this game, paper seems to be our best move for this round.\n\n[move] paper"

If they anticipate we'll play paper again, they might switch to rock.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Scissors would be the safest move with limited downside. It would tie if they play scissors again, win if they switch to rock (+1), and only lose 1 point if they switch to paper.\n\n[move] scissors"
