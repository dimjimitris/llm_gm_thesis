Result: I won (1 point)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played rock. Result: Tie (0 points)\n\nMy opponent's pattern so far: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\nIt seems my opponent might be cycling through moves or responding to what I'm doing. Let's analyze their possible strategy:\n- They might be following a fixed pattern (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 ?)\n- They might be anticipating my next move based on my previous moves\n- They might be using a random strategy\n\nIf they're following a fixed pattern, their next move would likely be scissors.\nIf they're anticipating my moves, they might expect me to play paper (since rock just tied), in which case they'd play scissors.\n\nLooking at the point values again:\n- Paper beats rock: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n- Rock beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point  \n- Scissors beats paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\nGiven this analysis, I think playing paper is risky since the opponent seems to favor scissors when I play something other than rock. Playing scissors could be a good move - if they play rock again I only lose 1 point, but if they play paper I gain 1 point.",

The rules state that rock beats paper (not the other way around), giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points. This seems different from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules I'm familiar with, but I'll go with the rules as stated.\n\nGiven this clarification, my win in round 13 makes sense.\n\nNow I need to predict my opponent's next move:\n\nTheir pattern has been:\n- rock (rounds 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)\n- scissors (rounds 2, 4)\n- paper (round 12, 13)\n\nAfter sticking with rock for many rounds and then switching to paper for two rounds (and losing badly on the second paper play), they might:\n1. Go back to rock, which they seemed comfortable with for a long time\n2. Try scissors, which they haven't used in a while\n3. Continue with paper, hoping I won't play rock again\n\nSince I just played rock and won significantly (+3 points), they might expect me to play rock again. In that case, they'd play scissors to beat my rock.\n\nOr they might switch back to their comfort move (rock).",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
