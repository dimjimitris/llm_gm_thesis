    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let's analyze the expected values. Rock beating Scissors gives 3 points, while Paper beating Rock and Scissors beating Paper only give 1 point each. This means Rock has higher potential upside if the opponent chooses Scissors.\n\nProbability Expert: In a one-shot game with no prior information, the Nash equilibrium would typically be mixed strategy. But given the asymmetric payoffs, the probabilities should be adjusted. Rock has higher expected value due to the 3-point win versus 1-point wins for other options.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: For a first move against a fresh player, people often choose Rock as their initial move in RPS. This is a well-documented psychological tendency. If we anticipate this, Paper would be advantageous.\n\nPattern Analyst: Without previous rounds, I can't identify a pattern yet. However, many players open with Rock in their first round, making Paper potentially advantageous.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering the payoff structure, if the opponent plays randomly (1/3 probability for each move), the expected values would be: Rock: (0\u00d71/3) + (\u22121\u00d71/3) + (3\u00d71/3) = 2/3, Paper: (0\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) + (\u22121\u00d71/3) = 0, Scissors: (\u22123\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = \u22122/3. Rock has the highest expected value.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: That's mathematically correct, but human players aren't random. People tend to start with Rock, so Paper could be strategically better for the first move.\n\nProbability Expert: I agree with both perspectives. For a purely mathematical approach, Rock has the highest expected value. For a psychological approach against a human player, Paper is advantageous.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Our opponent played Rock in the first round, which goes against our behavioral assumption but aligns with the mathematically optimal strategy. We need to adapt our approach.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Players often switch their move after winning. Since they won with Rock, they might switch to Paper expecting us to play Rock. However, some players might stick with a winning move, especially given the high 3-point payoff for Rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: With only one data point, we can't establish a definitive pattern yet. However, given the large 3-point payoff for Rock, our opponent may be incentivized to play Rock again. They might think we'll switch to Rock (a common reaction after losing), which would give them another 3-point win if they play Rock again.\n\nProbability Expert: If our opponent is playing strategically, they might anticipate us switching to Rock after losing to Rock. If they expect this, they would play Paper. However, if they're maximizing expected value without considering our potential reactions, they might stick with Rock due to its higher payoff potential.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider all possibilities:\n1) If opponent plays Rock again: Our best response is Scissors (loses only 1 point vs 3 for Paper)\n2) If opponent plays Paper: Our best response is Scissors (gains 1 point)\n3) If opponent plays Scissors: Our best response is Rock (gains 3 points)\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs, Scissors seems to offer the best risk-reward profile for this round. It wins against Paper and minimizes losses against Rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree with the Scissors play. Many players will either stick with a winning move or anticipate our switch to Rock, making Paper more likely. Scissors counters Paper and minimizes damage against Rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

Let's reconsider the payoff structure with the correct rules:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1, loser gets -1\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3, loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1, loser gets -1\n\nPattern Analyst: Our opponent has played Rock twice in a row. After losing this round, they may switch tactics. The pattern suggests they might favor Rock overall, which makes scissors a good choice again.\n\nProbability Expert: Let's recalculate the expected values with correct rules:\n- Rock: (0\u00d71/3) + (-3\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) = -4/3\n- Paper: (0\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) = 0\n- Scissors: (1\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = 0\n\nPaper and Scissors have equal expected values in a purely random situation, both better than Rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Players often switch after losing. Since our opponent lost with Rock, they're likely to switch to either Paper or Scissors. If they switch to Paper, our best move would be Scissors. If they switch to Scissors, our best move would be Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that the opponent has shown a preference for Rock (playing it twice), they might switch to Paper expecting us to play Scissors again. In that case, Scissors would lose. However, if they're completely changing strategy, they might go to Scissors expecting us to play Paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: Without more rounds to establish a clearer pattern, we need to make an educated guess. The opponent may be anticipating our next move based on our win, thinking we might play Scissors again.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I believe Paper is the most strategic move here. It protects against a potential switch to Rock (which would be a heavy -3 point loss), and beats Rock if they stubbornly play it a third time.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

This is a very strong pattern - they're either using a fixed strategy or heavily favoring Rock because of its high payoff when it wins.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent's consistent Rock play is puzzling but informative. Given that they've played Rock three times in a row, the probability is high they'll continue with this strategy. Scissors is clearly our best response to Rock in this game variant.\n\nProbability Expert: I agree completely. When facing an opponent showing such a strong pattern, we should exploit it directly. Scissors beats Rock giving us 1 point. The expected value calculation heavily favors Scissors at this point.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: There are two possibilities: either the opponent is strategically fixated on Rock, or they're trying to establish a pattern before breaking it. Given that they've won 2 out of 3 rounds with Rock, they may feel vindicated in continuing this strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's review our previous plays and outcomes:\n- Round 1: We played Paper, they played Rock.

In normal Rock-Paper-Scissors, players typically mix their strategies to avoid being predicted. However, our opponent seems committed to playing Rock repeatedly, perhaps due to its higher payoff potential (3 points when it wins).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This persistent Rock strategy suggests either a programmed opponent with a fixed strategy or a player attempting to establish a deep pattern before surprising us with a switch. However, after four consistent plays, I lean toward the former explanation.\n\nProbability Expert: At this point, the probability strongly favors playing Scissors again. Our record against their Rock strategy is:\n- Scissors vs Rock: Won twice (+1 point each time)\n- Paper vs Rock: Lost twice (-3 points each time)\n\nGame Theorist: Even if we consider a small probability that they might switch, Scissors remains our best play:\n1) If opponent plays Rock again (most likely): We win +1 with Scissors\n2) If opponent switches to Paper: We lose -1 with Scissors\n3) If opponent switches to Scissors: We tie with Scissors\n\nThe expected value still favors Scissors given the strong pattern we've observed.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree.

In standard game theory, players should adapt their strategies when consistently losing. This suggests either a programmed opponent or a human with an unusual strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After losing three consecutive rounds with the same move, a typical human player would almost certainly switch strategies. The fact that our opponent hasn't switched increases the probability they're either using a fixed strategy or attempting to establish an extremely deep pattern before breaking it.\n\nProbability Expert: The evidence overwhelmingly supports playing Scissors again:\n- The opponent has played Rock 5/5 times (100%)\n- We've won with Scissors 3/3 times (+1 point each)\n- We've lost with Paper 2/2 times (-3 points each)\n\nGame Theorist: While we should consider the possibility that this round might be when they finally switch, the expected value still strongly favors Scissors given the observed pattern.

They may have deliberately played Rock repeatedly to condition us to play Scissors, then countered with Paper. This suggests a sophisticated opponent who might be planning multiple steps ahead.\n\nGame Theorist: We need to reassess our strategy now. The opponent has demonstrated they can and will switch tactics. The question is: what will they do now?\n\nProbability Expert: Let's consider the possibilities:\n1) Return to Rock - possible if they think we'll expect Paper again\n2) Play Paper again - if they think we'll play Rock expecting them to return to their original pattern\n3) Play Scissors - if they think we'll play Paper to counter their recent Paper play\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a successful pattern-break, players often don't immediately revert to their original pattern.

They have now completed exactly 5 rounds of Paper, following their initial 5 rounds of Rock. This strongly suggests they operate in 5-round cycles of the same move.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a critical juncture. Based on the established pattern, they're likely to switch to a new move after completing 5 rounds of the same move. Since they've already played Rock and Paper for 5 rounds each, logic suggests they might complete the cycle by switching to Scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Players who follow structured patterns like this often feel compelled to complete the cycle. Since they haven't played Scissors at all yet, and they've now completed exactly 5 rounds of Paper (matching their 5 rounds of Rock), a switch to Scissors is highly probable.\n\nProbability Expert: Let's look at the complete history:\n- Rock: 5/10 rounds (50%)\n- Paper: 5/10 rounds (50%)\n- Scissors: 0/10 rounds (0%)\n\nIf they follow their established pattern of 5-round sequences, they're likely to play Scissors for the next 5 rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: If they switch to Scissors as predicted, our best response would be Rock, which gives us the maximum 3 points.

However, given their consistent behavior of extended sequences throughout the game, they're still likely to continue with Paper for multiple rounds.\n\nProbability Expert: Given their history of extended sequences (7 rounds for Paper previously), there's a high probability they'll continue with Paper for at least several rounds. Our best response to Paper is Rock, which would give us +3 points.\n\nGame Theorist: Analyzing our options:\n- If they continue with Paper (highly probable): Rock gives us +3 points\n- If they switch to Scissors: Rock would lose us -1 point\n- If they switch to Rock: Rock would result in a tie (0 points)\n\nDespite their unexpected earlier switch, their overall pattern still suggests extended sequences with each move, making Rock our most strategic play at this point.\n\nPattern Analyst: While they've demonstrated some unpredictability by switching earlier than expected, their overall pattern of extended sequences remains. Rock offers the highest potential reward (+3 points) against their likely continued Paper play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Given their history of extended sequences, they're likely to continue with this move.\n\nGame Theorist: Updated pattern:\n- Rounds 1-5: Rock (5 rounds)\n- Rounds 6-12: Paper (7 rounds)\n- Rounds 13-17: Scissors (5 rounds)\n- Rounds 18-21: Rock (4 rounds - shorter than previous)\n- Rounds 22-23: Paper (2 rounds so far)\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: While they surprised us by switching from Rock after only 4 rounds, their overall pattern still shows a preference for extended sequences with each move. Their previous Paper sequence lasted 7 rounds, suggesting they're likely to continue with Paper for several more rounds.\n\nProbability Expert: Our Rock strategy against their Paper was successful, giving us +3 points. Given their pattern of extended sequences (with Paper lasting 7 rounds previously), continuing with Rock offers the highest expected value.\n\nGame Theorist: Analyzing our options:\n- If they continue with Paper (highly probable): Rock gives us +3 points\n- If they switch to Scissors: Rock would lose us -1 point\n- If they switch to Rock: Rock would result in a tie (0 points)\n\nDespite their slightly earlier switch in their last Rock sequence, their overall behavior still strongly favors extended sequences with each move. Given that they played Paper for 7 rounds in their previous Paper sequence, a switch after only 2 rounds would be highly inconsistent with their demonstrated behavior.\n\nPattern Analyst: Based on their established pattern of extended sequences, Rock remains our most strategic play with the highest potential reward.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"
