    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This suggests they might be more strategic than a typical \"fresh player\" or they were also trying to counter the expected rock bias. This could indicate they're thinking one level deeper than basic instinct.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Now we have one data point. The opponent chose paper. This tells us they may not follow the typical beginner pattern. However, one data point isn't enough to establish a pattern. We should still consider that they might switch strategies after a tie.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie changes the dynamic. Many players after a tie will either: 1) stick with the same move thinking it was \"good,\" 2) switch to beat what they just played (rock to beat paper), or 3) try to anticipate our next move. Given they played paper (potentially strategic), they might expect us to switch.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After ties, there's often a psychological tendency to change moves. If they think we'll switch from paper, they might play rock to beat scissors, or scissors to beat paper. There's also the \"matching\" tendency where players sometimes repeat the tied move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they showed strategic thinking with paper, and considering post-tie psychology, I'm thinking scissors might be good. If they expect me to change and play rock to counter their potential rock, scissors would beat that. It also beats paper if they stick with their previous move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Scissors is reasonable. It covers the scenario where they repeat paper or if they try to counter-predict with rock. Good reasoning.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (After the tie with paper, going with scissors to counter either a repeat paper or anticipated rock) scissors"

This shows they are switching moves, which is actually good strategic behavior. The sequence paper \u2192 rock suggests they might be following some pattern or trying to be unpredictable.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent switched from paper to rock after the tie. This confirms they're not a completely naive player - they're adapting. However, the paper \u2192 rock sequence could indicate they're going through the moves in some order, or they anticipated our potential switch. Now they might expect us to switch again since we won.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Two moves isn't enough to establish a clear pattern, but the switch from paper to rock suggests they're not random and not sticking to one move. If they continue switching, the next logical move in a cycle would be scissors. However, they might also be trying to counter-predict our next move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they switched from paper to rock, if they're following any kind of sequence, scissors might be next. But they could also be thinking strategically about what I might play after winning. Since I won with scissors, they might expect me to either repeat scissors or switch. If they expect me to repeat scissors, they'd play rock again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's a winner's bias where successful moves are sometimes repeated, but also a tendency to switch after success to stay unpredictable. The opponent might anticipate either behavior from us.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the uncertainty, paper seems reasonable. It beats rock (if they repeat), loses to scissors (if they complete a sequence), and ties with paper (if they cycle back). It's a balanced choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Opponent switched from paper to rock, so playing paper to counter potential rock repeat or defensive play) paper"

This is a complete cycle through all three moves in sequence! If they're following this pattern, the next move should be paper (returning to the start of the cycle).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a very common pattern among players who think they're being \"strategic\" by cycling through moves. It feels random to them but is actually quite predictable. Many players do this thinking it covers all bases, but it's exactly the kind of pattern humans fall into when trying to be unpredictable.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If the pattern holds (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper), then rock would be the optimal counter for their next expected paper. However, we should also consider they might realize they're in a losing streak and break the pattern. They've lost two rounds in a row now.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern seems very clear: they're cycling through paper, rock, scissors in order. If they continue this pattern, paper is next, which means I should play rock. But I'm also concerned they might catch on to their pattern since they've lost twice.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players often don't realize they're in predictable patterns, especially when under pressure from losing. The psychological tendency is to continue the pattern they think is \"strategic\" rather than recognize it's predictable.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Three consecutive moves in perfect sequence is strong evidence for the pattern. The probability of this being random is quite low.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Rock is the logical choice if the pattern holds. Even if they break the pattern, rock still gives us a 1/3 random chance against any other move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Opponent has cycled paper-rock-scissors, so expecting paper next and countering with rock) rock"

The sequence is now: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. They didn't return to paper as expected in the cycle, but instead repeated rock. This suggests either: 1) they broke the pattern consciously, 2) there was no pattern to begin with, or 3) they're starting a new pattern.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that they played rock again after losing twice and then tying suggests they might be frustrated or changing strategy. Repeating rock could indicate they're either sticking with what just worked (the tie) or they're trying to be less predictable by breaking their apparent cycle.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** With the pattern broken, we have less predictive power. However, they just played rock twice in a row (moves 2 and 4). If they're falling into a new pattern of repeating moves, they might play rock again. Alternatively, they might switch away from rock since it just tied.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The broken pattern is significant. They moved from what looked like a systematic cycle to repeating rock. If they continue with rock, paper would win. But they might also be thinking that I'll expect rock and switch to something else.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a tie, there's often a psychological tendency to either repeat the move (since it \"worked\" to not lose) or switch away from it. The double rock (positions 2 and 4) might indicate they feel comfortable with rock or see it as strong.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Given the uncertainty, we need to make a decision with limited information.

After the initial paper, there's a clear alternating pattern emerging: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. If this pattern continues, the next move should be rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating! They started with what looked like a full cycle (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), but then settled into alternating between rock and scissors. This suggests they might have abandoned paper entirely after it resulted in a tie and losses. They seem to be focusing on the two moves that have given them the most \"success\" (even though they lost with both).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The alternating rock-scissors pattern is very strong evidence. Positions 2,3,4,5 show rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. If they continue this alternation, position 6 should be rock. Paper would be the optimal counter.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern seems very clear now. After abandoning paper, they're alternating rock and scissors. Given that their last move was scissors (position 5), rock should be next in the alternation. Paper beats rock, so that should be my play.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players often abandon moves that they associate with poor outcomes. Since their paper led to a tie and they lost the subsequent rounds, they might be avoiding it. The rock-scissors alternation feels \"strategic\" to them.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Four consecutive moves following the rock-scissors alternation pattern is statistically significant.

Instead of playing rock after scissors (round 7), they played scissors again in round 8.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is significant! After 6 moves of perfect rock-scissors alternation, they suddenly repeated scissors. This could mean: 1) they realized the pattern was predictable, 2) they're starting a new pattern, or 3) they're becoming more random. The double scissors suggests a shift in strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The pattern break changes everything. We can no longer rely on the alternating rock-scissors prediction. With scissors played twice in a row (rounds 7-8), we need to consider what comes next. They might continue with scissors, switch to rock, or even return to paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The double scissors is a major development. After being so predictable for 6 rounds, they've broken their pattern. This could indicate they're either: falling into a new pattern (repeating scissors), trying to be more unpredictable, or consciously breaking patterns.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players who break established patterns often do so because they sense they're being predictable or because they're frustrated with results. The question is whether this is a one-time deviation or a new strategy.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** With the pattern broken, we have limited predictive power. However, scissors has now appeared in the last two moves, which might indicate either a new repetition pattern or complete randomness.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the uncertainty, we should probably play the move that covers the most likely scenarios. If they continue with scissors, rock would win. If they return to the alternating pattern, rock would be next and paper would counter. Rock seems like a reasonable choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Pattern broken with double scissors, playing rock to counter potential scissors continuation) rock"

The recent pattern is: scissors (round 7) \u2192 scissors (round 8) \u2192 rock (round 9). So we've gone from the double scissors back to rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Interesting! After breaking their alternating pattern with double scissors, they've now played rock. This could suggest they're either: 1) returning to some form of alternating pattern, 2) starting a new sequence, or 3) becoming more genuinely random. The scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock sequence is the most recent data.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** With scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock as the recent pattern, we need to predict what comes next. They could continue with another rock (repeating), switch back to scissors (continuing alternation), or try something completely different like returning to paper for the first time since round 1.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Looking at the recent moves, after the double scissors disruption, they played rock. If they're trying to resume some kind of alternating pattern, scissors might be next. Alternatively, they might repeat rock since it just achieved a tie (which stopped a losing streak for them).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The tie with rock might psychologically reinforce rock as a \"good\" move for them, potentially leading to repetition. However, they've shown they can break patterns when they realize they're predictable.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The data is becoming more complex and less predictable. However, given their history of alternating and the recent rock play, scissors seems plausible as the next move in some form of alternating pattern.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play scissors next, rock would beat it. If they repeat rock, paper would beat it. Rock covers the scissors scenario, which seems slightly more likely given their historical pattern preferences.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (After tie with rock, expecting possible return to scissors in alternating pattern, so playing rock to counter) rock"

After 8 rounds without using paper, they've brought it back. This suggests they might be: 1) cycling through all three moves again, 2) trying to be less predictable by reintroducing their \"forgotten\" move, or 3) starting a completely new strategy. The return of paper breaks any remaining pattern assumptions.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The paper return changes everything. We now have all three moves appearing in recent rounds. If they're trying to cycle through moves or be more unpredictable, we can't rely on previous patterns. We need to think about what they might do after reintroducing paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The return to paper after 8 rounds is the biggest strategic shift we've seen. They might be: completing a cycle, testing our reactions, or genuinely trying to be more random. Given the recent sequence scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, they've now used all three moves in the last 4 rounds.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After successfully using paper (their first use since round 1), they might feel confident about continuing with it, or they might switch away thinking we'll expect them to repeat. The psychology of reintroducing a \"forgotten\" move is complex.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** With paper back in play and no clear pattern, we're essentially back to dealing with high uncertainty. However, they haven't repeated paper yet in this game (unlike rock and scissors which they've repeated).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the uncertainty, scissors might be a good choice.

They've found their strategy and are sticking with it regardless of outcomes. This level of repetition suggests they either: 1) believe rock is unbeatable, 2) are comfortable with the predictability, or 3) have given up on strategic variation entirely.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Five identical moves in a row is the strongest possible evidence for pattern continuation. There's virtually no doubt they'll play rock again. Scissors beats rock according to the rules, making scissors the obvious and optimal choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is the clearest pattern in the entire game. Five consecutive rocks shows they've abandoned all other strategies and committed completely to rock. Scissors is the only logical response.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Five consecutive identical moves removes virtually all uncertainty. This isn't a pattern anymore - it's their established exclusive strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** At this point, breaking from rock would be more surprising than continuing with it. They're psychologically locked in.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Scissors is not just optimal - it's the only rational choice given this overwhelming evidence.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Five consecutive rocks shows complete commitment to rock-only strategy, playing scissors to counter inevitable sixth rock) scissors"

The probability of this occurring randomly is approximately 0.14% - virtually impossible. They have completely abandoned all other moves.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Six consecutive rocks represents total strategic commitment. This is no longer a pattern - it's their entire game plan. They've psychologically decided that rock is their only move, regardless of consequences. This level of repetition suggests they're either testing our ability to adapt or have genuinely given up on strategic variation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Six identical moves eliminates all uncertainty. This is the most predictable scenario possible in rock-paper-scissors. Scissors beats rock, making scissors not just optimal but mathematically certain to succeed.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** There is zero doubt at this point. Six consecutive rocks means they will play rock again. This is their established and unwavering strategy. Scissors is the guaranteed counter.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** We're beyond statistical analysis now - this is deterministic behavior. They will play rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Breaking this pattern after six moves would be psychologically extraordinary.

The sequence is now: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. This completely shatters our predictive model. After establishing the strongest possible pattern (six identical moves), they've suddenly switched strategies.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is extraordinary! Breaking a six-move pattern is psychologically significant. They either: 1) realized they were being too predictable and consciously changed, 2) got frustrated with losing and decided to mix things up, or 3) are testing whether we've locked into expecting rock. This shows they're still strategically aware.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Six rocks followed by paper completely resets our analysis. We can no longer assume they're committed to rock-only play. They've demonstrated they can and will break even the strongest patterns. This makes them much more dangerous as an opponent.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This changes everything! They've shown they can break from even the most established patterns when necessary. The question now is: was this a one-time switch to confuse us, or are they returning to more varied play?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After breaking such a strong pattern, they might feel empowered to be more unpredictable. Alternatively, they might return to rock since it was their \"comfort zone,\" or they might continue with paper to establish a new pattern.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** With the pattern completely broken, we're back to high uncertainty. However, the fact that they chose paper (which beats scissors) suggests they might have been thinking about our likely response to rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is tricky. They could continue with paper, return to rock, or go to scissors. Given the uncertainty, I lean toward rock - it covers the paper scenario (rock beats paper) and was their preferred move historically.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Major pattern break with paper after six rocks, playing rock to counter potential paper continuation) rock"

After the major pattern break with paper, they immediately returned to rock! This suggests the paper was a strategic deviation rather than a permanent strategy change.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Very telling! They broke their six-rock pattern with paper, but then immediately went back to rock. This suggests rock is still their psychological comfort zone. The paper might have been a conscious attempt to be unpredictable, but they've reverted to their preferred move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The return to rock after the paper deviation is significant. It suggests they still favor rock as their primary strategy, with occasional deviations to keep us guessing. Given this behavior, rock seems likely to continue as their preferred choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern seems to be: establish rock dominance, throw in occasional surprises (like paper), then return to rock. They've shown they can break patterns when needed, but rock appears to be their base strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The immediate return to rock after paper suggests they feel most comfortable with rock. The paper was likely a tactical decision rather than a strategic shift.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** While we can't be certain, the evidence suggests rock remains their preferred move, with occasional deviations. If they play rock again, scissors would win.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their historical preference for rock and the immediate return to rock after the paper deviation, scissors seems like the optimal play.

After the initial paper deviation, they seem to have settled into alternating between rock and paper! The last two moves were rock (round 22) \u2192 paper (round 23).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Interesting development! After breaking the six-rock pattern, they haven't returned to rock-only play. Instead, they've adopted a rock-paper alternation. This shows strategic evolution - they're maintaining some predictability while adding variation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they're alternating rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, then after paper in round 23, rock should be next in the alternation. According to the rules, scissors beats rock, so scissors would be the optimal counter.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The alternation makes sense! After realizing pure rock was too predictable, they've moved to rock-paper alternation. This gives them variation while still maintaining a pattern. If rock is next in the alternation, scissors should counter it.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Alternating between two moves is a common compromise strategy - it feels more varied than repeating one move, but simpler than cycling through all three moves.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Two data points for rock-paper alternation isn't conclusive, but given their pattern-following tendencies throughout the game, this seems like their new strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Scissors is the clear choice if they continue the rock-paper alternation with rock next. Even if they break the pattern, scissors has been effective against their rock-heavy play style.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Rock-paper alternation established after six-rock streak, expecting rock next so playing scissors to counter) scissors"
