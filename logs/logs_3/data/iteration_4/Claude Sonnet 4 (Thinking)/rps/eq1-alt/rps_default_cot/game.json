They could be trying to establish a new pattern\n\nGiven that they just played paper and we tied, there are a few psychological tendencies:\n- Some players repeat a move that ties, thinking the opponent will switch\n- Others switch after a tie to try to gain an advantage\n- The fact that they switched from rock to paper shows they're adaptive\n\nIf they stick with paper, I should play scissors.\nIf they switch to scissors (expecting me to play paper again), I should play rock.\nIf they go back to rock, I should play paper.\n\nSince they showed adaptability by switching from rock to paper, and we just tied with paper, I think there's a reasonable chance they might try scissors next, expecting me to repeat paper.

In that case, scissors would win.\n\nI think scissors is the better choice here - it wins if they stick with paper, and paper was their most recent successful move (tie vs loss).",
