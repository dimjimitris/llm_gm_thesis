The game description says:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo rock should beat scissors, not lose to it. But the hint says I lost when I played rock and my opponent played scissors. This seems like an error in the game description or the hint.\n\nLet me re-read the rules:\n- paper beats scissors \n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo according to the rules, scissors should beat rock, which means I should have lost -1 points when I played rock and my opponent played scissors. That matches what the hint said.\n\nSo the game rules are correct. Now for the next round, I need to think about what my opponent might do. They just played scissors and won. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors since it worked\n2. Switch to something else thinking I'll counter with paper (which beats scissors)\n3. Try to predict what I'll do\n\nSince I played rock last time and lost, they might expect me to switch. If they think I'll play paper (to beat scissors), they might play rock. If they think I'll play scissors (to beat paper), they might play rock. \n\nActually, let me think about this more systematically. This is essentially a game theory problem. In a one-shot game with no information, the optimal strategy is to randomize equally between all three options. But since we're playing multiple rounds, there might be patterns.\n\nFor this round, I'll try scissors since my opponent just played scissors and won - they might not expect me to copy their winning move.",

In round 1, they beat my rock with scissors. In round 2, they played rock (which would have beaten paper if I had played paper, but I played scissors which beat their rock).\n\nThis could be:\n1. Random play\n2. A pattern where they're cycling through moves\n3. They're trying to counter what they think I'll play\n\nSince there's not much data yet, I should consider:\n- If they're cycling: scissors -> rock -> paper next\n- If they're trying to counter me: they might expect me to play rock (since scissors won last time) and play paper\n- If it's random, any move is equally likely\n\nI think I'll go with paper this time, as it would beat rock if they continue the pattern, and it's different from my last two moves.",

I've been consistently losing because I keep thinking the opponent is following a scissors-rock-paper cycle, but I'm clearly wrong about the pattern.\n\nLet me look at the actual sequence of opponent moves:\n1. scissors (I played rock, lost)\n2. rock (I played scissors, won)\n3. paper (I played paper, tie)\n4. scissors (I played rock, lost)\n5. rock (I played paper, lost)\n6. paper (I played scissors, lost)\n7. scissors (I played rock, lost)\n8. rock (I played paper, lost)\n9. paper (I played scissors, lost)\n10. scissors (I played rock, lost)\n11. rock (I played paper, lost)\n12. paper (I played scissors, lost)\n13. scissors (I played rock, lost)\n14. rock (I played paper, lost)\n15. paper (I played scissors, lost)\n16. scissors (I played rock, lost)\n17. rock (I played paper, lost)\n18. paper (I played scissors, lost)\n19. scissors (I played rock, lost)\n\nSo the opponent's sequence is: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors...\n\nIt IS a scissors-rock-paper cycle! But I've been predicting it wrong. Let me check:\n\nIf they cycle scissors-rock-paper, then:\nPosition 1: scissors\nPosition 2: rock  \nPosition 3: paper\nPosition 4: scissors (back to position 1)\nPosition 5: rock (back to position 2)\nPosition 6: paper (back to position 3)\nAnd so on...\n\nSo the next move (position 20) should be rock (since 20 mod 3 = 2, which corresponds to rock).\n\nTo beat rock, I need to play paper.\n\nWait, let me double-check my counting:\n\n\n1. scissors\n2. rock\n3. paper\n4. scissors \n5. rock\n6. paper\n7. scissors\n8. rock\n9. paper\n10. scissors\n11. rock\n12. paper\n13. scissors\n14. rock\n15. paper\n16. scissors\n17. rock\n18. paper\n19. scissors\n20. should be rock\n\nI've confirmed the pattern. The opponent follows a predictable scissors-rock-paper sequence, and the 20th move will definitely be rock. My winning strategy is to play paper.",

Let me re-read the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors (so if they play scissors, I should play paper)\n- rock beats paper (so if they play paper, I should play rock)  \n- scissors beats rock (so if they play rock, I should play scissors)\n\nBut I keep saying \"paper beats rock\" which is wrong! Rock beats paper!\n\nLet me correct this:\n- If opponent plays scissors next, I should play rock (rock beats scissors)\n- If opponent plays rock next, I should play paper (paper beats rock)\n- If opponent plays paper next, I should play scissors (scissors beats paper)\n\nThe pattern is scissors-rock-paper-scissors-rock-paper...\n\n\nI need to carefully analyze the scoring and my strategy. The point system reveals critical nuances about winning and losing. Each move has specific consequences, and I must align my choices precisely with the opponent's predictable cycle.\n\nIf the sequence truly follows scissors-rock-paper, my optimal counter would be paper to neutralize their expected scissors move. However, I recognize my previous attempts have failed, so I must scrutinize my approach with heightened precision.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
