      "reasoning_text": "Let me think through this step-by-step.\n\nSteps to consider for winning:\n\n1. I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent) \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Same moves = tie (0 points for both)\n\n2. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new or inexperienced.\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, I need to make a decision based on general game theory principles.\n\n4. In rock-paper-scissors, the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with equal probability (1/3 each) to be unpredictable.\n\n5. However, against inexperienced players, there are some common patterns:\n   - Many beginners tend to start with rock (it's often the first move people think of)\n   - Some people go with scissors as it feels more \"aggressive\"\n   - Paper is sometimes overlooked as it seems \"passive\"\n\n6. If I assume the opponent might play rock (common beginner move), then I should play paper to win.\n\n7. But I also need to consider that they might be thinking about what I'm thinking, so there's a layer of psychology here.\n\n8. For the first move against an unknown player, I'll go with a balanced approach but lean slightly toward paper since rock is a common first choice for new players.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper.",
