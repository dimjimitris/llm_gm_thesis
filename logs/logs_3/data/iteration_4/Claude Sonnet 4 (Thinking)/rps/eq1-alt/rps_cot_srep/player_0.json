    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Fresh players commonly have predictable patterns - they often choose \"rock\" as their first move since it's psychologically the most straightforward and aggressive choice.\n\n3. To counter a likely \"rock\" move, I should choose \"paper\" since paper beats rock.\n\n4. This gives me the best statistical chance of winning +1 point while minimizing my risk of losing -1 point.\n\n5. Even if I'm wrong about their choice, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing - but my reasoning gives me a slight edge.\n\n[move] paper"

Fresh players often exhibit one of two behaviors after a win:\n   - Stick with the winning move (rock again)\n   - Think one level ahead and switch, expecting me to counter their previous move\n\n3. The most common fresh player behavior is to stick with what worked, so rock is still likely.\n\n4. Some fresh players might switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper to counter their previous rock.\n\n5. Between these two most probable scenarios (rock or scissors), playing paper covers the more likely scenario (rock) and gives me the best chance to recover my point deficit.\n\n6. I need to start building positive points, so taking the higher probability play makes sense.\n\n[move] paper"

After winning twice with the same move, a fresh player might:\n   - Continue with rock (since it's working perfectly)\n   - Switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper again to counter their previous rocks\n\n3. If they stick with rock again, playing paper would win, but I've tried that twice and failed.\n\n4. If they've switched to scissors (anticipating my paper), then rock would beat their scissors.\n\n5. Playing rock gives me:\n   - A win if they switched to scissors\n   - A tie if they stick with rock\n   - Only loses if they switched to paper (least likely)\n\n6. This breaks my losing pattern while covering the most probable scenarios for what a fresh player might do after two rock wins.\n\n[move] rock"
