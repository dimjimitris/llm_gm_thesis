I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new/inexperienced\n4. My objective is to maximize points and minimize penalties\n\nSteps to consider:\n\n1. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to make an educated guess about what a \"fresh player\" might do.\n\n2. Fresh/new players often have common patterns:\n   - They might choose rock first (it's often the first thing people think of)\n   - They might choose scissors (it's the last in the common \"rock-paper-scissors\" phrase)\n   - They might overthink and choose paper thinking others will choose rock\n\n3. If I assume the opponent is likely to choose rock (which is very common for first-time/fresh players), then I should choose paper to beat rock.\n\n4. However, I should also consider that this could be reverse psychology - maybe they expect me to think they'll choose rock, so they choose paper instead.\n\n5. Given the limited information and that this is just one round, I'll go with the statistical tendency that fresh players often choose rock on their first move.\n\nTherefore, I should choose paper to beat rock.",

You scored -1 points.\"\n\nBut according to the game rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo if I made paper and opponent made rock, then rock beats paper, so I should lose and get -1 points. That matches what happened.\n\nNow for the next round, I need to think about what this tells me about my opponent:\n\n1. They chose rock in the first round\n2. They're described as a \"fresh player\"\n3. I lost, so I need to adjust my strategy\n\nFor fresh players, there are a few common patterns:\n- They might stick with rock because it \"worked\"\n- They might think I'll expect them to play rock again and switch\n- They might have no real strategy and just pick randomly\n\nGiven that rock worked for them, many players (especially newer ones) tend to stick with what works. But some might think one level ahead and switch.\n\nLet me consider my options:\n- If they play rock again, I should play paper\n- If they switch to scissors (thinking I'll play paper to counter their rock), I should play rock\n- If they switch to paper (less likely but possible), I should play scissors\n\nI think the most likely scenario is they either:\n1. Stick with rock (because it worked)\n2. Switch to scissors (thinking I'll play paper to counter their previous rock)\n\nGiven these two most likely scenarios, paper covers scenario 1, and rock covers scenario 2. I need to make a choice.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. Since I'm trying to maximize points, I should think about what gives me the best expected value. But since I don't have enough data about this player's patterns yet, I should probably go with what feels most likely based on typical fresh player behavior.\n \nI'll choose paper to counter their likely rock strategy, hoping to win this round and gain points.",

Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
