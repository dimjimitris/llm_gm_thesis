Wait, let me re-read this...\n\nThe hint says \"You won the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors. You scored 1 points.\"\n\nBut according to the game rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo if I played paper and opponent played scissors, paper should beat scissors, meaning I should win. But that doesn't seem right according to the standard rules of rock-paper-scissors. Let me check the rules again:\n\nFrom the description:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nWait, this is different from standard rock-paper-scissors! In this version:\n- paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- rock beats paper \n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo in standard rock-paper-scissors, scissors beats paper, but in this game, paper beats scissors. That means I did win the round correctly.\n\nNow for the next move, I need to think about what the opponent might do. They played scissors in the first round and lost. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors\n2. Switch to something that beats paper (rock, according to these rules)\n3. Try to counter what they think I'll play next\n\nSince I won with paper, they might expect me to play paper again, so they might play rock to beat it. Or they might think I'll switch, so they could play anything.\n\nI think I'll go with rock this time, trying to beat paper in case they think I'll stick with paper and they try to counter it.",

Let me check the rules again:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.  \n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nWait, so paper beats scissors? That's unusual - in standard rock-paper-scissors, scissors beats paper. But according to these rules, paper beats scissors. So I did win round 1.\n\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points.\n\nSo the pattern so far:\nRound 1: Opponent played scissors\nRound 2: Opponent played rock\n\nThe opponent might be trying different moves or could be trying to counter what they think I'll do. Since I played paper then rock, they might expect scissors next. Or they might think I'm going in some pattern.\n\nI should try to think about what they might do. They played scissors (lost), then rock (tied). They might try paper next to complete the cycle, or they might try to counter what they think I'll play.\n\nIf they think I'm going in order (paper, rock, scissors), they might play rock to beat my expected scissors.\nIf they think I'll repeat rock since it tied, they might play paper.\nIf they're being random, it's hard to predict.\n\nI think I'll go with scissors this time.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
