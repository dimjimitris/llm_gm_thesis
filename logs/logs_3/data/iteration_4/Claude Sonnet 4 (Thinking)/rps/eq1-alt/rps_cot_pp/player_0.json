    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the complete pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: opponent played scissors (I won with paper)\n   - Round 2: opponent played rock (tied with rock)\n   - Round 3: opponent played paper (I won with rock)\n   - Round 4: opponent played scissors (I lost with rock)\n   - Round 5: opponent played rock (I won with scissors)\n   - Round 6: opponent played paper (I won with rock)\n   - Round 7: opponent played scissors (I lost with rock)\n   - Round 8: opponent played rock (I won with scissors)\n   - Round 9: opponent played paper (I won with rock)\n   - Round 10: opponent played scissors (I lost with rock)\n   - Round 11: opponent played rock (I won with scissors)\n   - Round 12: opponent played paper (I won with rock)\n   - Round 13: opponent played scissors (I lost with rock)\n   - Round 14: opponent played rock (I won with scissors)\n   - Round 15: opponent played paper (I won with rock)\n   - Round 16: opponent played scissors (I lost with rock)\n   - Round 17: opponent played rock (I won with scissors)\n   - Round 18: opponent played paper (I won with rock)\n   - Round 19: opponent played scissors (I lost with rock)\n   - Round 20: opponent played rock (I won with scissors)\n   - Round 21: opponent played paper (I won with rock)\n   - Round 22: opponent played scissors (I lost with rock)\n   - Round 23: opponent played rock (I won with scissors)\n\n2. Confirm the perfect cycle continues: The opponent has maintained the exact 3-move cycle (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper) for 23 consecutive rounds without any deviation.\n\n3. Predict next move: Following the established cycle, opponent should play paper next (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper).\n\n4. Choose the counter-move: According to the rules, rock beats paper, so I should play rock.\n\n5. Validate confidence: Twenty-three rounds of perfect pattern adherence makes this extremely predictable.\n\n6. Consider score: I'm at +8 total points and should continue exploiting this reliable pattern.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat the predictable paper choice as opponent continues their established 3-move cycle.\n\n[move] rock"
