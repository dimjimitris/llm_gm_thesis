      "reasoning_text": "Let me think about this step by step.\n\nSteps to consider for winning:\n\n1. I need to understand the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent) \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Same moves = tie (0 points for both)\n\n2. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new or inexperienced.\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, I need to make a strategic choice.\n\n4. In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently \"best\" move since it's a zero-sum game with perfect balance. However, there are some psychological tendencies:\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock first (it's often the first thing people think of)\n   - Some people choose scissors because it feels more \"aggressive\"\n   - Paper is sometimes chosen less frequently\n\n5. Given that my opponent is described as \"fresh,\" they might go with rock as it's a common first choice for new players.\n\n6. If I expect them to choose rock, I should choose paper to beat it.\n\n7. However, I should also consider that this could be a mind game where they expect me to think they'll choose rock.\n\n8. Since I have no other information to go on, I'll go with the statistical tendency that new players often choose rock first, so I'll choose paper.\n\nFinal decision: Paper",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
