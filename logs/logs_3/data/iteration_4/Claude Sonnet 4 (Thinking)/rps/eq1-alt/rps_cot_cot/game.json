This would bring my score back to 1 point.\n\nWait, let me double check the rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock.
