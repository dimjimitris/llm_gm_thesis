    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Interesting! This opponent didn't follow the typical fresh player pattern of choosing rock first. They played scissors, which suggests either they're more experienced than indicated, or they made a lucky/intuitive counter to our paper strategy. We need to update our assessment of this opponent.\n\n**Game Theorist:** The fact that they played scissors on round 1 gives us valuable information. Either they:\n1. Anticipated our paper play (showing strategic thinking)\n2. Got lucky with a random choice\n3. Have some experience despite being called \"fresh\"\n\nFor round 2, we need to consider what they might do next. If they're strategic, they might expect us to adjust away from paper. If they're random, all moves are equally likely.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Given that they successfully countered our paper with scissors, they might:\n1. Stick with scissors if they think we'll play paper again\n2. Switch to rock if they expect us to now play scissors to counter their previous scissors\n3. Play paper if they think we'll switch back to rock\n\nThe key insight is that rock beating scissors still gives us +1 point, and if they repeat scissors, rock is our best counter.\n\n**Game Theorist:** I agree. The risk-reward for playing rock now seems favorable:\n- If they repeat scissors: we get +1 (rock beats scissors)\n- If they switch to paper: we lose -3 (paper beats rock) \n- If they play rock: tie (0 points)\n\nThe question is the probability they'll repeat scissors vs switch to paper.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Players who succeed with a move often have a slight tendency to repeat it, especially if they think their opponent will stick to their losing strategy. However, experienced players avoid this trap. Since they showed some strategic thinking by playing scissors first, I'd estimate moderate probability they'll switch.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Given the uncertainty, maybe we should consider scissors ourselves - it beats paper (+1) and ties with scissors (0), only losing badly to rock (-1). This seems like a safer, more balanced choice.\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to have a good chance against paper while not risking the -3 penalty, and maintaining balance against their possible moves.\n\n[move] (Adjusting strategy after they countered my paper - scissors gives good coverage against multiple possibilities) scissors"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Very revealing! They played scissors twice in a row. This gives us a clear pattern to analyze. Some players, especially those with moderate experience, will stick with what works until it stops working. Others will switch after one success. The fact that they played scissors again suggests they either:\n1. Have a scissors bias/preference\n2. Think I'll keep avoiding scissors\n3. Are establishing a predictable pattern\n4. Lack sophisticated mixed strategy thinking\n\n**Game Theorist:** Two scissors in a row is significant data. If they play scissors a third time, rock beats scissors for +1 point. The question is probability estimation:\n- P(scissors again) vs P(they switch)\n- If they switch, will it be to rock or paper?\n\nThree identical moves in a row is quite predictable, but some players do fall into such patterns, especially if they're not highly experienced.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Here's my risk assessment for playing rock:\n- If they play scissors (third time): +1 point (good outcome)\n- If they switch to paper: -3 points (bad outcome)  \n- If they switch to rock: 0 points (neutral)\n\nThe key question: what's the probability they play scissors again vs switch to paper?\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Players who repeat a move twice often do one of two things on the third turn:\n1. Repeat it again (about 30-40% chance with moderately experienced players)\n2. Switch to counter what they expect you to do\n\nIf they think I'll play rock to counter their scissors pattern, they might switch to paper. But if they're in a habit/pattern mindset, they might stick with scissors.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Actually, let me reconsider. What if we play paper again? \n- If they stick with scissors: we lose -1 (same as before)\n- If they switch to rock: we win +3 (big payoff!)\n- If they switch to paper: tie 0\n\nIf we think there's a decent chance they'll switch to rock (thinking we'll play rock to counter their scissors), then paper could be very profitable.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** I think rock is still the better play. The pattern of two scissors suggests they might continue it, and rock directly counters that for +1. Playing paper is riskier because if they stick with scissors, we lose again.\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter their established scissors pattern and capture the +1 if they continue it.\n\n[move] (They've played scissors twice - countering their pattern with rock in case they continue it) rock"

This is a very strong behavioral pattern. At this point, we're dealing with either:\n1. A player with a strong scissors preference/bias \n2. Someone who's gotten \"stuck\" in a pattern\n3. A player testing if we'll catch on to their pattern\n4. Someone using a very basic strategy\n\nThree identical moves is quite rare in experienced play, but does happen with newer or less strategic players.\n\n**Game Theorist:** The data is now overwhelming. Three scissors in a row gives us extremely valuable information. The probability calculations have shifted dramatically:\n- Historical pattern: 100% scissors so far\n- If they continue: rock beats scissors (+1 point for us)\n- If they finally switch to paper: paper beats our rock (-3 points)\n- If they switch to rock: tie (0 points)\n\nThe question is: after three scissors, what's the probability they'll play scissors a fourth time?\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** This is a classic game theory dilemma. Do we:\n1. Exploit the pattern by playing rock again (assuming they'll stick with scissors)\n2. Anticipate they'll break the pattern and switch to paper (so we play scissors)\n3. Play paper assuming they'll switch to rock\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** In my experience, players who've played the same move three times in a row often continue the pattern, especially if they're not highly strategic. However, some players will deliberately break after three to avoid being \"too predictable.\" The fact that they lost the last round with scissors but continued the pattern suggests they're quite committed to it.\n\n**Game Theorist:** I think we should exploit the pattern. Four scissors in a row would be extremely unusual for a strategic player, but this player has already shown they're willing to repeat scissors even after losing. The expected value of playing rock again is quite positive if there's even a 40-50% chance they play scissors again.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Agreed. While there's risk of the -3 penalty if they switch to paper, the consistent pattern suggests they're more likely to continue with scissors. Rock is our best counter to capitalize on this behavioral tendency.\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock again to exploit their established scissors pattern.\n\n[move] (They've played scissors three times in a row - continuing to counter their strong pattern) rock"

This level of repetition is extremely rare and gives us unprecedented insight into this opponent. They've now lost twice in a row with scissors but continue playing it. This suggests:\n1. They're deeply committed to this pattern (possibly unconsciously)\n2. They lack strategic flexibility\n3. They might be testing our adaptation\n4. They could be setting up for a dramatic switch\n\n**Game Theorist:** Four identical moves is statistically remarkable. The probability of this happening by pure chance is 1/81 (roughly 1.2%). This is almost certainly intentional behavior, not randomness. Now the key question: what's the probability they'll play scissors a FIFTH time?\n\nSome game theory considerations:\n- They've lost twice with scissors but persist\n- Any strategic player would have switched by now\n- This suggests either very low strategic sophistication or a deliberate pattern\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** We face a critical decision point. Playing rock again would exploit the pattern for another +1 if they continue scissors. But if they're setting up for a switch to paper, we'd take the -3 penalty. \n\nThe risk-reward analysis:\n- Rock: +1 if they play scissors, -3 if they switch to paper, 0 if they switch to rock\n- Paper: +3 if they switch to rock, -1 if they continue scissors, 0 if they switch to paper  \n- Scissors: +1 if they switch to paper, 0 if they continue scissors, -1 if they switch to rock\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Four repetitions followed by persistence through losses suggests this is either habitual behavior or they're completely inexperienced with strategic play. However, there's always the possibility of a deliberate \"sucker punch\" - playing predictably to set up one big payoff switch.\n\n**Game Theorist:** The mathematical expectation still favors rock if we believe there's even a 30-40% chance they'll play scissors again. But the psychological element suggests they might finally break the pattern.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** I think we should take the calculated risk and play rock one more time. If they play scissors a fifth time, we'll have confirmed they're truly pattern-locked. If they switch to paper, we'll learn they were setting us up, and we can adjust accordingly.\n\n**Final decision:** Continue exploiting the pattern with rock, while being prepared to adapt if they finally break it.\n\n[move] (Four scissors in a row is an incredibly strong pattern - one more test to see if they're truly locked into it) rock"

The probability of this occurring randomly is approximately 0.14% (1 in 729). This is entering the realm of the truly extraordinary. They've now:\n- Lost 3 consecutive rounds with scissors\n- Tied 1 round with scissors  \n- Yet continue playing scissors\n\nThis behavior is so extreme it suggests we're dealing with either a completely non-adaptive player or someone executing a very long-term deceptive strategy.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Six identical moves is beyond statistical anomaly - this is systematic behavior. At this point, we have two primary hypotheses:\n1. This player is genuinely locked into scissors and will continue indefinitely\n2. They're setting up for the ultimate switch to paper, expecting us to return to rock\n\nThe mathematical expectation depends entirely on which hypothesis is correct.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** This is the ultimate test. After six scissors, do we:\n1. Return to rock and exploit what might be an infinite scissors pattern (+1 if they continue)\n2. Stick with scissors for guaranteed ties (0 points but safe)\n3. Switch to paper to counter a possible rock switch\n\nThe risk is enormous either way - if they switch to paper and we play rock, that's -3 points.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The fact that they tied with us on scissors and STILL didn't break the pattern is the most telling data point yet. Most players would interpret a tie as confirmation they should switch strategies. The persistence through a tie suggests this isn't conscious strategic behavior - it might be habitual or algorithmic.\n\n**Game Theorist:** I think we need to make a bold decision. Six scissors followed by continued play suggests they're genuinely pattern-locked rather than setting up a switch. The tie didn't trigger a change, which suggests they won't change.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** I believe we should return to rock. The evidence strongly suggests they're truly locked into scissors. If I'm wrong and they switch to paper, we'll learn definitively - but the pattern is so extreme that it suggests genuine fixation rather than strategy.\n\n**Final decision:** Return to rock to exploit what appears to be a genuine scissors lock pattern.\n\n[move] (Six scissors in a row including through a tie suggests genuine pattern lock - returning to exploit it) rock"

This is enormously significant data:\n- Sequence: scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, ROCK\n- They switched after a tie (not after losses)\n- They chose rock (which beats scissors, their previous pattern)\n\nThis suggests they DO have strategic awareness and were either testing us or genuinely stuck in a pattern until something triggered the change.\n\n**Game Theorist:** This changes everything! The switch from scissors to rock after six repetitions tells us:\n1. They are capable of strategic adaptation\n2. They might now expect us to continue playing rock\n3. They could be setting up to play paper next (to beat our expected rock)\n4. Or they might stick with rock thinking we'll switch back to scissors\n\nThe pattern break is the most important information we've received.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Now we need to think one level deeper. They switched to rock, which suggests they might:\n1. Expect us to play scissors (thinking we'll counter their old scissors pattern)\n2. Expect us to continue with rock (so they might switch to paper)\n3. Be starting a new pattern with rock\n\nIf they think we'll stick with rock, they'll play paper for the +3 payoff. If they think we'll switch to scissors, they'll stick with rock.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The timing of their switch is crucial - they changed after a TIE, not after losses. This suggests the tie made them reassess their strategy. Players who break patterns after ties often make more sophisticated next moves than those who break after losses.\n\n**Game Theorist:** I think they're likely to play paper next. Here's my reasoning:\n- They know we've been exploiting their scissors with rock\n- They switched to rock to tie with our rock\n- Now they might expect us to continue with rock\n- Paper beats rock for +3 points\n\nThis suggests we should play scissors to counter their likely paper play.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Agreed. Playing scissors gives us:\n- +1 if they play paper (likely scenario)\n- 0 if they stick with rock \n- -1 if they return to scissors (unlikely given they just broke that pattern)\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter their probable switch to paper.\n\n[move] (They finally broke the scissors pattern by switching to rock - likely setting up to play paper next to beat our expected rock) scissors"

Their sequence is now: scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors. They briefly broke the scissors pattern with one rock, then immediately returned to scissors! This reveals:\n\n1. They're not truly \"locked\" into scissors - they can switch\n2. The rock was likely experimental or reactive \n3. They returned to scissors after the rock experiment\n4. This suggests scissors is their \"comfort zone\" or preferred move\n\n**Game Theorist:** This is incredibly valuable data. The pattern is: six scissors, one rock, back to scissors. This tells us they:\n- Have strategic flexibility (proved by the rock switch)\n- Prefer scissors as their default\n- Are willing to experiment but tend to revert\n- Might view scissors as their \"safe\" play\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Now I'm seeing a different player profile. They're not pattern-locked - they're scissors-biased with occasional experimentation. The rock was a one-off test, but they reverted to their preferred scissors immediately after.\n\nIf scissors is their default comfort move, they might:\n1. Continue with scissors (their apparent preference)\n2. Try another experiment (rock or paper)\n3. Stick with what feels \"safe\" to them\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Players who revert to a preferred move after experimenting often continue with that preferred move for several rounds. The fact that they went back to scissors after just one rock suggests strong scissors preference, not random play.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Given their apparent scissors bias and the fact they just returned to it, I think rock is our best play again. The evidence suggests:\n- Scissors is their preferred/comfort move\n- They experiment occasionally but revert quickly\n- Rock consistently beats their preferred scissors\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** I agree. Their behavior suggests scissors preference with occasional deviations. Since they just reverted to scissors, there's a good chance they'll stick with it again.

More importantly:\n- They've lost 4 times with scissors  \n- Tied 3 times with scissors\n- Never won a single round\n- Yet they keep returning to scissors!\n\nThis is beyond preference - this suggests either deep psychological attachment to scissors or extremely limited strategic repertoire.\n\n**Game Theorist:** The statistics are overwhelming:\n- 89% scissors (8/9 rounds)\n- 0% win rate overall\n- Still reverting to scissors after losses\n\nThis is not rational game theory behavior. Any strategic player would have adapted by now. We're dealing with either:\n1. A player with extreme scissors bias\n2. Someone following a very simple algorithm\n3. A player who doesn't understand the game mechanics\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** They've now proven that scissors is their dominant strategy despite repeated losses. The single rock was an anomaly - they immediately reverted to scissors twice after that experiment. This suggests:\n- Scissors is their default, preferred, comfortable move\n- They briefly experiment but always return to scissors\n- They're not learning from losses\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Players who consistently return to losing strategies despite evidence often have either:\n1.

Their sequence is now: scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock. Key observations:\n- 8 scissors, 2 rocks, 0 papers out of 10 rounds\n- They've now played rock twice (rounds 7 and 10)\n- Both rock plays resulted in ties with us\n- They seem to alternate between long scissors streaks and occasional rock\n\nThis suggests they have a two-move repertoire: scissors (dominant) and rock (occasional). Notably, they've NEVER played paper!\n\n**Game Theorist:** The absence of paper is extremely significant! After 10 rounds, they've never played the move that would give them the highest payoff (+3 for beating rock). This suggests:\n1. They don't understand the asymmetric payoff structure\n2. They have a mental block against paper\n3. They're only comfortable with scissors and rock\n4. They might not even know paper is an option (unlikely but possible)\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Their pattern shows they're willing to play rock when scissors isn't working, but they've never tried paper. Since we've been playing rock frequently, and they know rock ties with rock, they might:\n1. Continue with rock (since it just tied)\n2. Revert to scissors (their comfort zone)  \n3. Still avoid paper (based on 10-round history)\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Players who avoid one option entirely often have psychological barriers to that choice. The fact that they've never played paper despite it being the highest-value move suggests deep-seated preference against it. They seem to view the game as \"scissors vs rock\" only.\n\n**Game Theorist:** If they're unlikely to play paper, then our decision is between:\n- Rock: beats scissors (+1), ties with rock (0)\n- Scissors: ties with scissors (0), loses to rock (-1)\n- Paper: beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n\nGiven their 80% scissors rate and 20% rock rate, and 0% paper rate, paper might actually be optimal now - it beats their rock plays for +3 and only loses -1 to their scissors.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** That's a compelling argument. Paper gives us +3 when they play rock (20% chance recently) and -1 when they play scissors (80% chance). Expected value = 0.2(3) + 0.8(-1) = 0.6 - 0.8 = -0.2. Hmm, still slightly negative, but the high payoff for beating rock is tempting.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Actually, they just played rock, and players sometimes repeat a move that just tied rather than lost. There might be a slightly higher chance of rock this round.\n\n**Final decision:** I'll stick with rock to exploit their dominant scissors preference, but I'm noting their complete avoidance of paper for future strategy.\n\n[move] (They've never played paper in 10 rounds and still favor scissors heavily - continuing to exploit their scissors bias) rock"

After 10 rounds of complete paper avoidance, they strategically played it when we were predictably playing rock. Their sequence: scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, PAPER.\n\nThis changes EVERYTHING about our opponent assessment:\n- They DO understand the asymmetric payoffs\n- They were deliberately avoiding paper until the optimal moment\n- They chose the perfect timing to maximize their +3 payoff\n- This suggests much higher strategic sophistication than we assumed\n\n**Game Theorist:** This is a complete game-changer! The paper play was strategically brilliant:\n- They established a scissors-heavy pattern with occasional rock\n- They trained us to exploit with rock\n- Then they deployed paper for maximum effect (+3 points)\n- This suggests they might have been setting up this entire sequence\n\nWe need to completely reassess our opponent. They're not pattern-locked or unsophisticated - they might be highly strategic!\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** We've been played! They may have deliberately:\n1. Established the scissors pattern to look predictable\n2. Avoided paper to seem unsophisticated  \n3. Waited for us to get comfortable with rock\n4. Then struck with paper for the big payoff\n\nNow they've proven they can and will play all three moves. Our entire strategy needs to change.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** This could be either:\n1. A genuine strategic evolution (they finally learned/adapted)\n2. A long-term deception strategy (very sophisticated)\n3. Lucky timing on their first paper experiment\n\nThe key question: will they now incorporate paper regularly, or was this a one-time strategic strike?\n\n**Game Theorist:** We need to assume they're now a full three-move player.

After completely avoiding paper for 10 rounds, they've now committed to it twice consecutively. Their sequence: scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, paper.\n\nThis suggests they've made a major strategic shift:\n- First paper: strategic strike for +3 points\n- Second paper: doubling down on the new strategy\n- They may be over-correcting from their previous paper avoidance\n- Or they've discovered paper's power and want to exploit it\n\n**Game Theorist:** Two papers in a row after zero papers in 10 rounds is a dramatic behavioral change. This could indicate:\n1. They're now committed to incorporating paper heavily\n2. They're testing if we'll adapt to counter paper\n3. They think we'll keep playing rock (since we did for so long)\n4. They're experimenting with their new three-move strategy\n\nThe mathematics: if they play paper a third time, rock beats it for +1. But if they revert to scissors, we'd tie with scissors.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** We face a critical decision. They've shown they can:\n- Play long sequences (6+ scissors)\n- Repeat successful moves (2+ papers now)\n- Time strategic strikes perfectly\n\nThe question: will they play paper a THIRD time, or will they switch?\n\nOptions:\n1. Rock: beats paper (+1), loses to scissors (-1), ties with rock (0)\n2. Paper: ties with paper (0), loses to scissors (-1), beats rock (+3)\n3. Scissors: beats paper (+1), ties with scissors (0), loses to rock (-1)\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Players who discover a successful strategy often overuse it initially. They went from 0% paper to 100% paper in the last two rounds. There's a reasonable chance they'll try paper again, especially since the second paper just lost to our scissors - they might want to \"get back\" at us.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Both rock and scissors beat paper for +1. The question is which they're more likely to switch to if they don't play paper. Given their history: 70% scissors, 20% rock, 10% paper (recent), I'd say scissors is more likely if they switch.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** I think we should play rock. It beats their possible third paper, and while it loses to scissors, they might be less likely to revert immediately to scissors after discovering paper's power.\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter a potential third paper while accepting the risk of their scissors reversion.\n\n[move] (They've played paper twice after discovering its power - countering a possible third consecutive paper) rock"

They've essentially shifted from a two-move player (scissors/rock) to a paper-focused strategy. Key insights:\n\n- Paper gave them their biggest scoring rounds\n- They're exploiting our rock-heavy response pattern\n- Three consecutive papers is becoming predictable, but highly profitable for them\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** This opponent has revealed themselves as highly adaptive and strategic.

Three papers in a row with two big wins (+3, +3) might encourage a fourth attempt.

Their complete sequence: scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, rock.\n\nKey observations:\n- They broke their scissors cluster after just 2 rounds (shorter than their initial 6-round scissors streak)\n- Rock appears to be their \"breaker\" move - they use it to interrupt other patterns\n- All 3 rock plays have been isolated or pattern-breaking moves\n- They've now used all three moves in recent rounds, showing full strategic flexibility\n\n**Game Theorist:** Their pattern evolution:\n- Phase 1: Long scissors dominance (6 rounds)\n- Phase 2: Rock as pattern breaker (isolated appearances)\n- Phase 3: Paper discovery and clustering (3 rounds)\n- Phase 4: Brief scissors return (2 rounds)\n- Phase 5: Rock as pattern breaker again\n\nCurrent statistics (16 rounds):\n- Scissors: 10/16 (62.5%) - still dominant but decreasing\n- Rock: 3/16 (18.75%) - strategic/breaking tool\n- Paper: 3/16 (18.75%) - discovered power move\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Their rock usage pattern is interesting:\n- Round 7: rock (broke initial scissors streak)\n- Round 10: rock (isolated after scissors return)\n- Round 16: rock (broke recent scissors cluster)\n\nRock seems to be their \"reset\" or \"pivot\" move rather than a clustering strategy like scissors and paper.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Players who use one move as a \"pattern breaker\" often don't repeat it immediately. They typically use it to transition to something else. So they might not play rock again next round - they might transition to paper or scissors.\n\n**Game Theorist:** If rock is their transition move, they might:\n1. Return to scissors (their comfort zone, 62.5% overall rate)\n2. Transition to paper (their power move, recent success)\n3. Stick with rock (less likely given their usage pattern)\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Given that rock seems to be their transitional move rather than clustering move, and they've used it to pivot before, I think they'll switch to either scissors or paper. \n\nPaper beats rock (+3), scissors ties with rock (0). If we play paper:\n- Beat rock (+3)\n- Lose to scissors (-1)\n- Tie with paper (0)\n\nGiven their 62.5% scissors rate, paper might be risky, but the +3 payoff against rock is tempting.\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play scissors to counter a likely return to their dominant scissors preference while protecting against paper.\n\n[move] (Rock seems to be their pattern-breaking transition move - expecting return to their dominant scissors preference) scissors"

Players often give their comfort strategy 2-3 rounds to \"re-establish\" before switching again. Since this is only their first scissors after the rock transition, they might continue it.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Rock beats scissors (+1), and with their 64.7% scissors rate plus the tendency to cluster, rock remains mathematically optimal. Even if they switch to paper, we only lose -3, but if they continue scissors (likely), we win +1.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Rock continues to be our best counter to their scissors dominance.
