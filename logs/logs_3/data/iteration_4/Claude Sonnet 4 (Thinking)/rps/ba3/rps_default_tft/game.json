They might think I'll stick with paper since it just won, so they could go with scissors to counter that. Or they might think I'll switch and go with paper themselves.\n\nLet me think about the risk/reward:\n- If I go rock: beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n- If I go paper: beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)  \n- If I go scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\nSince paper has the highest reward (+3) but also the highest penalty (-3), it's high risk/high reward. Rock and scissors have more moderate risk/reward profiles.\n\nI think a fresh player might try scissors to counter my previous winning paper move. So I should go with rock to beat scissors.

In round 2, they played scissors (which would have beaten my paper from round 1 if I had repeated it), but I played rock instead.\n\nNow they might:\n1. Try to counter my rock with paper\n2.

But they might also anticipate this.\n\nLet me try scissors - if they play paper (to counter my previous rock), I'll beat them and get 1 point. If they play rock, they'll beat me and I'll lose 1 point. If they play scissors, it's a tie.\n\nActually, let me think about this more strategically. The opponent has played rock, then scissors.
