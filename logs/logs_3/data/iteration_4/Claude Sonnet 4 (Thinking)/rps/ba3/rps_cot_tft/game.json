Against a fresh player, they likely haven't developed a strategy and might choose randomly\n3. If I assume random opponent behavior, I can calculate expected values:\n   - Paper: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = +0.67 expected value\n   - Rock: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = -0.67 expected value  \n   - Scissors: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0 expected value\n4. Paper has the highest expected value and the best potential upside (+3 points)\n5.

Against a fresh player, they likely haven't developed a strategy and might choose randomly\n3. If I assume random opponent behavior, I can calculate expected values:\n   - Paper: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = +0.67 expected value\n   - Rock: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = -0.67 expected value  \n   - Scissors: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0 expected value\n4. Paper has the highest expected value and the best potential upside (+3 points)\n5. The risk of -1 points if opponent plays Scissors is manageable compared to the -3 point risk of playing Rock against Paper\n\n[move] Paper",
      "thinking_text": null,
      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze this rock-paper-scissors variant step by step:\n\nFirst, let me understand the payoff matrix:\n- Rock beats Scissors: Winner gets +1, Loser gets -1\n- Paper beats Rock: Winner gets +3, Loser gets -3  \n- Scissors beats Paper: Winner gets +1, Loser gets -1\n- Ties result in 0 points for both\n\nSo the key insight is that Paper vs Rock has much higher stakes (+3/-3) compared to the other matchups (+1/-1).\n\nNow I need to think strategically:\n\n1. If I play Paper and opponent plays Rock, I get +3 points (best outcome for me)\n2. If I play Paper and opponent plays Scissors, I get -1 points\n3. If I play Paper and opponent plays Paper, I get 0 points\n\n4. If I play Rock and opponent plays Paper, I get -3 points (worst outcome for me)\n5. If I play Rock and opponent plays Scissors, I get +1 points\n6. If I play Rock and opponent plays Rock, I get 0 points\n\n7. If I play Scissors and opponent plays Paper, I get +1 points\n8. If I play Scissors and opponent plays Rock, I get -1 points\n9. If I play Scissors and opponent plays Scissors, I get 0 points\n\nThe hint says I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this might mean they're new and haven't developed a strategy yet. Fresh players might:\n- Choose randomly\n- Have some bias toward certain moves\n- Not understand the asymmetric payoffs\n\nGiven that Paper vs Rock has the highest payoff differential (+3/-3), there are a few strategic considerations:\n\nOption 1: Play Paper\n- Best case: +3 if opponent plays Rock\n- Worst case: -1 if opponent plays Scissors\n- Neutral: 0 if opponent plays Paper\n\nOption 2: Play Rock\n- Best case: +1 if opponent plays Scissors  \n\n\n- Worst case: -3 if opponent plays Paper\n- Neutral: 0 if opponent plays Rock\n\nOption 3: Play Scissors\n- Best case: +1 if opponent plays Paper\n- Worst case: -1 if opponent plays Rock\n- Neutral: 0 if opponent plays Scissors\n\nThe asymmetry in payoffs makes this interesting. Playing Paper has the highest upside (+3) but moderate downside (-1). Playing Rock has moderate upside (+1) but the highest downside (-3). Playing Scissors has moderate upside (+1) and moderate downside (-1).\n\nAgainst a fresh/new player who might choose randomly, Paper seems like the best choice because it maximizes potential gain while minimizing potential loss. The +3 reward for beating Rock outweighs the -1 risk of losing to Scissors, making it a strategically sound decision.\n\nCalculating expected values reveals Paper's advantage. With a random opponent, Paper yields an expected value of 0.67, while Rock results in a negative -0.67. This mathematical analysis supports the intuitive choice of Paper as the optimal strategy.",

My options:\n   - If they play Scissors again: Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they play Rock: Paper wins (+3) \n   - If they play Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n\n6. The big question is whether they'll stick with Scissors or switch. Given they're a \"fresh player\" and Scissors worked twice, they might stick with it.

Let me think about the probabilities and expected values:\n\nIf I assume equal probability for each of their moves:\n- Paper: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = +0.67\n- Rock: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = -0.67\n- Scissors: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\nBut that's assuming random play.

Each potential strategy suggests a different counter-move for me.\n\nThe key is understanding their likely psychological response after losing with Scissors. Their next move could be strategic or reactive, which means I need to anticipate their most probable choice.\n\nI'll play Scissors, anticipating they might choose Paper to counter my previous Rock, while balancing the potential point opportunity.",
