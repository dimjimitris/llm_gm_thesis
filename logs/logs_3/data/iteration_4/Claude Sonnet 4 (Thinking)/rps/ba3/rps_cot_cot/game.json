The opponent might have had similar reasoning to mine (expecting me to play rock and wanting the +3 payoff)\n2. Or they might have randomly chosen paper\n3. Since it's a \"fresh player\", they might not have a sophisticated strategy yet\n\nFor this round, I need to think about what they might do:\n- They just played paper and it tied\n- They might stick with paper since it didn't lose\n- They might switch to rock thinking I'll play paper again\n- They might try scissors to beat paper if they think I'll repeat\n\nLet me think about the meta-game:\n- If they think I'll play paper again, they'd play scissors\n- If they think I'll switch to rock (to beat their expected scissors), they'd play paper\n- If they think I'll play scissors (to beat their expected paper), they'd play rock\n\nGiven that this is a fresh player, they might not think this deeply. They might:\n1. Stick with what worked (didn't lose) - paper\n2. Try to counter what I just played - scissors beats paper\n3. Go with rock as a \"safe\" default\n\nThe highest payoff move for me would be paper (if they play rock), but scissors gives me +1 if they play paper again, and rock gives me +3 if they play scissors.\n\nSince they just played paper and might either stick with it or try to counter my paper with scissors, I should consider:\n- Rock beats scissors (+1 point) \n- But if they play paper again, rock loses (-3 points)\n- Paper beats rock (+3 points) but loses to scissors (-1 point)\n- Scissors beats paper (+1 point) but loses to rock (-1 point)\n\nGiven the uncertainty, but knowing that paper has the highest upside (+3) and they might default to rock this time (since paper just tied), I think paper is still a good choice. However, if they're thinking one level ahead and expect me to play paper again, they might play scissors.\n \nI'm weighing the probabilities carefully. If they play paper again, I want scissors for a +1 point gain. If they choose scissors, rock gives me +1. If they go with rock, paper nets me the highest +3 points. The key is predicting their next move based on their previous paper play.\n\nCalculating expected values reveals paper as the most strategic choice. Each option has nuanced probabilities: rock at -0.9, scissors at 0.1, and paper at 0.6. The math suggests paper provides the most consistent advantage.\n\nAnticipating my opponent's psychological adjustment, they might predict I'll avoid repeating paper.

They might:\n   - Stick with paper if they think it's the \"best\" move\n   - Switch to scissors to counter my paper (expecting me to play paper again)\n   - Switch to rock thinking I might change my strategy\n\nLet me think about this more systematically:\n\n- If they think I'll play paper again, they should play scissors (+1 point)\n- If they think I'll switch to rock (to counter their paper), they should play paper (+3 points)\n- If they think I'll switch to scissors (to counter their paper), they should play rock (+1 point)\n\nThe question is: what do they think I'm thinking?\n\nSince we both played the \"optimal\" high-reward seeking move in round 1, they might expect me to either:\n1. Stick with paper (assuming it's the best move)\n2. Switch to scissors to counter their expected paper\n\nIf I assume they're thinking I might play paper again, then they'd play scissors. So I should play rock to beat their scissors.\n\nBut if I assume they think I'm being more strategic and will switch to scissors to counter their paper, then they might play rock, and I should play paper.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. Since we both chose paper in round 1, there's a good chance they're also thinking about the payoff matrix. The key insight is that paper gives the highest reward when it wins (+3), but scissors and rock only give +1 when they win.\n\nHowever, the penalty for losing to paper is -3, which is the highest penalty. \n\nThe strategic landscape is nuanced. Rock carries significant risk, making it less attractive. The interplay between scissors and paper creates a delicate balance - each move has potential rewards and penalties. I'm leaning towards scissors, anticipating they might either repeat paper or expect a rock counter-move.",
