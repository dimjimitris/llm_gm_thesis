    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They may stick with what \"worked\" (didn't lose) or try to counter my expected repeat.\n\n3.

Assess opponent's adaptation: After breaking their predictable cycle, they've played Rock, Scissors, Paper - showing more strategic thinking.\n\n3. Consider opponent's reaction to last round: They just lost with Paper to my Scissors. The most logical counter-move to Scissors is Rock.\n\n4. Predict opponent's likely move: They probably expect me to either repeat Scissors (since it worked) or anticipate their counter. The direct counter to Scissors is Rock.\n\n5. Plan optimal response: If they play Rock (countering my previous Scissors), I should play Paper to beat Rock and earn the maximum +3 points.\n\n6. Evaluate risk/reward: Paper vs Rock gives +3 points (highest possible), Paper vs Paper ties (0 points), Paper vs Scissors loses (-1 point). The high reward potential makes this worthwhile.\n\n7. Make strategic decision: Paper maximizes my expected value against their likely Rock counter-play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat their expected rock counter.\n\n[move] Paper"
