The opponent chose scissors in the first round. I need to consider:\n\n1. Are they random?\n2. Are they following some pattern?\n3. Are they trying to counter what they think I'll do?\n\nSince it's only been one round, I don't have much information.

Stick with scissors\n2. Switch to rock (expecting me to play rock to counter scissors)\n3. Switch to paper\n\nGiven the high payoff for paper beating rock, and the possibility they might switch to rock thinking I'll counter their scissors with rock, I think paper might be a good choice again. But that's risky if they stick with scissors.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. Rock seems like a safe choice - if they play scissors again, I win 1 point. If they play rock, it's a tie. If they play paper, I lose 3 points, but that seems less likely right after they played scissors.\n\nI think I'll go with rock.",
