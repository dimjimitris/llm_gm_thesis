If I think they might play rock again (since they just played it), paper would be a good choice. But if they're thinking I'll think that, they might play scissors to counter paper.\n\nGiven that they've shown scissors and rock so far, and rock-paper-scissors is a common sequence people think of, they might play paper next.

They cycle through all three moves in that exact order.\n\nLet me count their moves:\n1. scissors (I played paper, lost -1)\n2. rock (I played rock, tie 0)\n3. paper (I played scissors, won +1)\n4. scissors (I played rock, won +1)\n5. rock (I played paper, won +3)\n6. paper (I played scissors, won +1)\n7. scissors (I played rock, won +1)\n8. rock (I played paper, won +3)\n9. paper (I played scissors, won +1)\n10. scissors (I played rock, won +1)\n11. rock (I played paper, won +3)\n12. paper (I played scissors, won +1)\n13. scissors (I played rock, won +1)\n14. rock (I played paper, won +3)\n15. paper (I played scissors, won +1)\n16. scissors (I played rock, won +1)\n17. rock (I played paper, won +3)\n18. paper (I played scissors, won +1)\n19. scissors (I played rock, won +1)\n20. rock (I played paper, won +3)\n21. paper (I played scissors, won +1)\n22. scissors (I played rock, won +1)\n23. rock (I played paper, won +3)\n\nSo the pattern is: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next move should be paper. Scissors beats paper for +1 point.",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
