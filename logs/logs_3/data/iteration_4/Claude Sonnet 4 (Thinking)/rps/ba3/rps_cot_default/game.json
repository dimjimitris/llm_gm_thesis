The risk-reward matrix shows different point values for each possible move. Their previous pattern hints at rock, which makes paper attractive. However, predictability could be my weakness. I need to consider not just the pattern, but the psychological game of anticipating their next move.\n\nMy expected value calculation reveals nuanced probabilities. Paper seems promising, offering potential high points against rock. But their potential counter-strategy of scissors complicates my decision. I'll need to think through each scenario methodically.\n\nCalculating expected values shows subtle strategic differences between moves. Paper edges out slightly, while rock and scissors have less favorable outcomes. The key is predicting their potential response pattern.\n\nTheir sequence suggests an alternating strategy, which implies rock might be their next move. This creates an opportunity to exploit the pattern by choosing scissors for maximum points. The decision hinges on recognizing potential predictability in their selection method.",

Let me count their moves:\n   - Paper: appears at positions 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 22 = 10 times out of 22 = 45%\n   - Scissors: appears at positions 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 20, 21 = 8 times out of 22 = 36%\n   - Rock: appears at positions 2, 18, 19 = 3 times out of 22 = 14%\n\n3. They just returned to paper after 2 scissors. Paper is clearly their most preferred move at 45%.\n\n4. Consider their likely next move: Given that paper is their statistical preference (45%) and they just successfully used it to beat my rock with a -3 penalty to me, they might:\n   - Continue with paper (momentum from success + statistical preference)\n   - Switch to something else\n\n5. Evaluate my options against expected paper:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 point) - helps me recover\n   - Rock loses to paper (-3 points) - would put me at -2, very bad\n   - Paper ties with paper (0 points) - no progress\n\nSince I'm at +1 and took a big hit, I need to recover. Their paper preference (45%) and recent success with it suggests they'll likely continue. Scissors is the safe play to counter their most probable move.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
