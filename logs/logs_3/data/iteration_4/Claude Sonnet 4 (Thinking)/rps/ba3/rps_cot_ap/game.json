      "reasoning_text": "Let me think step-by-step about this rock-paper-scissors game.\n\nFirst, let me understand the payoff structure:\n- Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Ties give 0 points to both players\n\nSo the key insight is that paper beating rock gives much higher rewards/penalties (+3/-3) compared to the other winning combinations (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (which suggests they're new), I need to think about what they might choose:\n\n1. Fresh/new players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive first choice\n2. If they choose rock and I choose paper, I get +3 points\n3. If they choose paper and I choose scissors, I get +1 point\n4. If they choose scissors and I choose rock, I get +1 point\n\nGiven that paper vs rock gives the highest reward (+3), and new players often choose rock, paper seems like a strong strategic choice.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that if they don't choose rock:\n- If they choose paper, I lose 1 point with my paper choice (tie = 0 points)\n- If they choose scissors, I lose 1 point with my paper choice\n\nBut the potential upside (+3) outweighs the potential downside (-1), especially given the hint that this is a \"fresh player\" who might be more likely to choose rock.\n\nMy strategy: Choose paper to maximize expected value against a fresh player who is likely to choose rock.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
