Let me analyze:\n\n1. The opponent played scissors in the first round\n2. They're described as a \"fresh player\" but they didn't go with the typical \"rock\" first choice\n3. This could mean:\n   - They're actually thinking strategically \n   - They might have been anticipating that I would expect them to play rock\n   - Or it could just be random\n\nFor the second round, I need to consider:\n- If they stick with scissors, I should play rock (rock beats scissors, +1 point)\n- If they switch to rock (thinking I might play rock to counter their scissors), I should play paper (+3 points)\n- If they play paper, I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\nGiven that they showed some strategic thinking in round 1 by not going with the obvious \"rock\" choice, they might be thinking one level deeper. They might expect me to play rock to counter their scissors from last round.\n\nIf they think I'll play rock, they might play paper to get the big +3 point win.\nIf they play paper and I play scissors, I get +1 point.\n\nBut this could also be overthinking it. Maybe I should just go with rock since it directly counters what they played last round.\n\nActually, let me think about the payoff structure again:\n- Paper beats rock: +3/-3\n- Rock beats scissors: +1/-1  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1/-1\n\nThe asymmetric payoff makes paper vs rock the most important matchup. If I play rock and they play paper, I lose -3 points which is the worst outcome. If I play scissors and they play paper, I get +1 point.\n\nSo maybe I should avoid rock because of the potential -3 penalty, and either go with paper or scissors.\n\nBetween paper and scissors:\n\n\nI'm weighing the potential outcomes carefully. Paper offers a high reward if they play rock, but risks a medium penalty if they play scissors. Scissors provides a medium reward against paper but carries a high penalty if they choose rock. The strategic complexity is challenging my decision-making process.\n\nGiven their previous scissors play, I'm analyzing potential counter-strategies. A scissors choice could yield a +1 win against paper, result in a tie, or risk a -1 loss against rock. This seems more favorable than the -3 point potential loss from a rock play.\n\nI'm considering two primary opponent approaches: completely random selection or tendency to repeat their last move.
