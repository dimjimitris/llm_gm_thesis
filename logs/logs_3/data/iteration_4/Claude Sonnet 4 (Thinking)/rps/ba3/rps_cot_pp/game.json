      "reasoning_text": "I need to analyze this game step-by-step to determine my strategy.\n\nLet me first understand the payoff structure:\n- Rock beats Scissors: Winner gets +1, Loser gets -1\n- Paper beats Rock: Winner gets +3, Loser gets -3  \n- Scissors beats Paper: Winner gets +1, Loser gets -1\n- Tie: Both get 0\n\nSo the payoff matrix looks like:\n- If I play Rock: I win +1 vs Scissors, lose -3 vs Paper, tie 0 vs Rock\n- If I play Paper: I win +3 vs Rock, lose -1 vs Scissors, tie 0 vs Paper  \n- If I play Scissors: I win +1 vs Paper, lose -1 vs Rock, tie 0 vs Scissors\n\nKey observations:\n1. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3)\n2. Rock and Scissors have lower rewards (+1) but also lower losses (-1)\n3. The opponent is described as a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new and potentially predictable\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- Since this is against a \"fresh player\", they might have predictable patterns\n- Many beginners tend to start with Rock as it's the first option mentioned\n- Paper gives the biggest reward if I'm right about them choosing Rock\n- But if they choose Scissors, I lose 1 point with Paper\n\nGiven that this is the first round against a fresh player, and many people intuitively start with Rock, I think Paper is a good strategic choice. The potential +3 reward outweighs the -1 risk, especially if fresh players tend to choose Rock.\n\nLet me make my move.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
