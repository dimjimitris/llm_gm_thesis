But if they're thinking one level ahead, they might switch to paper to beat my expected rock.\n\nLet me think about the payoff matrix again:\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 points\n- Paper beats rock: +3 points  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1 points\n\nSince paper gives the highest reward (+3), it's tempting to play it often. But if the opponent catches onto this pattern, they'll play scissors.\n\nFor this round, I think I'll go with rock.

Many players avoid repeating a losing move. Rock seems like a natural counter-choice for them since they just lost to rock. If they think I'll stick with rock since it worked, they might play paper to beat my rock.\n\nBut this is getting into meta-thinking.

The opponent tends to stick with one move for multiple rounds before switching. After their scissors streak, paper streak, and rock streak, they might be preparing to change again. \n\nI'll anticipate their next move by watching for another potential streak. My strategy will depend on their choice, ready to counter with the winning move.\n\nTheir recent successful scissors play suggests they might feel confident continuing with that strategy. I'll prepare my rock to counter their potential scissors.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
