Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - new players often choose rock as their first move since it's commonly seen as the default or \"strong\" choice\n\n4.

      "reasoning_text": "Analyzing the current game state:\n\n1. Current score: +21 points after 23 rounds (incredible performance!)\n\n2. The opponent's reactive pattern continues to be extremely predictable:\n   - When I win with paper \u2192 they counter with scissors\n   - When I win with rock \u2192 they counter with paper\n   - When I win with scissors \u2192 they counter with rock\n\n3. I just won with rock, so following their established reactive psychology, they should play paper to counter it.\n\n4. This pattern has been incredibly consistent and profitable for me to exploit. They seem unable to break out of this reactive mindset despite it consistently losing them points.\n\n5. If they play paper (very likely based on pattern): scissors wins (+1)\n   If they play rock: scissors loses (-1)\n   If they play scissors: scissors ties (0)\n\n6. Paper is the most probable choice based on their reactive counter-strategy.\n\n7. Scissors gives me the win against their expected reactive move.",
