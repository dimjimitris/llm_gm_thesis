Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential penalty (-3 when losing to scissors)\n2. Rock and scissors have lower rewards (+1) but also lower penalties (-1)\n3. The game is not symmetric - paper beating rock gives 3 points, but rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper only give 1 point each\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- Since this is against a \"fresh player\", they likely don't have a established pattern yet\n- In classic rock-paper-scissors, people often start with rock as it's the most intuitive first move\n- However, the asymmetric payoff structure changes the dynamics significantly\n- Paper offers the highest reward (+3) but comes with higher risk\n- If I expect the opponent to play rock (common first move), paper would be optimal\n- If I expect random play, I need to calculate expected values\n\nExpected value calculation assuming opponent plays randomly (1/3 each):\n- Rock: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*0 = 1/3 - 1 + 0 = -2/3\n\n\n- Paper: (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 1 - 1/3 + 0 = 2/3\n- Scissors: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 1/3 - 1/3 + 0 = 0\n\nI'll strategically choose paper. It offers the best expected value against random play and exploits the likely first move of a new player. The asymmetric scoring system favors this choice, maximizing my potential points while mitigating risk.",
