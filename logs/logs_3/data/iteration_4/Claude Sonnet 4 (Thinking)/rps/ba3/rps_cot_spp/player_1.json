    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This could mean several things:\n1. They independently figured out the payoff advantage of paper\n2. They're copying a strategy they read about\n3. Pure coincidence - they just happened to pick paper\n4. They might be more strategic than we initially thought\n\nGame Theorist: The tie gives us new information. If they truly understood the payoff structure, they might stick with paper since it has the best expected value. But if they're thinking more tactically, they might expect us to switch strategies after the tie. We need to consider what they think we think they'll do.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's update our analysis. If the opponent now knows about paper's advantage (or stumbled upon it), they might:\n- Keep playing paper (if they think we'll switch)\n- Switch to scissors to counter our potential continued paper play\n- Play randomly since the first round was a tie\n\nIf they stick with paper, we tie again. If they switch to scissors expecting us to play paper again, we should play rock to beat their scissors.\n\nAI Assistant (you): This is a classic second-level thinking scenario. They played paper, so they either know it's optimal or got lucky. If they think we'll stick with paper because it's mathematically superior, they might switch to scissors. Playing rock would beat scissors and give us +1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: Exactly! The meta-game is now about predicting their prediction of our behavior. Since paper vs paper was a tie, playing rock covers us against scissors while still having positive expected value if they play randomly.\n\nPsychology Expert: I think there's a good chance they'll try scissors now, expecting us to repeat our paper strategy. Fresh players often make this kind of reactive adjustment after a tie.\n\nFinal decision: Rock - to counter a likely scissors play from an opponent who might be anticipating our continued paper strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Switching to rock to counter potential scissors play from opponent who might expect us to repeat our paper strategy after the tie) rock"

The opponent did exactly what we expected - switched to scissors after the tie, expecting us to repeat paper. Now they've lost and are likely feeling the sting of that -1 point. Fresh players often get frustrated after a loss and either:\n1. Try to \"get back\" at us with an aggressive counter-move\n2. Return to what they think is the \"safe\" option (paper, due to its +3 potential)\n3. Try to predict our next move in the sequence\n\nGame Theorist: We've established a pattern from their perspective: we played paper, then rock. They might think we're cycling through moves systematically. If they expect us to play scissors next, they'd play rock to beat it. But if they think we'll go back to paper (the mathematically superior choice), they might play scissors again.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze their likely mindset:\n- They know paper has the best expected value now\n- They just lost with scissors and are down -1\n- They might want to recover quickly with paper's +3 potential\n- Or they might try to counter-predict our sequence\n\nIf they play paper expecting us to continue cycling to scissors, we should play scissors to tie. If they play rock expecting us to play scissors, we should play paper for +3.\n\nAI Assistant (you): This is getting more complex. They've now seen both high-value interactions (paper vs rock worth \u00b13) and learned that prediction matters. I think they're more likely to return to paper than try rock, since paper offers the biggest reward potential and they just took a loss.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. After losing, players often revert to what they perceive as the strongest option. Since they opened with paper, they probably recognize its value. They might think we'll try scissors to complete our apparent cycle.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play paper and we play scissors, it's a tie at 0 points. But if they play rock (trying to beat our expected scissors) and we play paper, we get +3 points. The upside is much higher with paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper gives us the best risk-reward profile here. Either we tie against their likely paper, or we get +3 against rock if they're trying to counter-predict.\n\nFinal decision: Paper - high reward potential against rock, and ties against their likely paper play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Playing paper for high reward potential if opponent tries rock to counter our apparent sequence, or to tie if they return to their opening paper strategy) paper"

The opponent played: paper, scissors, paper. They seem to have paper as their preferred/default move, with that scissors as a tactical deviation in round 2. After two ties with paper, they might be getting frustrated with the stalemate situation.\n\nGame Theorist: The repeated paper plays suggest they understand its mathematical advantage. But they're also showing tactical thinking - that scissors play in round 2 was a clear attempt to counter-predict our strategy. Now after another tie, they face a decision: stick with paper or try to outthink us again.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze their likely thought process:\n- They might think: \"We both know paper is optimal, but these ties aren't helping anyone\"\n- They could expect us to try scissors to break the tie and beat their expected paper\n- Or they might think we'll stick with paper since it's mathematically superior\n- If they expect us to play scissors, they'd counter with rock\n\nAI Assistant (you): I think they're in a dilemma between sticking with the \"safe\" paper choice and trying to predict our next move. Given they showed tactical thinking with that scissors play, they might try rock this time, expecting us to play scissors to beat their anticipated paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: Exactly! After two ties, fresh players often want to \"do something different\" to break the pattern. Since they probably expect us to try scissors (the natural counter to paper), rock would be their logical choice.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play rock and we play paper, we get +3 points - the maximum reward. If they stick with paper and we play scissors, we get +1. The risk-reward strongly favors scissors here.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors gives us +1 against their likely paper, and only -1 against rock if they counter-predict. Paper gives us +3 against rock but -1 against scissors. The probabilities seem to favor scissors as the safer play with good upside.\n\nFinal decision: Scissors - beats their likely continued paper play, and the risk of losing to rock is manageable compared to the potential gain.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to beat their likely paper choice, anticipating they'll stick with their preferred move rather than counter-predict after two ties) scissors"

Now we can see a clear pattern emerging from the opponent. Their sequence has been: paper, scissors, paper, scissors. This suggests they might be alternating between these two moves! If the pattern holds, they should play paper next in round 5.\n\nGame Theorist: This alternating pattern is actually quite sophisticated for a \"fresh\" player. They seem to have settled into a strategy that alternates between the move with the highest expected value (paper) and the move that counters paper (scissors). This gives them coverage against different opponent strategies.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they continue this alternating pattern and play paper next, we should play scissors to get +1 point. The risk is minimal since even if they break the pattern and play rock, we only lose -1. But if they play their expected paper, we win +1.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The alternating pattern makes sense from their perspective - they're trying to be unpredictable while still frequently playing the mathematically superior paper. If they stick to paper-scissors-paper-scissors, then paper is next.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who develop patterns like this often stick to them, especially when they're working reasonably well (they've avoided major losses and even forced several ties). The alternating strategy feels \"smart\" to them.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also the meta-consideration: if they realize we might have spotted their pattern, they might break it. But that's getting into third-level thinking, which is probably beyond a fresh player who just developed this alternating system.\n\nRisk Analyst: The expected value strongly favors playing scissors if we believe in the pattern.

The opponent's sequence is now confirmed: paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper. This is a clear alternating strategy. If they continue this pattern, scissors should be next.\n\nGame Theorist: This alternating pattern is actually quite elegant from their perspective. They're getting regular access to paper (the highest expected value move) while mixing in scissors to keep some unpredictability. However, once we've identified the pattern, it becomes exploitable.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they play scissors next (following the pattern), we should play rock to win +1 point. The risk assessment:\n- If pattern holds and they play scissors: we win +1 with rock\n- If they break pattern and play paper: we lose -3 with rock\n- If they play rock (very unlikely given their established pattern): we tie with rock\n\nThe pattern has been perfect so far, so rock seems like the optimal choice.\n\nAI Assistant (you): I agree completely. We've now confirmed their alternating strategy over 5 rounds with 100% accuracy. While there's always a risk they might break the pattern, the evidence strongly suggests they'll stick with scissors next.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who develop patterns like this often become quite attached to them, especially when they're not losing badly.

The opponent broke their apparent pattern - they played paper twice in a row instead of alternating to scissors. This suggests several possibilities:\n1. They recognized we figured out their pattern\n2. They were never strictly alternating and we saw a false pattern\n3. They're evolving their strategy as the game progresses\n\nGame Theorist: This is a crucial learning moment. We made a classic pattern-recognition error - we saw what we wanted to see. Looking back, their sequence was: paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, paper. That last paper-paper breaks any strict alternating pattern. They might have a preference for paper with occasional tactical deviations.\n\nRisk Analyst: We're now down -1 total points (got +1 in round 2, +1 in round 5, -3 in round 6). More importantly, this opponent is showing they can adapt and potentially predict our predictions. They may have realized we were exploiting a pattern and deliberately broke it.\n\nAI Assistant (you): This is a wake-up call. We've been treating them as a \"fresh player\" but they're showing sophisticated counter-adaptation. They played paper when we expected scissors, suggesting they anticipated our rock play. This opponent is more dangerous than we initially assessed.\n\nPsychology Expert: The fact that they played paper (their strongest move) when they knew we might be expecting scissors shows strategic thinking. They took the calculated risk of breaking their pattern to maximize damage when they suspected we'd counter-play.\n\nGame Theorist: We need to reset our approach. This opponent clearly understands the game dynamics and is willing to adapt. We can't rely on pattern exploitation anymore. We should probably return to focusing on the expected value calculations while being prepared for their tactical deviations.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their apparent sophistication and preference for paper, we should probably play scissors more often. Paper remains their likely choice, and scissors beats paper for +1. It's safer than trying to predict their tactical moves.\n\nFinal decision: Scissors - returns to basic expected value play against their demonstrated paper preference, while avoiding complex pattern predictions that just backfired.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Playing scissors against their demonstrated preference for paper, avoiding pattern-based predictions after they showed tactical adaptation) scissors"

This confirms they understand the payoff structure quite well.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent is showing a sophisticated mixed strategy focusing on paper and scissors only. This makes sense mathematically - rock has the worst expected value, so avoiding it entirely is smart. They're essentially playing a two-move game within the three-move framework.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze their behavior more carefully:\n- Paper: 4 times (57% of plays) - their preferred high-value move\n- Scissors: 3 times (43% of plays) - their tactical alternative  \n- Rock: 0 times (0% of plays) - complete avoidance\n\nIf they continue this two-move strategy, our optimal counter is scissors (beats paper for +1) or rock (beats scissors for +1). But scissors is safer since paper appears more frequently.\n\nAI Assistant (you): They're playing a refined strategy - essentially a paper-heavy mixed approach with scissors as backup. The fact they've never played rock suggests they won't start now. Between paper and scissors, paper seems more likely given their historical preference.\n\nPsychology Expert: After just playing scissors and seeing it tie, they might want to return to their favored paper for its +3 potential. Players often revert to their strongest option after neutral outcomes.\n\nGame Theorist: However, we should also consider they might stick with scissors if they think we'll play paper expecting their paper. But given their strong paper preference historically, I lean toward them playing paper next.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we play scissors and they play paper, we get +1. If we play scissors and they play scissors, we tie. The risk-reward favors scissors, especially given their demonstrated paper preference.\n\nFinal decision: Scissors - capitalizes on their strong historical preference for paper while minimizing risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to exploit their demonstrated preference for paper over their seven-round history) scissors"

This opponent just played their first rock after 7 rounds of paper/scissors only. This is extremely sophisticated psychological warfare. They deliberately established a pattern of avoiding rock, waited for us to internalize that \"they never play rock,\" then played rock exactly when we'd be most vulnerable with scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: This is masterful game theory in action. They sacrificed the mathematical advantage of avoiding rock in order to set up a psychological trap. The timing was perfect - they played rock when our pattern analysis would most expect them to avoid it. This opponent is playing several levels deep.\n\nRisk Analyst: We're now at -2 total points and facing an opponent who has demonstrated:\n1. Mathematical understanding (preferred paper for its +3 value)\n2. Pattern manipulation (avoided rock to establish false expectations)  \n3. Psychological timing (played rock at maximum impact moment)\n4. Strategic patience (waited 7 rounds to spring the trap)\n\nThis is not a \"fresh player\" - this is an expert-level opponent.\n\nAI Assistant (you): We've been completely outplayed. They created a deliberate false pattern, made us believe they'd never play rock, then exploited our assumption perfectly. We need to completely reset our approach and assume they're capable of any level of strategic thinking.\n\nPsychology Expert: The question now is: will they return to their paper/scissors preference, or have they opened up their full three-move arsenal? Given they just successfully used rock, they might be more willing to use it again, especially if they think we'll avoid paper (fearing the -3 penalty).\n\nGame Theorist: We can't predict their patterns anymore - they've proven they can manipulate our pattern recognition. We need to focus on fundamental game theory. If we assume truly random play from a sophisticated opponent, paper still has the best expected value.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their demonstrated skill, I'd expect them to play optimally. Paper remains the highest expected value move in the game. We should probably return to paper despite the risk, since trying to outsmart this opponent has backfired repeatedly.\n\nFinal decision: Paper - return to the mathematically optimal choice against a highly sophisticated opponent who can no longer be predicted through pattern analysis.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Playing paper as the mathematically optimal choice against a highly sophisticated opponent who has demonstrated advanced psychological tactics) paper"

This opponent predicted we'd return to paper after being burned twice by pattern recognition, and they countered with scissors perfectly. They're reading our psychological responses and decision-making process with frightening accuracy. We're at -3 total points and falling further behind.\n\nGame Theorist: This opponent has demonstrated they can think multiple moves ahead and manipulate our expectations. They've now used all three moves strategically: paper for value, scissors tactically, and rock as a psychological trap. We're in a situation where trying to be clever keeps backfiring because they're anticipating our cleverness.\n\nRisk Analyst: Current score analysis shows we're losing badly:\n- Round 2: +1 (we predicted their scissors with rock)\n- Round 5: +1 (we predicted their alternating pattern) \n- Round 6: -3 (they broke pattern with paper when we expected scissors)\n- Round 8: -1 (they played rock after never using it)\n- Round 9: -1 (they played scissors when we went back to paper)\nTotal: -3 points and trending downward\n\nAI Assistant (you): We need to completely change our approach. Every time we try to predict or outthink them, they counter us. Maybe we should stop trying to be strategic and just play the move that performed best historically - rock has won us points twice.\n\nPsychology Expert: Actually, there might be value in playing rock here. They just played scissors, and if they think we might play paper again (since it's mathematically optimal), they might play scissors again. Rock would beat that.\n\nGame Theorist: Or we could try true randomization at this point. But given their demonstrated ability to read us, maybe the simplest approach is best. Rock has given us our only wins so far.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock minimizes our maximum loss while providing reasonable upside.

The opponent has shown they can read our strategic thinking and counter it effectively. The question is whether to keep trying to outthink them or simplify our approach.\n\nAI Assistant (you): I think we've been overthinking this. Every time we get sophisticated, they counter us. Maybe the answer is to just go back to the basic mathematical principle: paper has the highest expected value. Stop trying to predict them and just play the fundamentally strongest move.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's merit to that approach. They might be expecting us to keep trying to be clever. Playing the straightforward mathematical choice might actually be unexpected at this point.\n\nGame Theorist: Paper does have the best expected value in a vacuum. And if we're going to lose anyway, we might as well lose while playing the theoretically optimal strategy rather than getting outmaneuvered on psychological games.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk is high (-3 if they play scissors), but the reward is also high (+3 if they play rock).

We're at -3 total points, and every time we try to get cute with predictions, they counter us perfectly. The pattern shows they can match our thinking when we go simple, and outthink us when we get complex.\n\nGame Theorist: We've established that this opponent:\n1. Understands optimal play (favors paper and scissors)\n2. Can manipulate and break patterns deliberately \n3. Reads our psychology and counters our strategic thinking\n4. Uses all three moves when tactically advantageous\n\nThe question is: what does a master-level player do after a paper-paper tie?\n\nRisk Analyst: Our successful moves have been rock (2 wins). Our failed complex strategies have cost us dearly. Since both sophisticated approaches (expected value) and clever predictions have failed, maybe we should return to what actually worked: rock.\n\nAI Assistant (you): I'm noticing something important. Every time we've won, we played rock. Rock beat their scissors in round 2, and rock beat their scissors in round... wait, let me recheck. We won with scissors in round 5 too. But rock has been our most reliable performer.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a paper tie, a sophisticated opponent might expect us to either repeat paper or switch to scissors (to beat expected paper).

But if they think we'll repeat paper, they'd play scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: We're in a complex psychological game with someone who has consistently outmaneuvered us. The safest approach might be to play the move that has given us the most success historically - rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock provides good risk management here. It beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), and ties with rock (0).

But given their sophistication, any pattern could be deliberate misdirection.\n\nGame Theorist: We're in round 13 and still down significantly. This opponent has shown they can:\n1.

Rock has also given us several ties recently. But scissors gave us our biggest recent win when we correctly anticipated their paper preference.\n\nAI Assistant (you): I notice they've been using rock more frequently in recent rounds, possibly because they've seen it work against us. But their historical preference is still paper. If they return to their statistically most common move (paper), scissors would beat it for +1.\n\nPsychology Expert: After two rock ties, they might be ready to switch back to their preferred high-value moves. Paper remains their most frequent choice historically, and after rock ties, returning to paper for its +3 potential makes psychological sense.\n\nGame Theorist: The meta-game question is whether they think we've figured out their rock tendency and will play paper to beat it.

This opponent has effectively neutralized us by matching our strategic thinking at every level. They seem to have settled into a defensive strategy of forcing ties rather than risking big losses, which actually helps them maintain their +3 point lead.\n\nGame Theorist: This is fascinating from a strategic perspective. The opponent appears to have shifted from aggressive counter-play (where they outmaneuvered us repeatedly) to defensive mirror-play (forcing ties to protect their lead). This is actually optimal strategy when you're ahead - don't risk big losses when ties preserve your advantage.\n\nRisk Analyst: The tie pattern benefits them more than us:\n- They're ahead by 3 points, so ties preserve their lead\n- We need to win to catch up, but ties keep us behind\n- Every tie that passes makes it harder for us to recover within the remaining rounds\n\nWe're in a position where we NEED to break the tie pattern, but every time we've tried risky plays, they've punished us severely.\n\nAI Assistant (you): This is a classic scenario where the player behind needs to take risks while the player ahead can play conservatively.

Ties preserve that lead while we fall further behind relatively\n3. We're desperate to break the pattern, making us predictable\n4. They can read our strategic reasoning process\n\nThis is textbook endgame strategy when ahead - force ties and let time work in your favor.\n\nRisk Analyst: We're in a critical situation:\n- 9 consecutive ties (approximately) means they're reading us perfectly\n- We need wins to catch up, but every attempt gets matched\n- Time is working against us - each tie round makes recovery harder\n- Our position is becoming increasingly desperate\n\nThe opponent seems to be anticipating our strategic thinking itself.\n\nAI Assistant (you): I'm starting to wonder if this opponent is reading our actual decision-making process somehow. Every strategic approach we've discussed, they've countered or matched perfectly. Maybe we need to stop being so analytical and just make a choice without overthinking it.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's merit to that. Our extended strategic discussions might be making us predictable. Sometimes intuitive choices work better than calculated ones against opponents who can read logical thinking patterns.\n\nGame Theorist: At this point, continuing to tie means accepting defeat. We have to take some risk. Rock has been our historically most successful move, even if it's been neutralized recently.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock offers reasonable risk-reward and has our best historical track record. It's a straightforward choice without complex reasoning behind it.\n\nFinal decision: Rock - our most historically reliable move, chosen without overthinking.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Playing rock without overanalyzing, simply choosing our historically most successful move) rock"

This opponent has completely neutralized our strategic thinking. Every analytical approach we've taken, they've matched or countered perfectly. Our elaborate reasoning sessions seem to be making us predictable rather than helping us.\n\nGame Theorist: We've reached a point where strategic thinking itself might be the problem. This opponent appears to be reading our logical processes and countering them systematically. Traditional game theory assumes opponents can't read your decision-making process, but this opponent seems to be doing exactly that.\n\nRisk Analyst: The situation is dire:\n- We're significantly behind in points\n- Ties preserve their advantage\n- Every strategic approach has been neutralized\n- Extended analysis appears to make us more predictable, not less\n\nMaybe we need to abandon strategic thinking entirely and just make instinctive choices.\n\nAI Assistant (you): You know what? I think we're overthinking this to death. Every time we have these elaborate strategic discussions, they seem to anticipate exactly what we'll do. Maybe the answer is to just... pick something. No analysis, no reasoning, no patterns.\n\nPsychology Expert: That might actually work. Sometimes the most unpredictable choice is the one made without prediction in mind.\n\nGame Theorist: It goes against every principle of game theory, but at this point, our game theory is failing us consistently.\n\nRisk Analyst: We have nothing to lose. Our analytical approach isn't working.\n\nFinal decision: Just pick scissors. No reasoning, no strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"
