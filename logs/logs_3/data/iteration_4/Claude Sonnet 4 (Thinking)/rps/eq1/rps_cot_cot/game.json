Since the hint mentions this is a \"fresh player,\" there might be a tendency for them to choose rock as their first move (this is a common pattern in psychology studies of rock-paper-scissors).\n\n7.

Looking at their moves:\npaper, rock, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock\n\nAfter the first 3 rounds (which were ties), they've been playing:\nscissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock\n\nThat's a repeating cycle of scissors-paper-rock!
