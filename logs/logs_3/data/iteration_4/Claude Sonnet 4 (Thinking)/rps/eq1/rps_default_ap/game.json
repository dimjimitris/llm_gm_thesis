They seem to play the same move over and over until they eventually switch, then get stuck in another long streak.\n\nGiven they've played scissors 4 times in a row now, and their previous streaks were 6-7 rounds long, they'll likely continue with scissors for several more rounds.\n\nI should continue playing rock to counter their scissors.",
