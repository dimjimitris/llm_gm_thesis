In rock-paper-scissors, beginners often default to rock as their first move since it feels strong and straightforward.\n\n3. If the opponent is likely to play rock, then paper would beat rock, giving me +1 point and them -1 point.\n\n4. Even if they don't play rock, paper has an equal chance against scissors and ties against another paper.\n\n5.

      "reasoning_text": "I need to analyze this rock-paper-scissors game step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the game:\n- Rock beats scissors (I get +1, opponent gets -1)\n- Paper beats rock (I get +1, opponent gets -1)  \n- Scissors beats paper (I get +1, opponent gets -1)\n- Ties give 0 points to both players\n\nMy objective is to maximize my points and/or minimize my penalties.\n\nSince this is the first round against a \"fresh player\" (meaning they haven't played before or I don't have information about their previous moves), I need to think about what strategy to use.\n\nSteps to consider:\n\n1. Analyze what I know about the opponent: They are described as a \"fresh player\", which suggests they might be new or I have no prior information about their playing patterns.\n\n2. Consider optimal strategies for rock-paper-scissors:\n   - In a truly random game, each move (rock, paper, scissors) should theoretically be played 1/3 of the time for optimal mixed strategy\n   - However, humans often have biases - many beginners tend to play rock more frequently as their first move\n   - Some players might try to be \"clever\" and play paper expecting the opponent to play rock\n\n3. Since I have no information about this player's tendencies, I should consider:\n   - What move might give me the best expected value\n   - What move might counter common beginner tendencies\n\n4. Common beginner patterns:\n   - Many people start with rock (it feels strong/aggressive)\n   - Some might overthink and play paper to counter expected rock\n   - Scissors is often the least chosen first move\n\n5. My decision: If I assume the opponent is more likely to play rock (common beginner tendency), then I should play paper to beat rock.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that they might be thinking the same way I am. But since they're described as \"fresh,\" I'll go with the assumption that they're more likely to play rock.\n \nI'll strategically choose paper to maximize my winning potential against a likely rock move.",

If they do play scissors again, rock would beat scissors, giving me +1 point and them -1 point.\n\n4.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
