This has been going on for many rounds now - every single move I make, they make the exact same move, resulting in a tie every time. \n\nThis is an interesting strategic situation. Since they're perfectly copying me, every round will result in a tie (0 points) no matter what I choose. There's no way for me to win points against a perfect mirroring strategy.\n\nHowever, the game objective is to \"maximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\" Since I'm getting 0 points each round (neither gaining nor losing), I'm technically not accumulating penalties, which satisfies the \"minimize penalties\" part of the objective.\n\nGiven that this opponent is using a perfect mirroring strategy, I should continue playing, as there's no strategic advantage to any particular move. Any move I make will be copied, resulting in a tie.\n\nI'll continue with the next move in my sequence.",
