Playing a mixed strategy\n\nSince I only have one data point (they played scissors), I don't have much to go on. I should probably just make a reasonable choice.

They might stick with rock again\n2. They might switch to something else\n3. They might try to counter what they think I'll play\n\nIf they stick with rock, I should play paper.\nIf they think I'll play rock again (since we just tied), they might play paper to beat me, so I should play scissors.\nIf they try to be unpredictable, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that this is only the third round and we don't have much data, I'll go with paper to beat rock, since rock was their last move and players sometimes repeat successful or recent moves.",
