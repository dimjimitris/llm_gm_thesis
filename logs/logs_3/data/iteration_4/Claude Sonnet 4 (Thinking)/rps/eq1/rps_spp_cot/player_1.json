    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider common first-move patterns: Many beginners in rock-paper-scissors tend to start with \"rock\" as it feels like the most natural or aggressive choice.\n\n3. Evaluate my counter-strategy: If the opponent is likely to play rock, then I should play paper to beat rock and earn +1 points.\n\n4. Consider the risk: Even if they don't play rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing - same as any other choice.\n\n5. Make the strategic choice: Paper gives me the best chance against a likely rock opening from an inexperienced player.\n\n[move] Paper"

Since I played paper, they might expect me to repeat it and play scissors to counter.\n\n3. Evaluate common post-tie patterns: Players often either stick with their previous move or switch to beat what their opponent just played.\n\n4. Plan my counter-strategy: If the opponent is likely to play scissors (to beat my previous paper), then I should play rock to beat scissors and earn +1 points.\n\n5. Consider the psychological element: Since we both made the same strategic choice in round 1, this opponent is likely thinking ahead rather than playing randomly.\n\n[move] Rock"

If they expect paper from me, they would play scissors to counter it.\n\n4. Evaluate both possibilities: If they continue their cycle, they'll play paper (I should play scissors). If they expect me to counter their previous rock, they'll play scissors (I should play rock).\n\n5.

If they expect rock, they would logically counter with paper.\n\n4. Evaluate their recent behavior: They played scissors in both rounds 2 and 4, showing some repetition in their strategy when facing my rock.\n\n5. Plan my counter-strategy: If the opponent expects me to repeat my successful rock strategy and counters with paper, then I should play scissors to beat paper and maintain my winning streak.\n\n[move] Scissors"
