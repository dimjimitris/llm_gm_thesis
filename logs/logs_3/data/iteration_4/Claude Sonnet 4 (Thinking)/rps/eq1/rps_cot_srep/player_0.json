    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Choose optimal counter-strategy: If the opponent chooses rock (which is statistically likely for a first move), paper will beat it and give me +1 point.\n\n5.

Consider opponent's likely reasoning: They might expect me to either repeat scissors (making rock their optimal counter) or switch to rock (making paper their optimal counter). Given the psychological pressure to break the tie pattern, rock seems more likely as their choice.\n\n6. Evaluate opponent's move frequency: Paper (4 times), Rock (5 times), Scissors (4 times).

Analyze opponent's strategic thinking: They correctly anticipated my counters in the last three rounds, showing advanced prediction skills.\n\n5. Consider opponent's likely reasoning: After winning with rock, they'll probably expect me to play the obvious counter (paper). If they think I'll play paper, they would choose scissors to beat it.\n\n6.

Identify recent breakthrough: I broke their 3-round winning streak by correctly predicting their scissors with my rock.\n\n4. Analyze opponent's likely reasoning: After losing with scissors to my rock, they'll probably expect me to repeat the winning move (rock) and would logically counter with paper.\n\n5. Consider opponent's move frequency: Paper (8 times), Rock (9 times), Scissors (7 times). Paper would be their logical counter-choice to expected rock.\n\n6.
