Switch to paper (their least common move)\n\nGiven that they just played scissors twice and rock is their most frequent move overall, I should probably play paper to counter rock. \n\nI'm detecting a complex psychological game emerging. Their recent two-scissors streak breaks their typical rock-heavy pattern. This suggests they might be intentionally disrupting their own predictability. I'll anticipate a strategic shift, likely back to their comfort zone of rock, but with a twist to throw me off.",
