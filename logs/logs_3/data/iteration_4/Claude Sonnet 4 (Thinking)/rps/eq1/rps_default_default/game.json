If they're copying my moves, maybe I should try to exploit this by making a move that would lose to what I think they'll copy, but then they might not copy perfectly.\n\nActually, let me just try a random move and see what happens.

This doesn't help me maximize my points. \n\nHowever, there might be a delay in the copying - maybe they're copying my previous move rather than my current move. Let me think about the sequence:\n\nRecent moves where I won or lost:\n- I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n- I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won) \n- I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n- I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n- I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n- I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n\nThen we had the long string of ties. \n\nIf they're copying my current move, I'll always tie.

If they are copying my moves, then I want to try to exploit this. But if they're copying my current move, there's no way to exploit it. If they're copying my previous move, then I can beat them by playing the move that beats my previous move.\n\nLet me try a different approach - I'll play the move that beats my previous move (scissors), which would be rock.",

If so, when I played rock, they played paper to beat it. So they might continue trying to counter me.\n\nI should try to think what they might expect me to play next and either play that if I think they'll copy, or play the counter to what they might expect.\n\nGiven that they just won with paper, if they think I'll stick with rock, they might play paper again.
