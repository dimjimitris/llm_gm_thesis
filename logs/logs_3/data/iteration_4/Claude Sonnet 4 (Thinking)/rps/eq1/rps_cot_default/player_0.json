    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Recognize the concerning trend: I've lost the last 2 rounds and only won 1 of the last 8 rounds. My prediction strategy isn't working well anymore.\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent behavior: They used rock twice in a row (rounds 10-11), which is unusual for them since they typically switch moves.\n\n4. Consider their likely next move: After using rock twice, they'll probably switch. Given their adaptability, they might choose paper or scissors.\n\n5. Choose a strategic counter: Since they're likely to switch from rock, and paper seems like a natural choice after rock, I'll choose scissors to counter paper. Even if they choose scissors, it's a tie, and if they surprisingly stick with rock, I lose but break their potential rock streak.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors to counter the likely paper switch from their double-rock usage.\n\n[move] scissors"

Recognize the adaptation problem: The opponent is clearly adapting to my prediction strategy. I've only won 1 of the last 10 rounds, with 6 ties and 3 losses.\n\n3. Change my approach: Instead of trying to predict their patterns, I need to be more unpredictable myself. My predictive strategy is failing against this adaptive opponent.\n\n4. Consider a strategic shift: Since they just used scissors and typically switch, they'll likely choose rock or paper. But instead of trying to predict which one, I'll make a choice that covers my bases reasonably well.\n\n5. Choose rock strategically: Rock beats scissors (if they repeat), ties with rock, and loses to paper. Given their tendency to switch and the fact that rock is a solid defensive choice, it's a reasonable option.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock as a solid defensive choice while shifting away from predictive strategy.\n\n[move] rock"

Choose based on immediate tactical considerations: They just used rock. Rather than trying to predict if they'll switch or what they'll switch to, I'll make a straightforward counter-move.\n\n5.
