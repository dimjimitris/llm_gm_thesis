Let me check:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo I made paper, opponent made scissors. According to the rules, paper beats scissors, so I should win and get 1 point. But the hint says I won and scored 1 point. Wait, that doesn't match what I expected.\n\nLet me re-read: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nActually, that's wrong. If paper beats scissors, then when I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I should win. But the rules say \"paper beats scissors\" - that means paper is the winner when matched against scissors.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-read more carefully:\n\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nThis means: when paper faces scissors, paper wins and gets 1 point, scissors loses and gets -1 points.\n\nI played paper, opponent played scissors. So I should have won and gotten 1 point. The hint confirms this - I won and scored 1 point. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, I was expecting to get 3 points if my opponent played rock (since rock beats paper and gives 3 points to the winner, but I would be the loser in that case). I was hoping my opponent would play rock so I could... no wait, that's backwards. If opponent plays rock and I play paper, then rock beats paper, so opponent wins 3 points and I lose 3 points.\n\nLet me think about this strategically. The payoff matrix from my perspective:\n- If I play paper vs opponent's rock: I lose 3 points\n- If I play paper vs opponent's paper: tie, 0 points  \n\n\n- If I play paper vs opponent's scissors: I win 1 point\n\nI see the strategic implications now. Each move has potential gains and risks. Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper. The point system adds complexity to the traditional game strategy. Winning isn't just about beating the opponent, but maximizing point differential.\n\nMy opponent played scissors first, which suggests multiple potential follow-up strategies. I'm anticipating their next move by considering psychological patterns. By predicting their likely counter-moves, I can strategically select my play to maximize points.\n\nThe most lucrative outcome remains rock against paper, earning 3 points. Given the psychological tendency of new players to overthink, I'll likely choose rock to capitalize on potential predictable behavior.",

Play rock to complete the cycle (scissors, paper, rock)\n2. Try to counter what they think I'll do\n3.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
