      "reasoning_text": "Let me think through this step by step to maximize my points.\n\nFirst, let me understand the payoff matrix:\n- Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Ties give 0 points to both players\n\nSo the key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\nSteps to consider:\n\n1. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new or inexperienced\n2. Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns or might choose randomly\n3. I need to think about what move maximizes my expected value\n\nLet me think about each move:\n- If I play rock: I get +3 if they play paper, -1 if they play scissors, 0 if they play rock\n- If I play paper: I get +1 if they play scissors, -3 if they play rock, 0 if they play paper  \n- If I play scissors: I get +1 if they play rock, -1 if they play paper, 0 if they play scissors\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\", they might not have a sophisticated strategy. Many beginners tend to start with rock (it's often the first thing people think of) or choose randomly.\n\nIf I assume they're likely to play rock (common for beginners), then scissors would be my best choice since scissors beats rock for +1 points.\n\nIf I assume they're choosing randomly (1/3 probability each), let me calculate expected values:\n- Rock: (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 1 + (-1/3) + 0 = 2/3\n- Paper: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*0 = 1/3 + (-1) + 0 = -2/3  \n\n\n- Scissors: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 1/3 + (-1/3) + 0 = 0\n\nI'll choose scissors, anticipating a likely rock move from a fresh player. This strategy gives me the best chance of gaining points.",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
