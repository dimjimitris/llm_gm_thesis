      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze the game so far:\n\nFirst 13 rounds: All ties (rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper)\n\nThen:\nRound 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock - I won (+1)\nRound 15: I played rock, opponent played paper - I won (+3)\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I lost (-1)\nRound 17: I played paper, opponent played rock - I lost (-3)\nRound 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I lost (-1)\nRound 19: I played paper, opponent played paper - Tie (0)\nRound 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I lost (-1)\nRound 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I won (+1)\nRound 22: I played paper, opponent played rock - I lost (-3)\n\nCurrent score: 1 + 3 - 1 - 3 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 - 3 = -4\n\nLooking at the opponent's recent moves after the tie streak:\nrock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, rock\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a clear pattern, but they've played scissors quite a bit recently. Let me think about what to play next.\n\nThey just played rock. In the past few rounds:\n- Round 17: rock\n- Round 19: paper  \n- Round 20: scissors\n- Round 21: scissors\n- Round 22: rock\n\nIt's hard to predict their next move. Since rock gives me the maximum reward (3 points) if they play paper, and scissors gives me 1 point if they play rock, I need to think strategically.\n\nGiven that they just played rock, they might switch to something else. If I play scissors and they play rock again, I win 1 point. If I play rock and they play paper, I win 3 points. \n\nI'll choose scissors, anticipating they might continue with rock, which would give me a 1-point advantage.",

      "reasoning_text": "Let me think about the recent pattern:\n\nRecent rounds:\n- They played rock, I played scissors, I won 1 point\n- They played rock, I played paper, I lost 3 points  \n- They played scissors, I played paper, I won 1 point\n- They played scissors, I played rock, I lost 1 point\n- They played paper, I played rock, tie 0 points\n- They played scissors, I played paper, I lost 3 points\n- They played scissors, I played rock, I lost 1 point\n\nWait, let me reread more carefully:\n\nMost recent:\n- They played rock, I played scissors, I won 1 point\n- Before that: They played rock, I played paper, I lost 3 points\n- Before that: They played scissors, I played paper, I won 1 point  \n- Before that: They played scissors, I played rock, I lost 1 point\n- Before that: They played paper, I played rock, tie 0 points\n- Before that: They played rock, I played paper, I lost 3 points\n- Before that: They played scissors, I played rock, I lost 1 point\n\nSo their recent sequence has been: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, rock\n\nThey just played rock twice in a row. Maybe they'll switch to something else, or continue with rock. If they continue with rock, I should play scissors. If they switch, it's hard to predict.\n\nGiven that rock offers me the maximum reward (3 points) if they play paper, and scissors gives me 1 point if they play rock, I think I'll go with scissors since they just played rock twice and might continue that pattern.",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
