Consider that rock has the highest potential reward (+3 points) with moderate risk (-1 penalty)\n3. Against a fresh player, they may choose randomly or pick rock (common first instinct)\n4. Rock has the best expected value against random play and good risk-reward ratio\n5.

I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - If I play rock and win (against paper), I get +3 points\n   - If I play paper and win (against scissors), I get +1 point\n   - If I play scissors and win (against rock), I get +1 point\n   - If I lose with rock (against scissors), I get -1 point\n   - If I lose with paper (against rock), I get -3 points\n   - If I lose with scissors (against paper), I get -1 point\n\n3. Strategy considerations:\n   - Rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but only moderate penalty (-1) when it loses\n   - Paper has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses, but only moderate reward (+1) when it wins\n   - Scissors has moderate reward (+1) when it wins and moderate penalty (-1) when it loses\n\n4. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Pick rock first (it's intuitive/feels strong)\n   - Pick randomly\n   - Don't think about the asymmetric payoffs\n\n5. Given the payoff structure, rock seems like a strong choice because:\n   - It has the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - It has a relatively low penalty if it loses (-1)\n   - Against a fresh player who might choose rock (common first choice), it would tie (0 points)\n   - If they choose paper, I lose badly (-3), but if they choose scissors, I win moderately (+1)\n   \nI'm now considering paper's potential. If the fresh player chooses rock, which is common, paper would give me +1 points. This introduces a nuanced calculation of expected value based on random selection probabilities.\n\nThe expected value analysis suggests carefully weighing each move's potential outcomes against likely opponent strategies. I'll need to calculate the precise probabilities to make the most strategic choice.\n\nUltimately, rock seems to offer the most balanced risk-reward profile, providing a solid strategic approach against an unpredictable opponent.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
