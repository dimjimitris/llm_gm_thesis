    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats paper: +3/-3 points (highest risk/reward)\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1/-1 points \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1/-1 points\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - Playing against a \"fresh player\" suggests they're new\n   - New players often choose rock intuitively (it feels strong/aggressive)\n   - They likely don't have a developed strategy yet\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they choose rock (likely), paper wins me +3 points\n   - If they choose scissors, I lose -1 point with paper\n   - If they choose paper, it's a tie with 0 points\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Paper has good upside (+3) if they pick rock\n   - Limited downside (-1) if they pick scissors\n   - Reasonable probability they pick rock as a beginner\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper is the optimal choice given the high likelihood of a new player choosing rock and the favorable +3 point reward.\n\n[move] paper"

Review what happened last round:\n   - I chose paper, opponent chose scissors\n   - I won +1 point (paper beats scissors)\n   - My initial prediction that they'd choose rock was wrong\n\n2. Analyze opponent's potential next move:\n   - They might think I'll stick with paper since it won\n   - A logical counter to paper would be rock\n   - Fresh players often try simple counter-strategies\n\n3. Consider my response options:\n   - If they choose rock (to counter my previous paper), I should choose paper for +3 points\n   - If they choose scissors again, paper loses -1 point\n   - If they choose paper, it's a tie\n\n4. Risk/reward evaluation:\n   - Paper gives +3 if they choose rock (good upside)\n   - Paper gives -1 if they choose scissors (manageable downside)\n   - Rock beating is a common beginner adjustment after losing\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper again, betting they'll try rock to counter my previous winning move.\n\n[move] paper"
