      "reasoning_text": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the game:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points  \n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Same moves = tie, no points\n\nSo the payoff matrix looks like:\n- If I play paper: I win 1 vs scissors, lose 3 vs rock, tie vs paper\n- If I play rock: I win 3 vs paper, lose 1 vs scissors, tie vs rock\n- If I play scissors: I win 1 vs rock, lose 1 vs paper, tie vs scissors\n\nKey observations:\n1. Rock has the highest reward (3 points) when it wins\n2. But rock also has the lowest penalty when losing (only -1 point vs scissors)\n3. Paper has moderate reward (1 point) but high penalty (-3 points vs rock)\n4. Scissors has moderate reward (1 point) and moderate penalty (-1 point vs paper)\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (meaning someone new/inexperienced), I need to think about what they might choose:\n- New players often choose rock as it's seen as \"strong\" \n- Or they might choose randomly\n- They probably don't know the payoff differences yet\n\nStrategy considerations:\n1. If they choose rock (common for new players), I should choose scissors to win 1 point\n2. If they choose paper, I should choose rock to win 3 points (big payoff!)\n3. If they choose scissors, I should choose paper to win 1 point\n\nGiven that rock gives the biggest payoff differential (3 points vs -3 points), and new players might not realize paper is vulnerable to rock, I think rock could be a good choice. It maximizes my potential gain if they choose paper.\n \nI'm now calculating the expected value more carefully. If they're equally likely to choose rock or paper, my rock strategy gives an average of +1 point. This nuanced probability analysis suggests rock might still be the optimal choice, balancing potential gains and risks.\n\nHowever, considering a fresh player's likely intuition, rock seems the most probable initial move. This insight shifts my strategy toward scissors, anticipating their probable rock selection.",

Fresh players often have patterns - they might:\n   - Stick with rock thinking it was just bad luck\n   - Switch to paper to beat what I just played (scissors)\n   - Switch to scissors to copy my winning move\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - Rock beats paper: +3/-3 points\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1/-1 points  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1/-1 points\n\n4.
