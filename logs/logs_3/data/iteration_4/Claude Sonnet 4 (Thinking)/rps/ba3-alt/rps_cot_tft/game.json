This makes the rock vs paper matchup much more significant.\n\n2. I'm facing a \"fresh player\" - new players often gravitate toward rock as their first move since it seems aggressive and straightforward.\n\n3. If I play paper and they play rock (likely), I win 3 points - the maximum possible gain.\n\n4. If I'm wrong and they play scissors, I only lose 1 point - a manageable risk.\n\n5. The risk-reward ratio favors playing paper: potential +3 gain vs potential -1 loss against the most probable opponent move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper",
      "thinking_text": null,
      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze this game step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets +3, loser gets -3  \n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. The payoffs are asymmetric - rock beating paper gives much higher reward (+3/-3) compared to the other winning combinations (+1/-1).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\", I need to think about what they might do:\n   - A fresh/new player might not know the optimal strategy\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - They might have some intuitive preference\n\n4. Let me think about the strategic implications:\n   - If I play rock and they play paper, I lose 3 points (bad)\n   - If I play paper and they play rock, I win 3 points (very good)\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock, I lose 1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper, I win 1 point\n\n5. The key insight is that rock has the highest reward when it wins (+3 when beating paper) but also the highest penalty differential. However, paper is the move that can defend against rock and gain the maximum points.\n\n6. For a first move against a fresh player, I should consider:\n   - Rock is a common first choice for new players (it's aggressive, simple)\n   - If they choose rock, I want to play paper to win big (+3)\n   - If they don't choose rock, the worst I can do is lose 1 point\n\n7. Given that this is the first round and the opponent is fresh, playing paper seems like a good strategy because:\n   - It neutralizes the most probable initial move\n   - The potential loss is minimal compared to the potential gain\n   - It exploits the likely predictable behavior of a new player\n\nI'll strategically choose paper to maximize my chances of a favorable outcome.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
