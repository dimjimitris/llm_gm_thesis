    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure: Rock beating paper gives \u00b13 points (high stakes), while paper beating scissors and scissors beating rock only give \u00b11 points (low stakes).\n\n2. Against a fresh player, I should consider they might not fully understand this asymmetric payoff structure yet.\n\n3. Fresh players often have a psychological bias toward choosing rock initially in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\n4. If I calculate expected values assuming random opponent choice:\n   - Rock: Expected value = -2/3 points\n   - Paper: Expected value = +2/3 points  \n   - Scissors: Expected value = 0 points\n\n5. Paper has the highest expected value and also counters the common tendency for new players to choose rock.\n\n6. The high reward for paper beating rock (+3 points) makes this an attractive strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to maximize expected points against a fresh opponent.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent has played paper three consecutive times since breaking their rock pattern.\n\n2. Their paper performance: Win (+1), Loss (-3), Win (+1) = net -1, but the last play was successful against my scissors.\n\n3. They seem to be establishing a new paper pattern after abandoning their rock strategy. Three consecutive papers suggests potential commitment to this new approach.\n\n4. Expected value analysis for my options:\n   - Rock vs continued paper: +3 points (excellent)\n   - Rock vs switch to rock: -3 points (bad)\n   - Rock vs switch to scissors: +1 point (decent)\n\n5. Since paper just worked for them again against my scissors, there's reasonable probability they'll continue with what's working.\n\n6. Rock offers the maximum payoff (+3) against their emerging paper pattern and also beats scissors if they try a different counter.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to capitalize on their potential continued paper strategy and maximize expected value.\n\n[move] rock"

Given their massive historical success with rock (11 straight wins/ties) and the poor recent performance of paper (-4 net), returning to their comfort zone of rock seems most probable.\n\n6.
