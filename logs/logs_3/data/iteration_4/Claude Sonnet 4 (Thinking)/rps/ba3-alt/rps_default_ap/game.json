But the hint says \"You won the round\" and \"You scored 1 points.\" That seems inconsistent with the rules.\n\nWait, let me re-read: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo paper does beat scissors! I misread it initially. So:\n- Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n- Rock beats paper (winner gets 3, loser gets -3) \n- Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n\nSo in round 2, I played paper, opponent played scissors, paper beats scissors, so I won and got 1 point. That makes sense.\n\nNow for round 3, what should I consider?\n- Round 1: Both played rock\n- Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors\n\nThe opponent went from rock to scissors. They might be trying to cycle through moves or they might be trying to counter what they think I'll play. Since I played paper last time and won, they might expect me to play paper again and choose rock to beat it.

Now I've been playing rock to beat their paper.\n\nIf they're thinking strategically, they might switch to scissors to beat my rock. But they could also stick with paper since it's been working for them recently.\n\nRock gives me the highest reward (+3) if they play paper, but -1 if they play scissors.\nScissors gives me +1 if they play rock, but -1 if they play paper.\n\n\nPaper gives me +1 if they play scissors, but risks a significant -3 if they play rock.\n\nAnalyzing the potential outcomes, rock remains the most strategic choice given their recent paper-heavy pattern.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
