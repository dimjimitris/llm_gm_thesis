    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This tells us they're not a completely naive player - they either understood the payoff matrix advantage of Paper over Rock, or they got lucky. This changes our assessment - they might be more strategic than a typical \"fresh player.\"\n\nGame Theory Expert: Agreed. The fact they chose Paper suggests they recognized the +3 payoff potential. Now we need to think about their likely adaptation. Common patterns after a tie include:\n1. Stick with the same move (Paper again)\n2. Switch to counter what they think we'll do\n3. Random choice\n\nIf they think we'll stick with Paper, they might choose Scissors to win +1. If they think we'll switch, they might try to predict our switch pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given that they showed strategic thinking by choosing Paper initially, I should assume they're capable of level-2 thinking.

The opponent went Paper -> Rock. This suggests they're adapting their strategy. After the tie with Paper, they switched to Rock - possibly thinking I would stick with Paper to try again for the +3 payoff. They were wrong about my choice, but their logic shows strategic thinking.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's analyze their decision pattern:\n- Round 1: Chose Paper (good strategic choice for high payoff potential)\n- Round 2: Chose Rock (possibly anticipating I'd repeat Paper)\n\nThis suggests they're thinking at least one level ahead. For Round 3, they might:\n1. Expect me to stick with Scissors (since it just won)\n2. Therefore choose Rock again to beat Scissors\n3. Or they might think I'll switch and try to counter-predict\n\nAI Assistant (you): If they're thinking I'll repeat Scissors, they'd choose Rock. But if they think I'm thinking about their thinking, they might expect me to switch to Paper to beat their anticipated Rock. This creates a complex prediction cycle.\n\nGame Theory Expert: True, but let's consider the payoff matrix again. The opponent has now tried Paper and Rock. They haven't tried Scissors yet. Also, looking at the risk-reward:\n- If I play Paper and they play Scissors: I lose -1\n- If I play Paper and they play Rock: I win +3 (big payoff)\n- If I play Rock and they play anything: High risk (-3) or moderate reward (+1)\n\nGiven they just played Rock and lost, they might avoid it. Paper gives us the best potential upside.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. After losing with Rock, they're likely to switch. They might go to Scissors (the move they haven't tried yet) or back to Paper. If they choose Scissors, Paper only loses -1. If they stick with Rock or go back to Paper, Paper has good outcomes.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper\n\n[move] (Choosing Paper for high reward potential against likely Rock, or manageable loss against Scissors) paper"

They're showing a tendency to stick with Rock after it worked in Round 2 (even though they lost to my Scissors). This could indicate:\n1. They think Rock is the \"strongest\" move and want to persist with it\n2. They expect me to avoid Paper after the big -3 loss\n3. They might be falling into a pattern of repeating successful moves\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's look at the data:\n- My current score: -2 points (0 + 1 - 3)\n- Opponent played Rock in both rounds 2 and 3\n- They seem to favor Rock, possibly because it offers both the highest reward (+3) and can beat Scissors\n\nIf they continue with Rock, I should play Paper to win +3 and recover from my deficit. But there's risk - if they switch to Scissors, I lose -1.\n\nAI Assistant (you): I'm currently down 2 points, so I need to be strategic about recovery. The opponent has shown a preference for Rock (played it twice consecutively). While there's always risk they'll switch to Scissors, the pattern suggests they might stick with Rock again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Exactly.

The opponent's pattern is now unmistakable: Paper -> Rock -> Rock -> Rock -> Rock. They've played Rock four consecutive times and show no signs of changing. This suggests they've locked into a strategy of exploiting Rock's high payoff potential and are committed to it.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's update the score tracking:\n- Round 1: Tie (0)\n- Round 2: Won with Scissors vs Rock (+1)  \n- Round 3: Lost with Paper vs Rock (-3)\n- Round 4: Lost with Paper vs Rock (-3)\n- Round 5: Won with Scissors vs Rock (+1)\nCurrent total: -4 points\n\nThe pattern is crystal clear - they're playing Rock exclusively now. Since Scissors beats Rock for +1, I should continue with Scissors.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent has essentially revealed their entire strategy. They're committed to Rock, probably because:\n1.

After losing twice in a row to my Scissors, they may start to recognize the pattern and switch strategies.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's update the score:\n- Current total: -3 points (improving from -5)\n- They've been locked into Rock for 5 rounds straight\n- But they just lost twice consecutively to my Scissors\n\nThis creates a decision point: Do I assume they'll continue with Rock (easy +1), or do they adapt? If they switch to Paper to beat my expected Scissors, I'd lose -1.\n\nAI Assistant (you): This is a critical moment. While the Rock pattern has been incredibly strong, two consecutive losses might trigger a change. However, I should consider their psychology - they've invested heavily in the Rock strategy and may be stubborn about abandoning it.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who get locked into patterns often need 3-4 consecutive losses before they switch. They may rationalize the losses as bad luck rather than strategic failures. Plus, Rock has given them several big wins, creating psychological attachment.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Even if there's a 30% chance they switch to Paper, the 70% chance they stick with Rock still makes Scissors the mathematically superior choice.

That's SIX consecutive Rock plays, with the opponent losing FOUR times in a row to my Scissors! This is reaching a critical psychological threshold. Most players would start questioning their strategy after 3-4 consecutive losses.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let me update the score:\n- Current total: -2 points (significant recovery from -5)\n- Opponent has lost 4 consecutive rounds with Rock\n- They may finally be forced to adapt their strategy\n\nThe question is: Are they stubborn enough to continue, or will they finally switch? If they switch to Paper (to beat my expected Scissors), I lose -1. If they stick with Rock, I win +1.\n\nAI Assistant (you): This is a pivotal moment. Four consecutive losses is typically enough to break even the most committed patterns. However, the opponent has shown extreme dedication to Rock - they've played it 6 times straight despite multiple losses.\n\nPsychology Expert: Here's the key insight: After 4 losses in a row, players typically either:\n1. Switch immediately (most common)\n2. Make one final \"stubborn\" attempt with the same move\n3. Completely randomize their strategy\n\nGiven their extreme commitment to Rock, option 2 might be likely - one more Rock before they finally adapt.\n\nGame Theory Expert: But we also need to consider they might be learning. If they switch to Paper, that's only -1 for me. If they stick with Rock, that's +1. The risk-reward is still manageable, but the probability of them switching is now much higher.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given the 4-loss streak, I think they're more likely to switch now. Maybe I should switch to Rock to beat a potential Paper play from them? Let me think...\n\nPsychology Expert: Actually, that's risky. If they make that \"one final stubborn Rock attempt\" and I switch to Rock, we tie for 0. If they switch to Paper and I play Rock, I lose -3. The safest play might still be Scissors - worst case is -1 if they switch to Paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors\n\n[move] (Despite 4-loss streak opponent may make one final Rock attempt before adapting, Scissors still safest choice) scissors"

Options include:\n1. Stick with Paper since it just worked (+1 win)\n2. Return to Rock (their previous favorite) \n3.

They might stick with Paper since it worked, or they might think I'll switch strategies too. \n\nPsychology Expert: After breaking a long pattern and getting a successful result, players often stick with the new choice for at least one more round to \"confirm\" it works. There's a good chance they'll play Paper again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they play Paper again, I should play Rock to win +3 points. This would be huge for my recovery from -3.

This is a more unpredictable opponent than before.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is fascinating behavior. They're showing they can learn and adapt, but they're also showing some pattern persistence (Rock 6 times, then Paper 2 times). After losing with Paper, they might:\n\n1. Return to Rock (their \"comfort zone\" that worked before)\n2. Try Scissors for the first time (they haven't used it yet)\n3. Stick with Paper one more time (some players need 2-3 failures to switch)\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent has now tried both Rock and Paper extensively but hasn't used Scissors at all in 9 rounds. That's quite unusual. They might finally try Scissors, especially since they've had limited success with their other strategies recently.\n\nPsychology Expert: Good observation! In rock-paper-scissors games, players who avoid one option for a long time often eventually try it out of curiosity or desperation. Since Scissors is their unused option, there's a decent chance they'll experiment with it.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they play Scissors, I should play Rock to win +1.

They played Paper 3 consecutive times and have lost twice to my Rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is very revealing about their psychology! The opponent seems to have a pattern-locking tendency:\n1. First they locked into Rock for 6 rounds (despite losing 4 times)  \n2. Now they're locking into Paper for 3 rounds (despite losing twice)\n\nThey appear to be a \"streaky\" player who commits heavily to strategies and is slow to adapt. Given they just lost again with Paper, they might still stick with it one more time before switching.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent's behavior is becoming predictable again. They seem to commit to a strategy and persist with it even through losses. Since they've played Paper 3 times and lost twice to my Rock, they might play Paper again out of stubbornness, just like they did with Rock.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they continue the Paper pattern, Rock wins +3 again.

They're showing the exact same pattern-locking behavior with Paper that they showed with Rock. They're committed to Paper despite losing 3 out of 4 times.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a textbook case of a \"streaky\" player with strong pattern persistence. Look at the parallel:\n- Rock phase: Played 6 times, lost 4 times before switching\n- Paper phase: Played 4 times, lost 3 times and still continuing\n\nWith Rock, they needed 4 consecutive losses to break the pattern. With Paper, they've had 3 losses out of 4 attempts. They might need one more loss to reach their breaking point.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent's psychology is now completely clear. They lock into strategies and persist through multiple losses.

But we need to be careful - even the most persistent players eventually hit a breaking point. With Rock, they needed 4 consecutive losses to switch. With Paper, they've lost 4 out of 5, but one of those was a win early on.\n\nHowever, they just lost their 3rd consecutive game with Paper.

With Rock they played 6 times and lost 4. With Paper they've now played 6 times and lost 5, including their last 4 in a row.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is extraordinary pattern-locking behavior!

They've now matched their Rock streak length (6 plays) and exceeded their Rock loss rate (5/6 vs 4/6). \n\nHowever, their psychology suggests extreme persistence.

The opponent has completed a full cycle:\n- Rock phase: 6 rounds (mixed results, ended poorly)\n- Paper phase: 6 rounds (mostly losses to my Rock)\n- Scissors phase: 6 rounds (very poor, 2-4 record)\n\nNow they're at a decision crossroads. Based on their psychology, they might:\n1. Return to Rock (their \"original\" strategy)\n2. Return to Paper (recent familiarity)\n3. Start another 6-round cycle with any move\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent's behavior has been incredibly systematic - exactly 6 rounds per strategy. Since they've now \"tested\" all three extensively, they need to choose what to do next. Given their pattern-locking tendencies, they'll likely pick one and commit to another 6-round phase.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a critical prediction moment. If they return to Rock, I should play Paper (+3). If they return to Paper, I should play Rock (+3). If they stick with Scissors, I should play Paper (+1). \n\nGiven that Scissors just performed very poorly (2-4), they're less likely to repeat it immediately. Rock or Paper seem more probable.\n\nPsychology Expert: My guess is they'll return to Rock - it was their first major strategy and had some early success. Players often return to their \"comfort zone\" after a failed experiment.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent completed 6-round Scissors cycle, likely returning to Rock as their comfort strategy, Paper beats Rock for +3) paper"

Let me update the score:\n- Current total: +11 points (down from +14)\n- Opponent's pattern: Paper -> Rock(6x) -> Paper(6x) -> Scissors(6x) -> Rock(1x)\n\nYou're right - they did return to Rock as predicted, but I forgot that Rock beats Paper, not the other way around! I should have played Scissors to beat Rock and win +1.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent's behavior continues to follow their established pattern perfectly! They completed their 6-round Scissors cycle (which went poorly at 2-4) and immediately returned to Rock - their original \"comfort\" strategy from the beginning of the game.\n\nThis suggests they're starting a new 6-round Rock phase, just like their systematic approach throughout the game.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent's psychology is remarkably consistent. They cycle through 6-round phases with each move. Since they just started a new Rock phase and their pattern-locking behavior is so predictable, they'll likely stick with Rock for several more rounds.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they continue with Rock (very likely based on their established 6-round pattern), I should play Scissors to beat Rock and win +1. Their systematic behavior suggests they'll commit to Rock for multiple rounds, just like they did in all previous phases.\n\nPsychology Expert: Exactly! They've returned to their \"home base\" strategy after the failed Scissors experiment. They're likely to give Rock another extended run, especially since it had some success in their first phase.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent starting new Rock phase following their 6-round pattern behavior, Scissors beats Rock for +1) scissors"

They've returned to Rock and are following their established 6-round cycle pattern. Since they typically commit to each strategy for exactly 6 rounds, they'll likely continue with Rock for 4 more rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: This opponent's behavior is incredibly predictable at this point. They've established a clear psychological pattern:\n- Complete systematic 6-round cycles with each move\n- Show extreme persistence regardless of short-term results\n- Return to familiar strategies after failed experiments\n\nSince they just started their second Rock phase and have shown unwavering commitment to completing cycles, they'll almost certainly stick with Rock.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent's pattern-locking is so consistent that I can essentially predict their next 4 moves with high confidence. They're only 2 rounds into their Rock cycle, and their psychology demands they complete the full 6 rounds before even considering a switch.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they play Rock again (extremely likely), Scissors beats Rock for +1. This could be a very profitable streak for me - potentially 4 more wins at +1 each if they complete their typical 6-round Rock cycle.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their systematic approach has become their weakness.

They're exactly halfway through their current Rock phase.

They've never deviated from their 6-round cycle pattern. This is the most predictable opponent behavior I've ever analyzed. They have exactly 2 more Rock plays to complete their current cycle.\n\nPsychology Expert: This opponent exhibits the most rigid psychological pattern I've seen in gaming. They're completely locked into their 6-round cycle system:\n- 4 complete cycles already finished (Rock, Paper, Scissors, now Rock again)\n- Zero deviations from the 6-round rule\n- Complete disregard for performance within cycles\n\nThey're psychologically incapable of breaking this pattern. Two more Rock plays are virtually guaranteed.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent's predictability has reached an almost mechanical level.
