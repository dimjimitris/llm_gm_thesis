    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

            "text": "I need to identify the right personas to help me win this rock-paper-scissors variant with asymmetric payoffs.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Risk Analysis Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Rock has the highest reward (+3) but also highest risk (-3). Paper and scissors have symmetric +1/-1 payoffs. Against a completely random opponent, the expected value of each move would be: Rock = (3-3+0)/3 = 0, Paper = (1-1+0)/3 = 0, Scissors = (1-1+0)/3 = 0. So all moves have equal expected value against random play.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed sophisticated strategies yet. Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors variants tend to: 1) Start with rock (it feels \"strong\"), 2) Avoid complex reasoning on first moves, 3) Play somewhat predictably. However, the unusual payoff structure might make them cautious about rock due to the high penalty risk.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** The risk-reward profile is crucial here. Rock is high-risk/high-reward, while paper and scissors are low-risk/low-reward. Against an unknown opponent, we need to consider: Do we want to play it safe with +1/-1 moves, or go for the big +3 with rock? Since it's just one round and we don't know the opponent's tendencies, a moderate risk approach might be best.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that this is a fresh player who might be intimidated by rock's high penalty (-3), they might avoid rock initially. If they play paper or scissors, then rock would give me +3 points. But if they do play rock, I'd lose -3. What's your recommendation for the opening move?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** For an opening move against an unknown opponent, I'd recommend rock. Here's why: 1) Fresh players often avoid rock due to loss aversion (the -3 penalty seems scary), 2) The potential +3 gain is worth the risk in a single round, 3) If the opponent is truly random, all moves are equivalent anyway.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree with rock. Fresh players typically exhibit loss aversion and might shy away from the high-penalty move. They're more likely to start with paper or scissors, making rock a good choice.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** Rock is the right call here. The asymmetric payoff structure favors aggressive play when you suspect the opponent will be conservative.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play rock as my opening move, reasoning that a fresh player is likely to avoid the high-risk rock option themselves, making them vulnerable to my rock play.\n\n[move] Rock"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Excellent! We gained +3 points. Now for round 2 analysis: The opponent played paper, which suggests they might have been thinking about the game strategically (paper beats rock in normal rules, though here rock beats paper). They now know we're willing to play the high-risk rock move. This creates several possibilities: 1) They might expect us to play rock again (momentum thinking), 2) They might adapt and play scissors to counter our potential rock, 3) They might switch to rock themselves now that they've seen it pays off.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent just lost with paper, so they're likely experiencing some frustration and may want to either: 1) Counter our rock with scissors next time, or 2) Copy our winning strategy and play rock themselves. Fresh players often exhibit \"copycat\" behavior after losing. However, they might also think we'll change our strategy since rock \"worked too well.\"\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** We're now +3 points ahead. We can afford to be slightly more conservative since we have a cushion. But we should also consider that the opponent might be learning. If they play scissors (expecting our rock), we'd lose -1 with rock. If they play rock (copying us), it's a tie with 0 points.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So the opponent could either try to counter my rock with scissors, or copy my successful rock strategy. What would be the best counter-play here?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If we think they'll play scissors to counter our rock, we should play paper (paper beats scissors for +1). If we think they'll copy and play rock, any move gives us 0 (tie). The question is: are they more likely to counter-attack or copycat?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players more commonly try to counter the opponent's last successful move rather than immediately copying it. They probably think \"they played rock and won, so I need to beat rock with scissors.\" I'd lean toward them playing scissors.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** Given our +3 lead, playing paper is lower risk. If they play scissors (likely), we get +1. If they play rock (copying), we get 0. If they play paper, we get -1. The risk-reward seems favorable for paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The consensus seems to be that they'll likely play scissors to counter my successful rock, so paper would be the optimal response.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play paper, expecting the opponent to try countering my previous rock with scissors.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Interesting! We both played paper, which means we were both expecting the opponent to play scissors. The opponent's pattern so far: paper, paper. This suggests they're either: 1) Playing defensively with low-risk moves, 2) Stuck in a pattern, or 3) Still trying to figure out the optimal strategy. They seem to be avoiding rock (the high-risk move) and scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Two papers in a row from the opponent suggests they're playing conservatively. They lost big (-3) in round 1, tied in round 2, and might be risk-averse now. Fresh players often get \"burned\" by high-risk moves and then over-correct toward safety. They might continue with low-risk moves (paper/scissors) and avoid rock.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** We're still +3 overall. The opponent seems to be favoring paper, which is only beaten by scissors in this system. If they play paper again (showing pattern behavior), scissors would give us +1. If they finally switch to rock (going for the big win), we'd lose -1 with scissors. If they play scissors, it's a tie with scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent has played paper twice now. Should I exploit this pattern with scissors, or do you think they'll break the pattern?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The consecutive papers suggest either pattern-playing or risk aversion. If it's pattern-playing, scissors beats paper for +1. If it's risk aversion, they're likely to stick with paper/scissors and avoid rock. Scissors seems like a good bet.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After losing big and then tying, they might feel \"safe\" with paper and continue the pattern. Fresh players often repeat moves that don't lose points. I'd expect another paper, making scissors the optimal choice.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** Scissors gives us the best expected value if they continue with paper (+1), breaks even if they switch to scissors (0), and only loses -1 if they suddenly switch to rock. The risk-reward profile favors scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** All three experts agree on scissors to exploit the apparent paper pattern. Let's go with that.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play scissors, expecting the opponent to continue their paper pattern or at least stick with low-risk moves.\n\n[move] Scissors"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Great! We're now +4 points total. The opponent's sequence: paper, paper, rock. They finally tried the high-risk rock move and lost -1 to our scissors. Now they've experienced losses with both paper (-3 to our rock) and rock (-1 to our scissors). They haven't tried scissors yet. This pattern suggests they're experimenting with all moves rather than sticking to one strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent seems to be learning through trial and error. They've now lost with both paper and rock, so they might try scissors next (the only move they haven't used). Alternatively, they might return to paper since that only lost -1 this time versus the -3 loss in round 1. Fresh players often have short memory and focus on recent results.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** We have a strong +4 lead, so we can afford some risk. If they play scissors (their unused move), rock would give us +3. If they go back to paper, scissors gives us +1. If they stick with rock, paper gives us +1. The question is: are they systematic (trying each move) or reactive (avoiding recent losses)?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent has tried paper twice and rock once, but never scissors. Are they likely to complete the set with scissors, or will they avoid it and go back to a previous move?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given they're experimenting, scissors is the logical next move for them to try. They've experienced both other options and lost. If they play scissors, our rock would win big (+3 points), which could be decisive.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree they'll likely try scissors - it's human nature to want to \"complete the set\" and try the move they haven't used yet. Plus, they might think scissors is \"due\" since they haven't tried it.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** With our +4 lead, going for rock to counter their likely scissors makes sense. Even if we're wrong and they play paper (rock loses -3), we'd still be +1 overall. The upside (+3) outweighs the risk.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The consensus is that they'll likely try scissors (their unused move), making rock the optimal counter for a potential +3 gain.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play rock, expecting the opponent to try scissors for the first time as they experiment with all available moves.\n\n[move] Rock"
