    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Interesting! The opponent chose scissors instead of the expected rock. This suggests they may not be as \"fresh\" as initially thought, or they're thinking more strategically. The fact that we both chose scissors could mean they were also anticipating rock from me, or it was coincidental.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This new information changes our assessment. The opponent demonstrated they're not following the typical beginner pattern of choosing rock first. They might be:\n1. Thinking strategically about payoffs\n2. Using some form of mixed strategy\n3. Still playing randomly but happened to pick scissors\n\n**Risk Assessment Analyst:** Since they showed strategic thinking by not defaulting to rock, I need to reconsider. If they're analyzing payoffs, they might now expect me to switch strategies. The asymmetric payoffs still favor avoiding situations where rock beats paper (-3 points).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given they played scissors (which counters rock), they might expect me to play rock this round, thinking I'll try to capitalize on the high payoff. This makes paper a strong counter-choice. If they play rock expecting me to play rock, paper gives me +1. If they stick with scissors, I lose -1. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's also the possibility they'll repeat scissors, thinking I might switch to rock. Many players have patterns or stick with what worked (even though it tied).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Considering the opponent showed strategic thinking and the payoff structure, paper seems like a good choice. It counters rock (if they expect me to go for the high-value play) and has moderate risk against other options.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter potential rock while managing risk.\n\n[move] (Opponent showed strategic thinking last round, so countering potential rock play) paper"

This could indicate they're either playing randomly, following some personal pattern, or they anticipated my paper play after the tie. The fact they switched from scissors to rock shows adaptability.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent has now demonstrated they'll use both scissors and rock. Given the sequence (scissors, rock), if there's any pattern-following behavior, they might go to paper next to complete the cycle. However, they could also be thinking strategically about my likely response after losing 3 points.\n\n**Risk Assessment Analyst:** I'm now at -3 points and need to recover. The opponent knows I just lost heavily, so they might expect me to:\n1. Play it safe with a lower-risk move\n2. Try to go for rock to get the high payoff back\n3. Be more unpredictable\n\nIf they expect me to play rock for revenge/recovery, they'd play paper. If they think I'll play conservatively (scissors), they might play rock again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Looking at their moves: scissors then rock. If they're thinking I'm predictable, they might expect scissors from me (since I've avoided rock so far). This would make rock their optimal choice again. But if they think I'll learn and try rock for the big payoff, they'd choose paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a big loss, many players either become more aggressive (go for rock) or more conservative. The opponent might be counting on one of these psychological responses.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the opponent's apparent strategic thinking and the need to recover points, I think scissors is the play. If they expect me to either go for rock (revenge) or play paper again (conservative), scissors counters the rock they might choose and ties with paper.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter potential rock while avoiding the high-loss paper vs rock scenario.\n\n[move] (Need to recover from -3 points, expecting opponent might play rock again) scissors"
