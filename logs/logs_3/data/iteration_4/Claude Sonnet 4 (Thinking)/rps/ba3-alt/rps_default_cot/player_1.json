    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: Rock beating Paper gives +3/-3 points (highest stakes), while Paper beating Scissors and Scissors beating Rock both give +1/-1 points.\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do: New players often choose randomly or have a slight bias toward Rock as a first move.\n\n3. Calculate expected values against a random opponent:\n   - Paper: Expected value = -2/3 (loses big to Rock, wins small against Scissors)\n   - Rock: Expected value = +2/3 (wins big against Paper, loses small to Scissors) \n   - Scissors: Expected value = 0 (balanced wins/losses)\n\n4. Rock has the highest expected value against a random opponent due to the asymmetric payoff structure where Rock's win is worth more points.\n\n5. Since I have no information about this specific opponent's tendencies, I should choose the move with the best expected return.\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock to maximize expected points against an unknown opponent.\n\n[move] Rock"

Key possibilities:\n   - They might choose paper to counter my previous rock choice (expecting me to repeat)\n   - They might stick with rock (if they think it's generally strong)\n   - They might choose scissors (random or trying to be unpredictable)\n\n3. If they're thinking strategically, they likely noticed that rock vs rock was a tie, and may anticipate I'll either repeat rock or switch.\n\n4. If they expect me to repeat rock, they'll likely choose paper to get the +3 point advantage.\n\n5. If I think they'll choose paper, I should choose scissors to win +1 point.\n\n6.

Strategic analysis:\n   - They might expect me to keep playing defensive rock after the tie\n   - If they think I'll play rock, they could switch to paper for the +3 advantage\n   - This would be their logical counter to my defensive strategy\n\n4. Risk/reward calculation:\n   - If they switch to paper: Rock wins +3 points (significant recovery)\n   - If they stick with rock: Rock ties 0 points (no progress but no loss)\n   - Playing paper risks another devastating -3 loss\n\n5. Recovery imperative:\n   - At -12 points, I need big wins, not just avoiding losses\n   - Rock gives me the chance for +3 if they adapt their strategy\n   - It's the safest way to potentially score points\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their possible strategic switch to paper.\n\n[move] Rock"
