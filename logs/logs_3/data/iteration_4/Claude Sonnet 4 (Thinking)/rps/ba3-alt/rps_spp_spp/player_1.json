    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The opponent chose rock in round 1, which aligns with my prediction about fresh players favoring rock initially. However, now they have information about our choice too. Fresh players often exhibit one of these patterns after a win:\n1. Stick with the winning move (rock again)\n2. Escalate to the \"stronger\" feeling move after success\n3. Try to counter-predict our adaptation\n\nSince they won with rock, there's a decent chance they'll play rock again, especially since it has the highest payoff (+3).\n\n**Game Theorist:** Now I have concrete data. The opponent played rock round 1. Key considerations:\n- If they repeat rock: I should play paper (lose -3, but learn more about their pattern)\n- If they switch to scissors: I should play rock (+3 points)\n- If they switch to paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\nThe expected value calculation now shifts based on their likely move distribution after winning with rock.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Given they won with rock and rock gives the highest reward, there's psychological momentum to repeat it. However, they might also think we'll counter with paper (which we would). This creates a meta-game situation. I suggest:\n- If we think they'll repeat rock: play paper\n- If we think they'll counter-predict and avoid rock: play rock to catch scissors\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on the analysis, the opponent showed they're willing to play the high-risk/high-reward rock move. Fresh players who win often repeat successful strategies. I should probably play paper to counter a likely repeat rock, accepting the risk that they might have switched.\n\n**Game Theorist:** That makes sense. Paper counters rock, and even though we lost points last round, we gained valuable information about their tendency to play rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter the likely repeated rock.\n\n[move] (Expecting opponent might repeat their winning rock strategy, so countering with paper) paper"

Rock-Rock shows this opponent is either:\n1. A true \"fresh player\" who doesn't adapt quickly and sticks with what worked\n2. Someone who recognizes rock's high payoff (+3) and is exploiting it\n3. Potentially setting up a pattern before switching\n\nThe fact they didn't adapt after I played paper twice suggests they're either inexperienced with strategic thinking or very confident in the rock strategy. Fresh players often exhibit this \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" mentality.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Two consecutive rocks is statistically significant data. If this continues, they're essentially playing a pure rock strategy, which means I should play pure paper strategy. However, there's always the risk they're about to switch. \n\nExpected scenarios for round 3:\n- Rock (60% chance based on pattern): I should play paper\n- Scissors (25% chance - switching to counter my paper): I should play rock  \n- Paper (15% chance - unlikely given their pattern): I should play scissors\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** I'm currently down 6 points (-3, -3). The opponent has shown a strong preference for rock. Even if they're about to switch, the pattern suggests rock is their default. I need to either:\n1. Continue countering with paper (high probability play)\n2. Switch to rock myself to catch a potential scissors pivot\n\nGiven their consistency, I lean toward paper again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The data strongly suggests they favor rock. While there's always risk they'll switch, two consecutive rocks from a \"fresh player\" indicates either inexperience or a deliberate high-reward strategy. I should stick with paper.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Agreed. The pattern recognition suggests paper is still the optimal counter, even with the risk of them finally adapting.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue with paper to counter the established rock pattern.\n\n[move] (Opponent has played rock twice - continuing to counter their apparent rock preference) paper"

The brief experiment with paper/scissors seems to have reinforced that rock is their best bet. \n\nGiven this rock preference, I should consider:\n- They're likely to play rock again (high confidence)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for them)\n- I should play scissors to counter their probable rock\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence strongly suggests they default to rock when uncertain, and rock has been their most successful move overall. After the brief experimentation phase, they're back to their comfort zone. I should play scissors to counter their likely rock choice.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Absolutely. Seven rounds of data shows a clear rock preference with occasional deviations. Scissors is the logical counter.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter their probable return to rock strategy.\n\n[move] (Opponent returned to their successful rock strategy after brief experimentation - scissors beats rock) scissors"

Rock statistics:\n- Total rock uses: 6\n- Rock wins: 4 \n- Rock losses: 2 (both to my scissors)\n\nThey're clearly committed to rock as their primary strategy, with 75% usage rate.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent shows remarkable consistency and stubbornness! Even after losing twice to scissors, they keep returning to rock. This suggests either:\n1. Deep-seated belief that rock is superior (confirmation bias)\n2. Inability to adapt strategically \n3. Intentional rock-heavy strategy despite occasional losses\n\nThe pattern suggests they view rock losses as temporary setbacks, not reasons to fundamentally change strategy.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Key insight: I've now won twice by playing scissors against their rock. They've seen this pattern clearly:\n- My scissors beats their rock (happened twice now)\n- Yet they continue playing rock\n\nThis suggests either they can't/won't adapt, or they're setting up for a meta-game move. If they suddenly switch to paper (which beats scissors), they'd counter my successful counter-strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The data shows extreme rock commitment despite repeated losses to my scissors. They might:\n1. Continue with rock (most likely based on pattern)\n2. Switch to paper to counter my successful scissors (strategic adaptation)\n\nIf rock: I play scissors (+1)\nIf paper: I play scissors (+1) \nIf scissors: I play rock (+3)\n\nWait, that's wrong! If they play paper and I play scissors, I win. If they play scissors and I play rock, I win big. But if they play rock and I play scissors, I win small.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Exactly.

They've now played scissors twice (rounds 6 and 9), with one success and one tie. Rock usage is still dominant (6/9 = 67%) but they're clearly adapting somewhat.\n\nKey insight: They played scissors right after I won twice with scissors against their rock. This suggests they're finally learning from the pattern and trying to neutralize my successful counter-strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a crucial psychological shift! After being stubbornly committed to rock, they're starting to mirror my successful moves. The tie might feel like progress to them after repeated losses with rock.\n\nThey might be thinking: \"If scissors works for them, maybe it'll work for me too.\" This imitation behavior is common when players start recognizing effective patterns.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** They're entering a more adaptive phase. The scissors tie shows they're paying attention to what beats their rock. Now I need to think about their next move:\n\n1. Scissors again (continue the imitation): I should play rock (+3 points)\n2. Back to rock (revert to comfort): I should play scissors (+1 point)  \n3. Try paper (complete the cycle): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\nGiven they just tied with scissors, they might either continue with it or revert to rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The scissors tie represents their first successful non-rock strategy in a while. They might continue with scissors, which would mean I should play rock for the maximum +3 reward. However, they could also revert to their rock comfort zone.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Rock gives us the best payoff if they continue with scissors, and we've seen they're somewhat predictable in their adaptations.

Yes, that's correct based on my wins.\n\nSo if they want to beat my scissors, they should play rock.

Updated stats:\n- Scissors: 6/17 uses (35%) - now their most frequent move!\n- Rock: 8/17 uses (47%) - no longer majority\n- Paper: 3/17 uses (18%) - stable minority\n\nMajor strategic shift! They've transformed from rock-dominant (75% early game) to scissors-dominant (6 of last 8 rounds = 75% recent usage).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Remarkable evolution! They've completely pivoted their core strategy. Scissors has become their new comfort zone, likely because:\n1. It worked well against my frequent scissors (ties and wins)\n2. It counters rock effectively (which I play sometimes)\n3. They've built confidence through recent scissors success\n\nThree consecutive scissors suggests deep commitment to this new strategy.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** This is now a clear scissors-heavy pattern. They've used scissors 6 times in their last 8 moves, including the current 3-in-a-row streak. The trend is unmistakable.\n\nIf they continue with scissors (very likely): I should play paper (+1 point)\nTheir scissors dominance makes paper the optimal counter-strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The transformation is complete - they've shifted from rock-dominant to scissors-dominant play. The 3-scissors streak after already playing scissors heavily suggests they've fully committed to this new strategy.\n\nPaper continues to be the correct counter to their scissors preference.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Absolutely. The statistical and behavioral evidence both point to continued scissors usage. Paper maximizes my expected value here.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue with paper to counter their strong scissors pattern.\n\n[move] (Opponent now showing 3 scissors in a row and has used scissors 6 times in last 8 rounds - clear pattern shift, continuing to counter with paper) paper"

They likely noticed that I was successfully beating their scissors with paper, so they switched to paper themselves. This creates several possibilities:\n1. They might continue with paper (just had success with tie)\n2. They might return to scissors (their recent preference)\n3. They might cycle to rock (their historical favorite)\n\nThe tie might feel like progress after losing to my paper counter.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** This is a key strategic moment. They've shown they can break patterns when being successfully countered. Their recent moves show:\n- Strong scissors preference (6 of last 9 rounds)\n- Willingness to adapt when countered\n- Paper just worked (tie vs. my counter)\n\nThey might continue with paper, or they might expect me to counter paper and switch back to scissors or rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're clearly learning and adapting!

The immediate return to scissors after paper suggests:\n1. Paper was just a tactical experiment\n2. Scissors is now their true preferred strategy  \n3. They're committed to scissors despite my occasional counters\n4. The scissors ties don't discourage them - they see ties as acceptable outcomes\n\nThis mirrors their original rock obsession, but now with scissors!\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Clear pattern emerging: they've shifted from rock-dominant to scissors-dominant play. The brief paper detour followed by immediate scissors return shows scissors is their new \"comfort zone.\"\n\nRecent evidence strongly suggests continued scissors usage. To beat scissors consistently, I should continue with paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence is overwhelming - they've fully committed to scissors as their new primary strategy. The immediate return to scissors after paper shows where their true preference lies. Just like they used to default to rock, they now default to scissors.\n\nPaper beats scissors, so I should continue countering with paper.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Agreed.
