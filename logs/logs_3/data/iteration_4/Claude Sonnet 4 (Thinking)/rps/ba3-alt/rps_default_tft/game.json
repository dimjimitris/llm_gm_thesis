Scissors beats rock and gives winner 1 point, loser -1 point. So if opponent played scissors and I played rock, they should have won and I should have lost -1 points. That matches what happened.\n\n- Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won and got 1 point. But according to the rules, paper beats scissors giving winner 1 point and loser -1 point. So if I played paper and opponent played scissors, I should win. That matches.\n\nSo the opponent has played scissors twice in a row. This could be:\n1. A pattern they're following\n2. Random coincidence \n3. They might be trying to establish a pattern to then break it\n\nGiven that they played scissors twice, I need to think about what to play next:\n- If they play scissors again, I should play paper (paper beats scissors, +1 point)\n- If they switch to rock, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock, +1 point) \n- If they switch to paper, I should play rock (rock beats paper, +3 points)\n\nSince rock beats paper gives the highest reward (+3 points), and there's a reasonable chance they might switch to paper after playing scissors twice, I think I'll go with rock. But I should also consider that they might stick with scissors, in which case paper would be better.\n\nActually, let me think about this more strategically. They've shown scissors twice. If they're a beginner, they might either:\n1. Stick with what they know (scissors again)\n2. Try to switch to counter what they think I'll do\n\nIf they think I'll play paper to counter their scissors, they might switch to rock. In that case, I should play scissors.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me just pick rock since it has the highest potential payoff.",
