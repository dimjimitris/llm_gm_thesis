      "reasoning_text": "Wait, let me check the rules again:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo I played rock, opponent played scissors. According to the rules, scissors beats rock, so I should have lost and gotten -1 points. But the hint says I lost and scored -1 points, which matches the rules. Wait, that's wrong - if scissors beats rock, then my opponent (who played scissors) should have won and gotten +1 points, while I (who played rock) should have lost and gotten -1 points. That matches what happened.\n\nSo my opponent played scissors in the first round. They're a \"fresh player\" so I don't have much information about their strategy yet. \n\nLet me think about what to play next. If they tend to repeat moves, scissors again would be likely, so I should play rock again to beat scissors. But if they're trying to counter what they think I'll do, they might expect me to play rock again (since it lost) and play paper to beat rock. \n\nSince I don't have much information, I'll go with a different approach. Paper beats scissors and gives +1 points if they play scissors again. If they play rock, I lose -3 points. If they play paper, it's a tie. Given that rock gives the biggest penalty (-3), I should be more cautious about that.\n\nActually, let me think about this more systematically.
