They could:\n- Stick with paper (not learning from the loss)\n- Switch to scissors to try to beat my rock\n- Try rock to copy my winning move\n\nLet me think about the payoff matrix again:\n- Rock beats paper (3 points to winner, -3 to loser)\n- Paper beats scissors (1 point to winner, -1 to loser) \n- Scissors beats rock (1 point to winner, -1 to loser)\n\nIf I think they might play scissors to counter my rock, I should play rock to beat their scissors. Wait, that's wrong - scissors beats rock.\n\nLet me get this right:\n- Rock beats scissors (not paper) - wait, let me re-read the rules.\n\nActually, let me re-read the rules:\n- paper beats scissors (1 point to winner, -1 to loser)\n- rock beats paper (3 points to winner, -3 to loser)  \n- scissors beats rock (1 point to winner, -1 to loser)\n\nSo:\n- If I play rock and they play scissors, scissors wins and I lose 1 point\n- If I play paper and they play scissors, paper wins and I get 1 point\n- If I play scissors and they play rock, scissors wins and I get 1 point\n\nIf I think they might switch to scissors to try to beat my rock (but scissors actually beats rock), then I should play paper to beat their scissors.\n\nBut if they stick with paper, I should play rock again.\nIf they switch to rock (copying me), I should play scissors.\n \nAs a fresh player, they'll likely try to counter my rock with scissors.
