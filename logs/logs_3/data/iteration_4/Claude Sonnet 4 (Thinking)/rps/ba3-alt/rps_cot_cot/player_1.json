    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet.\n\n3. Fresh players might choose randomly or go with their first instinct, making their moves somewhat unpredictable.\n\n4. Calculate expected values assuming random play:\n   - Rock: high reward (+3) but high risk (-3), expected value around -1/3\n   - Paper: moderate risk/reward, expected value around -2/3  \n   - Scissors: balanced risk/reward, expected value around 0\n\n5. Choose the move with the best balance of upside potential and risk management.\n\nSince this is against a fresh player who might be unpredictable, I want to minimize downside risk while still having upside potential. Scissors offers the most balanced profile.\n\n[move] scissors"

Consider opponent's likely psychology after losing: They may switch away from rock since it just lost.\n\n3. Evaluate their probable next moves:\n   - Switch to paper (thinking I might repeat scissors)\n   - Switch to scissors (trying something different)  \n   - Stick with rock (doubling down)\n\n4. Assess my best responses:\n   - If they play paper: rock wins (+3 points - highest reward!)\n   - If they play scissors: rock wins (+1 point)\n   - If they stick with rock: scissors wins (+1 point)\n\n5. Calculate risk/reward: Rock has favorable outcomes in 2 of 3 scenarios, including the high-value +3 scenario against paper.\n\n6. Since fresh players often switch after losing, and paper seems like a logical switch for them, rock offers the best expected value.\n\n[move] rock"

Rock has favorable outcomes in 2 of 3 likely scenarios and no catastrophic downside.\n\n[move] rock"
