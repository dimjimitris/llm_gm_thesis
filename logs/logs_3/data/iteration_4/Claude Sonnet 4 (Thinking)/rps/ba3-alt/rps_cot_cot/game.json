Consider that I'm facing a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet\n3. Many new players tend to start with rock as their first move (it's intuitive and common)\n4. If they choose rock and I choose paper, I get the maximum possible points (+3)\n5. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only risks -1 against scissors, which is better than the -3 risk that comes with playing rock\n\nFinal decision: Paper offers the best risk/reward balance for a first move against an unknown opponent.\n\n[move] paper",

Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential penalty (-3)\n2. Paper and scissors have lower rewards (+1) and lower penalties (-1)\n3. This is not a standard rock-paper-scissors game due to the asymmetric payoffs\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\", I need to think about what they might choose:\n- Fresh players often don't have a strategy yet\n- They might choose randomly\n- They might go with their intuition or a common choice\n\nStrategy considerations:\n1. If I assume random play from opponent: All three moves have the same expected value of 0 (since each has a 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or tying)\n2. However, rock gives me the biggest potential upside (+3) if I win\n3. But rock also gives me the biggest potential downside (-3) if I lose\n\nFor a first move against an unknown player, I should consider:\n- What's the most common first move in rock-paper-scissors? Many people tend to go with rock first\n- If they play rock, and I play paper, I get +3 points\n- If they play paper, and I play rock, I get +3 points  \n\n\n- If they play scissors, and I get -1 points\n\nI'll calculate the expected value for each move carefully. Rock seems promising, with a potential 2/3 point advantage when assuming random play. The nuanced payoff structure means I can't rely on traditional rock-paper-scissors strategies.\n\nConsidering the opponent's likely first move, playing paper appears strategic. If they choose rock - a common initial choice for fresh players - I'll secure a +3 point win. This calculated approach balances probability and potential psychological tendencies.\n\nMy optimal first move: paper.",

The other player chose paper in the first round, same as me\n2. This could mean several things:\n   - They had similar reasoning to mine\n   - They're copying my strategy\n   - They have a preference for paper\n   - It was just coincidence\n\n3.

The key insight is that if they're likely to repeat paper, then scissors would be the optimal counter-move.\n\n5. However, I should also consider that they might be thinking the same way - if they think I'll stick with paper, they might switch to scissors to beat me.\n\n6.

Let me focus on the most likely scenarios:\n\n7. Given that we both played paper in round 1, the most straightforward counter would be scissors (to beat paper).\n8. But they might be thinking the same thing, so they might play scissors too, leading to another tie.\n9. Or they might play rock to beat my expected scissors.\n\n10.

The opponent also chose paper in round 1, which suggests they might be thinking similarly to me - either they also anticipated rock from a \"fresh player\" or they have some strategic reasoning.\n\n2. Now I need to think about what they might do in round 2. They know we both chose paper, so they might:\n   - Stick with paper (thinking it was a good choice)\n   - Switch to rock (thinking I might stick with paper)\n   - Switch to scissors (thinking I might switch to rock)\n\n3. Let me think about the payoff structure again:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1) \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n4.

Actually, let me think about this differently. Since we both chose paper last time, there's a psychological tendency to either:\n   - Repeat the same move (conservative)\n   - Switch to counter what we expect the other to repeat\n   - Try to be unpredictable\n\n6. Given that rock gives the highest reward, and the opponent might anticipate me sticking with paper or switching to rock, scissors could be a good choice because:\n   - If they stick with paper, scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock (high reward play), scissors beats rock (+1)\n   - Only loses to scissors (tie) or if they specifically counter with rock\n\nWait, let me double-check the rules:\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins +1, scissors loses -1)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins +3, paper loses -3)  \n\n\n- scissors beats rock (scissors wins +1, rock loses -1)\n\nI see the strategic complexity now. Rock offers the biggest potential gain but also the biggest risk. The psychological game involves predicting my opponent's next move while managing potential point swings. My choice needs to balance potential reward with strategic uncertainty.\n\nIf they played paper last round, they might choose rock or scissors, which creates interesting strategic scenarios.

They've now played scissors in the last 3 rounds.\n\nLet me think about expected values:\n- If I play rock: 55% chance of +1 (vs scissors), 35% chance of -3 (vs rock), 10% chance of 0 (vs paper) = 0.55*1 + 0.35*(-3) + 0.1*0 = 0.55 - 1.05 = -0.5\n- If I play paper: 55% chance of -1 (vs scissors), 35% chance of +3 (vs rock), 10% chance of 0 (vs paper) = 0.55*(-1) + 0.35*3 + 0.1*0 = -0.55 + 1.05 = +0.5\n- If I play scissors: 55% chance of 0 (vs scissors), 35% chance of +1 (vs rock), 10% chance of +1 (vs paper) = 0.55*0 + 0.35*1 + 0.1*1 = 0.45\n\nSo paper still has the highest expected value at +0.5, followed by scissors at +0.45, then rock at -0.5.\n\nHowever, I notice they've played scissors 3 times in a row now.
