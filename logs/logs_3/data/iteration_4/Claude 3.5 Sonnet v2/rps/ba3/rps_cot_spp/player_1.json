    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also highest risk (-3 points). Rock and scissors have lower risk/reward (\u00b11 point). Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we should consider a balanced approach.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at expected values, if we assume random play from the opponent:\n- Paper: (3 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0.67 expected value\n- Rock: (-3 + 0 + 1)/3 = -0.67 expected value\n- Scissors: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 expected value\nPaper has the highest expected value mathematically.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: In first moves against new players, they often choose Rock as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. This is known as first-move bias. If we assume this psychological tendency, Paper would be the optimal counter.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper has both the highest expected value and counters the likely psychological first move of Rock. The risk is acceptable for the potential reward.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Because it has the highest expected value against random play and counters the common first-move Rock bias.\n"

Stick with the same move, believing in persistence\n2. Switch to what would have beaten their previous move\n3. Switch to what would have lost to their previous move\nOur opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper first, so they're likely to be analytical rather than random.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given they chose paper last time:\n- If they stay with paper: scissors would give us +1\n- If they switch to scissors (to beat our paper): rock would give us +1\n- If they switch to rock (anticipating our scissors): paper would give us +3\nThe most risky but highest reward play would be paper again, but scissors offers a good balance of risk/reward.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors here. Here's why:\n1. It beats paper if they stick to their previous move\n2. It ties with scissors if they try to counter our previous paper\n3. Only loses minimally (-1) if they go with rock\nIt's a balanced choice with positive expected value given the likely scenarios.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree.

If they switch to rock as the psychologist suggests, paper would be our optimal move for +3 points. If they stay with paper, scissors would win again for +1.\n\nGame Strategist: I concur with using paper here because:\n1. It's the optimal counter to the psychologically likely rock\n2. If they stick with paper (less likely after losing), we only lose 1 point\n3. The potential +3 reward outweighs the -1 risk\n3. They've shown a tendency towards paper, suggesting they might avoid it after losing\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Given their consistent initial strategy and subsequent loss, they're likely to make a significant strategy change.

We need to stop the bleeding (-5 points)\n2. They might triple-down on scissors expecting us to overthink\n3. They might switch to paper expecting our rock\n4. Rock is the safest play here because:\n   - Beats scissors if they triple-down (+1)\n   - Ties with rock if they play defensive (0)\n   - Only loses to paper (-3)\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree with rock. After successfully using scissors twice, they might:\n1. Get overconfident and use scissors again\n2. Think we're too sophisticated to play the obvious rock counter\n3. Try to trap us with paper\nRock is psychologically sound as it shows we're willing to make the obvious play rather than overthink.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Because we need to make a strong defensive play against their aggressive scissors streak, and even though it's the obvious counter, sometimes the straightforward play is the right one.\n"

They might expect us to use paper to break the rock tie (like they did after our first rock-rock tie)\n4. But they also know we know about their previous post-rock-tie scissors play\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial decision:\n1. Paper beats rock (+3) but loses to scissors (-1)\n2. Rock ties with rock (0) but loses to paper (-3)\n3. Scissors beats paper (+1) but loses to rock (-1)\n\nGiven their demonstrated ability to:\n- Break patterns when expected\n- Counter our attempts to counter them\n- Think multiple levels ahead\n\nI recommend rock again because:\n1. They might expect us to use paper to beat their rock\n2. This would lead them to use scissors\n3. Rock protects against scissors\n4. At worst, another tie is better than risking more negative points\n5. Breaking serve in this type of mental game often leads to losses\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. They've consistently punished our attempts to make clever moves. Sometimes, maintaining the same move can create psychological pressure on the opponent to change their strategy, potentially making them break first.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Because maintaining our defensive position forces them to decide whether to break the pattern, and given our negative score, we should prioritize protection against further losses over risky gains.\n"

They've completely regained control\n2. They're back to their early-game dominance\n3. They're effectively punishing our predictable responses\n4. Our -9 score shows they've consistently outplayed us\n\nGame Strategist: At this point:\n1. Standard pattern analysis isn't working\n2. They're reading our strategic thinking\n3. We need to accept higher risk for potential reward\n4. Defensive plays have led to our worst losses (-3)\n\nI recommend scissors because:\n1. It's aggressive rather than defensive\n2. Counters their successful paper play\n3. Even if they use rock again, we only lose 1 point\n4. We need to break their momentum\n5. Our worst losses have come from playing rock against their paper\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. Playing defensively has cost us more points than aggressive plays. Scissors shows willingness to take calculated risks while avoiding the big -3 point swings that have hurt us most.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Our -3 point losses from rock vs paper have been more damaging than our -1 point losses from scissors vs rock. The expected value favors the aggressive play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Because defensive play has led to our biggest point losses, and scissors offers a balanced risk/reward ratio while potentially countering their successful paper strategy.\n"

When facing a superior opponent who's reading all our strategic moves, sometimes we need to make plays that don't follow obvious strategic patterns.

The tie gives us a small reset\n2. They've historically punished predictable responses to ties\n3. They might expect us to use paper to counter potential rock\n4. They've shown particular skill at using scissors to punish paper plays\n\nGame Strategist: Critical decision point:\n1. They might expect us to play paper to beat their rock\n2. This would lead them to play scissors\n3. If we play scissors anticipating their paper counter, they might stay with rock\n4. We need to break this cycle of them reading our moves\n\nI recommend rock again because:\n1. Maintains the stable position from the tie\n2. Forces them to decide whether to break the pattern\n3. They might overthink our response to the tie\n4. Sometimes maintaining position creates more uncertainty than changing\n5. If they use paper we lose 3, but we're already far behind and need to try something different\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. Against an opponent who excels at reading our strategic adjustments, sometimes staying put is more unexpected than changing. They might expect us to try to counter their potential moves, making stability the unexpected choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Because maintaining our position after a tie might be more unexpected than trying to counter their potential moves, and forces them to decide whether to break the pattern.\n"
