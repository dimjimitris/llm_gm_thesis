    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Recent history analysis:\n   - Last key sequence:\n     * Round 20: Rock vs Scissors (won +1)\n     * Round 21: Scissors vs Paper (won +1)\n     * Round 22: Rock vs Rock (tie)\n     * Round 23: Paper vs Rock (won +3)\n   - Back to winning after tie!\n\n2. Pattern recognition:\n   - Just won big with paper (+3)\n   - Previous patterns show after paper wins:\n     * Opponents often counter with scissors\n     * We've successfully predicted this before\n     * They lost maximum points (-3)\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   - Opponent just lost maximum points\n   - Their defensive rock failed\n   - Likely to make aggressive counter\n   - May be tilting after big loss\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   - Opponent's likely moves:\n     * Scissors to counter paper (most likely)\n     * Paper to mirror our success\n     * Rock would be too defensive now\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock would:\n     * Beat expected scissors counter (+1)\n     * Be safe against defensive rock (tie)\n     * Only lose to unlikely paper (-3)\n     * Counter their most probable move\n     * Follow our successful pattern of adapting\n\n[move] rock Expecting scissors counter to our paper success\n"
