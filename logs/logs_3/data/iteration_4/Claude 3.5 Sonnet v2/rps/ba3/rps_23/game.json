Psychology for this round:\n   - After a tie, players often change their move\n   - The opponent might expect me to switch\n   - They might switch to scissors expecting me to use paper again\n\n3. Examining possible opponent reactions:\n   - If they stick with paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors: they win (+1/-1)\n   - If they switch to rock: they lose (-3/+3)\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Since paper was predictable last time, staying with it is risky\n   - The opponent might expect rock as a safe choice\n   - Scissors could be effective if they stick with paper\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given the likelihood of opponent switching\n   - And the possibility they'll expect rock from me\n   - Rock provides good defense against expected scissors\n   - Also gives high reward if they choose paper\n\n6.

          "text": "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Complete game history analysis:\n   - Round 20: rock vs scissors (won +1)\n   - Round 21: scissors vs paper (won +1)\n   - Round 22: paper vs rock (won +3)\n   - Round 23: rock vs scissors (won +1)\n   - I'm on an unprecedented eight-game winning streak\n   - Opponent's recent: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n2. Pattern recognition:\n   - Eight perfect reads in a row\n   - They've tried defensive (rock) and aggressive (scissors)\n   - Nothing has worked for them\n   - They keep alternating without strategic thought\n   - Their scissors play shows desperate aggression\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - Eight straight losses is beyond devastating\n   - They're likely in complete psychological meltdown\n   - Strategic thinking has completely broken down\n   - They might be playing purely reactively\n   - Might be in \"anything but what I just did\" mindset\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - After eight straight losses, they're likely to:\n   a) Try paper for maximum potential points\n   b) Use rock as a complete reset\n   c) Use scissors again out of pure tilt\n   - At this point, they might abandon all logic\n\n5. Meta-strategy consideration:\n   - They know I've read every move\n   - They've shown no ability to break their readable patterns\n   - They might try to be unpredictable\n   - But emotional state prevents clear decision-making\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Given their complete breakdown\n   - And desperate need for points\n   - They're most likely to use paper hoping for big score\n   - Scissors provides counter to expected desperate paper play\n\n[move] scissors\n"
