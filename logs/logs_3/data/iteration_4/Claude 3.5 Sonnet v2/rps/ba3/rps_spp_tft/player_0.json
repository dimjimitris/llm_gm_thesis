    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Statistical Analyst - for analyzing patterns and probabilities\n3. Decision Making Expert - for weighing risks and rewards\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first:\n- Paper vs Rock: Best reward (+3)\n- Rock vs Scissors & Scissors vs Paper: Lower reward (+1)\n- Losing with Rock vs Paper: Worst penalty (-3)\n- Losing with Scissors vs Rock & Paper vs Scissors: Lower penalty (-1)\n\nStatistical Analyst: Since we're starting fresh with a new player, we don't have any historical data to analyze patterns. We should consider the expected value of each move.\n\nDecision Making Expert: Given the asymmetric payoffs, paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but moderate risk (-1). Rock has moderate reward potential (+1) but highest risk (-3). Scissors has moderate reward (+1) and moderate risk (-1).\n\nGame Strategist: For an opening move against an unknown opponent, paper is an interesting choice because:\n1. It gives the highest possible reward if successful\n2. If we lose, we only get the smaller penalty\n3. Many players choose rock as their first move in RPS games\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree. The risk-reward ratio for paper is favorable compared to other options.\n\n[move] paper Opening with paper provides the best balance of potential reward (+3) versus risk (-1)\n"

After losing to paper, they are likely to:\n- Either switch to paper to counter our previous move\n- Or switch to scissors expecting us to use paper again\n\nDecision Making Expert: Given this opponent has shown a tendency to use rock (a conservative opening move), they might be a cautious player. Such players often switch to counter the last winning move, making paper risky now.\n\nGame Strategist: If we expect them to switch to either paper or scissors, rock would be our safest play:\n- If they use scissors, we win (+1)\n- If they use paper, we lose (-3)\n- If they stick to rock, we tie (0)\n\nStatistical Analyst: While rock is riskier in terms of potential loss (-3), the probability of the opponent using scissors to counter our previous paper move makes it a reasonable choice.\n\nDecision Making Expert: I agree.

The opponent has likely realized their pattern is being exploited. We should expect a significant strategy change.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we just played scissors:\n1.

Consider:\n1. No rational player would continue this pattern after 5 straight losses\n2. They might finally be setting up a trap\n3. The stakes for them to change strategy have never been higher\n4. They might be trying to bait us into expecting paper\n\nGame Strategist: While their pattern suggests paper next, we need to consider:\n1. The psychological breaking point (5 straight losses is extreme)\n2. The possibility they've been setting up a long-term trap\n3. The likelihood they might revert to rock out of frustration\n\nStatistical Analyst: In extensive game theory studies, players who maintain losing patterns this long typically either:\n1. Finally break the pattern dramatically\n2. Have been setting up a trap\n3.
