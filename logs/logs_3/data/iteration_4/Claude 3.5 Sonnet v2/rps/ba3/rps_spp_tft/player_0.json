    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Risk Analyst: Specialist in evaluating risk-reward scenarios\n3. AI Assistant (me): The player making the final decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors only give 1 point. However, paper also risks the highest loss (-3 points) if countered by rock. Rock and scissors have lower risk-reward profiles (-1/+1).\n\nRisk Analyst: For a first move against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy. In such cases, it's often good to balance potential gains with risk mitigation. Paper is high-risk, high-reward, while rock and scissors are lower-risk options.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest going with rock for the first move. Here's why:\n1. It protects against scissors (most common first move by many players)\n2. Even if we lose to paper, we only lose 3 points instead of risking a bigger early deficit\n3. If they also choose rock, we get a tie and can learn from their first move\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with this conservative first approach. We can adjust our strategy based on the opponent's response in subsequent rounds.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis makes sense. I'll go with rock as my first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock As my first move, I choose rock to maintain a balanced risk-reward profile while gathering information about my opponent's strategy.\n"

Players who lose often switch their strategy, and they might expect us to stick with our winning move.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that we won with rock against scissors, the opponent might:\n1. Expect us to use rock again and counter with paper\n2. Switch to rock themselves to prevent losing to rock again\n3. Stick with scissors hoping we'll switch (least likely given their loss)\n\nGame Strategist: Given these possibilities and that paper gives the highest reward (3 points), I suggest we play paper this round. If they switch to rock as expected, we'll get 3 points. If they go with paper, we tie. The main risk is if they choose scissors, but that seems less likely given their recent loss with it.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. The opponent just lost with scissors, making them less likely to use it again. Their most likely responses are rock or paper, making paper our optimal choice for this round. Even if we lose, we're still net positive from our previous win.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The reasoning is sound.

A tie means neither player gained an advantage, but we gained more information about their behavior.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze what we know:\n1. Round 1: They played scissors (lost)\n2. Round 2: They played paper (tie)\nThis shows they're willing to change strategy and might be trying to predict our moves.\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, they might be thinking:\n1.

Rock provides good coverage against their most likely moves, and even in the worst case (they play paper), we've already accumulated positive points from our first win.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is convincing.

They've returned to scissors despite losing with it in Round 1. This could mean:\n1. They're trying to establish an unpredictable pattern\n2. They might be using a cyclical strategy\n3. They're frustrated from losing and trying to get a quick win\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at our opponent's behavior:\n- They seem to avoid using rock\n- They've used scissors twice (losing both times)\n- They've shown they can switch strategies (paper in round 2)\n- They might be expecting us to switch from our winning rock move\n\nRisk Analyst: Since rock has worked twice against their scissors, they're likely to avoid scissors now. They might:\n1. Finally try rock, expecting us to use paper\n2. Use paper to beat our successful rock strategy\nGiven this, I recommend paper this round. It beats rock if they finally use it, and ties with paper if they try that.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed.

Scissors is optimal because:\n1. It tests if they're committed to mirroring\n2. It has limited downside (-1 vs rock)\n3. It could catch them if they're getting too comfortable with paper\n4.

Following their deterministic cycle, scissors would be next\n\nGame Strategist: Strategic analysis:\n- Ten consecutive identical cycles eliminates any uncertainty\n- Their next move will be scissors with 100% certainty\n- This has become a purely mechanical exercise\n- We are playing against a fixed algorithm\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock is our guaranteed optimal move:\n- If they maintain cycle (scissors): we win (+1)\n- If they somehow break cycle with paper: we lose (-3)\n- If they play rock: we tie (0)\nTen perfect cycles makes this a completely solved situation.\n\nGame Strategist: Completely agree with rock because:\n1. It counters their guaranteed scissors play\n2. We are playing against a perfectly predictable pattern\n3. The risk is theoretical at this point\n4. Any other move would be irrational given perfect information\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is absolute.
