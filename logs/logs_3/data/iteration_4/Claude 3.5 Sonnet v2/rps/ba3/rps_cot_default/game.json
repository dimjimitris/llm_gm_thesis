The last several rounds have heavily featured paper-rock interactions\n2. I'm noticing my opponent often makes calculated rather than aggressive moves\n3. They just lost with rock against my paper\n4. They might be thinking:\n   - I could stick with my winning paper\n   - I might switch to scissors expecting their paper counter\n   - The paper-rock dynamic has become too prominent\n5. Given their generally thoughtful play style, they're likely to try to break this pattern\n\nI'll choose scissors because:\n- If they play paper (either expecting me to stick with paper or as a counter to rock), I win +1\n- If they play rock (to counter my expected scissors), I lose but only -1\n- If they also play scissors (trying to break the paper-rock pattern), it's a tie\n- This move helps break the paper-rock cycle while limiting potential losses\n\n[move] scissors Moving away from the paper-rock dynamic, anticipating either a paper play or a mutual pattern break.\n"

My opponent has lost twice in a row (rock, then paper)\n3. A key pattern I've noticed is that my opponent:\n   - Often makes calculated rather than emotional moves\n   - Frequently tries to counter what they think I'll do next\n   - Sometimes sticks with moves even after losing with them\n4. After losing to scissors, rock would be their straightforward counter\n5. However, they might expect me to predict this and use paper\n\nI'll choose rock because:\n- If they choose scissors (expecting my paper counter to their predicted rock), I win +1\n- If they choose paper (to beat my rock), I lose -3\n- If they choose rock (as a safe play), it's a tie\n- This move anticipates them thinking one level deeper than the obvious counter\n\n[move] rock Expecting them to think beyond the obvious rock counter to my scissors, possibly choosing scissors themselves.\n"
