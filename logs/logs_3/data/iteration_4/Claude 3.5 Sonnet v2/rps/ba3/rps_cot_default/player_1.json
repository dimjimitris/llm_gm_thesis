The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm on a three-win streak (scissors +1, paper +3, paper +3)\n2. My opponent has lost three consecutive rounds, with two big losses\n3. After multiple losses, especially big ones, players often:\n   - Become more aggressive\n   - Try to break patterns forcefully\n   - Make less predictable moves\n4. They've lost twice to paper, making scissors an emotionally appealing choice for them\n5. They might expect me to stick with my winning paper strategy\n\nI'll choose rock because:\n- If they make an aggressive move to scissors (to counter my potential paper repeat), I win +1\n- If they choose rock (as a safe play), it's a tie\n- If they choose paper (expecting me to choose scissors), I lose -3\n- Given their recent losses, they're more likely to make an aggressive move than a calculated one\n\n[move] rock Anticipating an aggressive scissors play to counter my recent paper successes.\n"
