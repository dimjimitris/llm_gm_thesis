First round strategy considerations:\n   - Without knowing opponent's tendencies, a balanced approach might be best\n   - Rock provides good defense against scissors while only risking -3 against paper\n   - Many players tend to choose rock in first rounds due to psychological comfort\n\n5.

Opponent behavior reassessment:\n   - May not be purely fixed-strategy after all\n   - Could have adaptive capabilities that:\n     * Trigger after multiple losses\n     * Take time to activate\n     * Follow some complex pattern\n\n4. Risk analysis for next move:\n   - If opponent is truly adapting:\n     * They might stick with rock (tie)\n     * Switch to paper to counter rock (-3)\n     * Return to scissors (+1)\n   - If previous move was a random deviation:\n     * Likely return to scissors pattern\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - One deviation doesn't invalidate the strong scissors pattern\n   - Could be a temporary adjustment\n   - Need more data to confirm pattern change\n   - Safer to assume return to dominant strategy\n   - Rock remains optimal against scissors\n   - Paper is too risky given history\n\n[move] rock Maintaining rock strategy as one deviation doesn't outweigh the strong historical scissors pattern.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
