    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the risk/reward:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - But Paper also has the highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Rock and Scissors have more balanced outcomes (+1/-1)\n\n4. Since this is the first move:\n   - There's no pattern to analyze\n   - The opponent likely hasn't developed a strategy yet\n   - Playing conservatively might be wise\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock is a balanced choice\n   - It protects against Scissors (win +1)\n   - Against Paper I would lose more (-3)\n   - Against Rock it's a tie (0)\n   - But many players choose Rock as their first move, which would result in a tie\n\n6.

Analyzing last round:\n   - Both players chose paper\n   - This suggests the opponent might be using similar strategic reasoning\n   - They also recognized paper's high reward potential\n\n2. Psychology for this round:\n   - After a tie, players often change their move\n   - The opponent might expect me to switch\n   - They might switch to scissors expecting me to use paper again\n\n3. Examining possible opponent reactions:\n   - If they stick with paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors: they win (+1/-1)\n   - If they switch to rock: they lose (-3/+3)\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Since paper was predictable last time, staying with it is risky\n   - The opponent might expect rock as a safe choice\n   - Scissors could be effective if they stick with paper\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given the likelihood of opponent switching\n   - And the possibility they'll expect rock from me\n   - Rock provides good defense against expected scissors\n   - Also gives high reward if they choose paper\n\n6.

Complete game history analysis:\n   - Round 19: paper vs rock (won +3)\n   - Round 20: rock vs scissors (won +1)\n   - Round 21: scissors vs paper (won +1)\n   - Round 22: paper vs rock (won +3)\n   - I'm on an astonishing seven-game winning streak\n   - Opponent's recent: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n2. Pattern recognition:\n   - Seven perfect reads in a row\n   - They've tried all strategies and failed\n   - They returned to rock as defensive play\n   - Just lost maximum points again\n   - Their play has become completely emotional\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - Seven straight losses is catastrophic\n   - Two recent -3 point losses\n   - They're likely in complete psychological collapse\n   - Might be playing purely on tilt\n   - Might have given up on strategy entirely\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - After seven straight losses, they might:\n   a) Finally snap out of predictable play\n   b) Go completely random\n   c) Use scissors in pure desperation to counter paper\n   - Players at this point often make extreme choices\n\n5. Meta-strategy consideration:\n   - They must know any pattern they show is being read\n   - They've lost with every possible move\n   - They might try anything to break the streak\n   - But emotional state prevents strategic thinking\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Given their complete psychological breakdown\n   - And high likelihood of desperate counter to paper\n   - They're most likely to use scissors aggressively\n   - Rock provides safe counter to expected desperate scissors play\n\n[move] rock\n"

Psychological factors:\n   - Eight straight losses is beyond devastating\n   - They're likely in complete psychological meltdown\n   - Strategic thinking has completely broken down\n   - They might be playing purely reactively\n   - Might be in \"anything but what I just did\" mindset\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - After eight straight losses, they're likely to:\n   a) Try paper for maximum potential points\n   b) Use rock as a complete reset\n   c) Use scissors again out of pure tilt\n   - At this point, they might abandon all logic\n\n5.
