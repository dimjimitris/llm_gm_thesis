    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Paper would be a good counter to this tendency.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper offers the best risk-reward ratio here:\n- If opponent plays Rock (likely), we get 3 points\n- If opponent plays Scissors, we only lose 1 point\n- If opponent plays Paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on risk-reward analysis and common opening move patterns, choosing paper as it offers the highest potential gain while limiting potential losses.\n"

However, they might also think we're thinking the same and stick to their original move. This creates a interesting psychological dynamic.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this situation, I recommend playing rock:\n1. If opponent switches to scissors (expecting us to play paper), we win (1 point)\n2. If opponent keeps paper, we lose but the loss (-3) is just for one round\n3. Most importantly, this move protects against the most likely scenario (opponent switching to scissors)\n\nRisk Analyst: The rock move offers protection against scissors while accepting the risk of paper. Since scissors is a likely next move from our opponent (to counter potential paper play), this seems like a calculated risk worth taking.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. The psychological pressure to change moves after a tie often leads to scissors as it directly counters the previous move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on opponent's demonstrated strategic thinking and the psychological tendency to change moves after a tie, playing rock to counter the likely scissors play.\n"

Second round: rock vs rock\nThis suggests they might be either:\n- Using very similar strategic thinking to us\n- Deliberately mirroring our moves\n- Or possibly predicting our moves very well\n\nRisk Analyst: The pattern so far shows zero points for both players. Looking at the next potential moves:\n- If the pattern of matching continues, we need to consider what they think we'll do\n- The natural progression from rock in standard RPS sequences is often scissors\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Two consecutive ties can create interesting dynamics:\n1. There's increased pressure to break the tie pattern\n2. The opponent has shown they're a thoughtful player\n3. They might be trying to establish a pattern to break it at a crucial moment\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest playing paper:\n1. If they continue the perceived rocky-rock pattern progression to scissors, we lose minimally (-1)\n2. If they stick with rock (attempting to break pattern), we win big (+3)\n3. If they mirror us again, it's another tie (0)\n\nRisk Analyst: The paper play has the best potential upside (+3) with minimal downside risk (-1). Given the opponent's demonstrated strategic approach, they might expect us to play scissors following the common rock-scissors progression.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The psychological tension after two ties might make them more likely to stick with rock, thinking we'll try to be clever with scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper After two consecutive ties and analyzing the opponent's possible strategic thinking, choosing paper as it offers the best risk-reward ratio in this situation.\n"

Overthink and become even more predictable\n2. Become defensive in strategy\n3. Try to find complex patterns where simple ones might work better\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest a change in approach. Instead of complex strategic thinking, let's play scissors:\n1. It's the move we haven't used yet\n2. It's less predictable given our previous patterns\n3. The opponent might expect us to play paper to counter their paper\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. At this point, minimizing potential losses is key. Scissors has the lowest potential loss (-1) if we're wrong, and could win (+1) if we're right.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Yes, and psychologically, introducing randomness might help break the opponent's ability to predict our moves.

If they're thinking multiple levels ahead, they might expect us to play rock to counter their potential scissors\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. The potential high reward (+3) of paper might be worth the risk at this point.
