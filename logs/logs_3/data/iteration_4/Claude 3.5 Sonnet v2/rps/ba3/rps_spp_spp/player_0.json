    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyzer: For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n3. Pattern Observer: For detecting any patterns in opponent's behavior\n4. Decision Maker (AI Assistant - me): For making final move decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff structure. Paper has the highest reward (3 points) when winning against rock, while rock and scissors only give 1 point when winning. However, paper also risks the highest penalty (-3) when losing to rock.\n\nRisk Analyzer: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy. We should consider a balanced approach that manages both potential gains and losses.\n\nPattern Observer: Since this is the first move, we don't have any patterns to analyze yet. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move in RPS games, as it's considered a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, paper would be the optimal move if we expect rock, giving us the highest possible points (3). However, it's also risky as we could lose 3 points if they play scissors.\n\nDecision Maker: Considering all inputs, I think paper is worth the risk here. The potential high reward (3 points) outweighs the risk, and it counters the common first-move rock strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Playing paper as it offers the highest potential reward and counters the common opening move of rock.\n"

They are also using a similar strategic reasoning\n2. They might try to predict our next move based on our first paper play\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie with paper, players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent by predicting their next move. Since we played paper, they might expect us to either:\n- Stick with paper (showing consistency)\n- Switch to scissors (trying to win against their potential paper)\n- Switch to rock (trying to be unpredictable)\n\nRisk Analyzer: Let's analyze the scenarios:\n1. If we play scissors: Win 1 point vs paper, Lose 1 point vs rock, Tie vs scissors\n2. If we play rock: Win 1 point vs scissors, Lose 3 points vs paper, Tie vs rock\n3. If we play paper: Win 3 points vs rock, Lose 1 point vs scissors, Tie vs paper\n\nGame Strategist: Given that our opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper first, they're likely to try to counter our previous move. They might expect us to play paper again and counter with scissors.\n\nDecision Maker: Given this analysis, I think rock is our best move here. Here's why:\n- It beats scissors (which our opponent might play expecting us to use paper again)\n- If they stick with paper, we only lose 3 points (but this is less likely given strategic players tend to adapt)\n- If they play rock, it's a tie\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Playing rock as it counters the likely scissors play from our opponent, who might expect us to stick with paper.\n"

Our opponent has now shown:\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: rock\nThis shows they might be thinking similarly to us, or they're mirroring our moves.\n\nGame Strategist: The fact that we've had two ties in a row suggests our opponent might be using similar strategic reasoning. Given the previous moves and the pattern:\n1. We went from paper \u2192 rock\n2. They went from paper \u2192 rock\nThis suggests both players are thinking along similar strategic lines.\n\nRisk Analyzer: Looking at the current situation:\n1. If they expect us to follow the pattern of \"counter previous move\", they might expect us to play paper (to beat their rock)\n2. If they're using mirror strategy, they might play what we played last (rock)\n3. If they're trying to break the tie pattern, they might play scissors to beat our potential paper\n\nPattern Observer: The two ties suggest we need to break this pattern. Given that we both seem to be thinking similarly, we need to introduce some unpredictability.\n\nGame Strategist: Paper would be the obvious choice to counter their rock, but that might be too predictable. Scissors would be a bold move as it's less obvious.\n\nDecision Maker: I agree with introducing unpredictability. Since both players seem to be thinking strategically, playing the obvious paper might be too predictable. Let's go with scissors - it's the least obvious move and would win against paper if they try to counter our rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Breaking the pattern with scissors to introduce unpredictability and counter potential paper play from opponent.\n"

Our opponent indeed tried to counter our previous rock with paper\n2. They might be using a more straightforward \"counter previous move\" strategy\n3. They haven't shown scissors yet in any round\n\nRisk Analyzer: Given our opponent's latest paper play, they might:\n1. Expect us to stick with scissors (since it worked) and counter with rock\n2. Try scissors themselves (as it's the only move they haven't used)\n3. Return to paper (though less likely after just losing with it)\n\nPattern Observer: Their pattern suggests they might be more reactive than proactive, focusing on countering our previous move rather than predicting our next one.\n\nGame Strategist: If they're indeed focused on countering our previous move (scissors), then rock would be their most logical play. We should consider that they might finally try scissors, as it's their unused move.\n\nDecision Maker: Given this analysis, I recommend paper for these reasons:\n- It beats rock (their most likely move if they're trying to counter our scissors)\n- If they do try scissors for the first time, we only lose 1 point\n- This would be an unexpected move since we just won with scissors\n- The potential 3-point gain outweighs the 1-point loss risk\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Playing paper to counter expected rock, while accepting minimal risk if opponent chooses scissors.\n"

Our opponent has never used scissors in any round\n2. They've lost 4 points in the last two rounds\n3. They might finally use scissors out of necessity to break their losing streak\n4. Their pattern of paper-rock-paper-rock suggests rock could be next, but this might be too predictable for them now\n\nPattern Observer: The fact that they've never used scissors is crucial. After two losses, they're highly likely to finally try it, especially since:\n- It's their unused move\n- It would counter our winning paper play\n- It would break their predictable pattern\n\nGame Strategist: I strongly agree that scissors is their most likely play here. They need to break both their losing streak and their predictable pattern.\n\nDecision Maker: Given this analysis, rock is our best move because:\n- It directly counters the highly probable scissors play from opponent\n- Even if they revert to paper, we only lose 3 points\n- We've won the last two rounds, so we can afford some risk\n- This continues our strategy of staying one step ahead of their thinking\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Playing rock in anticipation of opponent finally using scissors to break their pattern and counter our previous paper play.\n"

They're clearly thinking ahead of our moves\n\nDecision Maker: Let's play rock because:\n- They're likely to play scissors expecting us to counter their rock with paper\n- They've shown they can think multiple steps ahead\n- They're confident enough to make aggressive plays\n- Even if they play paper, we only lose 3 points\n- We need to break their momentum\n- Their recent success might make them more aggressive in their predictions\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Playing rock expecting them to use scissors to counter our expected paper (which would counter their previous rock).\n"
