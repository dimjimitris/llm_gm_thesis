    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic considerations:\n- Many players tend to choose Rock in their first move as it feels \"safe\"\n- If I predict they'll play Rock, Paper would give me the highest reward\n- The risk of playing Paper (losing 1 point to Scissors) is less than the potential reward (gaining 3 points against Rock)\n\n5. Decision weighing:\n- Given the higher reward potential\n- And the common tendency for first-time players to choose Rock\n- The reward/risk ratio favors Paper\n\nFinal decision: I will play Paper\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyzing recent game history:\n- Round 8: Both Scissors (tie)\n- Round 9: Their Scissors beat my Paper (-1)\n- Round 10: My Rock beat their Scissors (+1)\n- Round 11: Both Scissors (tie)\n- Remarkably, they've now played Scissors FOUR times in a row\n\n2. Pattern deep dive:\n- Their Scissors streak is highly unusual\n- Even after losing with Scissors, they returned to it\n- This could indicate:\n  * A very stubborn strategy\n  * Random play\n  * Or an attempt to be unpredictable through predictability\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n- Playing the same move four times in a row is extreme\n- They must realize this pattern is obvious\n- Therefore:\n  * They might finally break this pattern\n  * They might be trying to condition me to expect Scissors\n  * They could be setting up for a surprise move\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n- Five Scissors in a row would be highly improbable\n- After such a long Scissors streak, they almost must switch\n- Most likely switches would be:\n  * Rock (defensive, beats Scissors)\n  * Paper (completely different approach)\n- Rock is more likely as it beats their previous pattern\n\n5. Risk/reward evaluation:\n- If they finally switch to Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n- If they somehow play Scissors again: Rock wins (+1)\n- If they play Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n- The probability of another Scissors play seems very low\n- Rock seems their most logical choice to break pattern\n\nFinal decision: Given the extreme unlikelihood of a fifth consecutive Scissors play, and the high probability they'll switch to Rock to both break their pattern and counter potential Scissors, I will play Paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Critical pattern analysis:\n- I falsely assumed they wouldn't play Scissors again\n- They've maintained Scissors despite:\n  * Losing with it\n  * Tying with it\n  * Winning with it\n- This is either remarkable commitment or a very specific strategy\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n- Their commitment to Scissors is beyond normal strategy\n- This could be:\n  * A psychological experiment\n  * A test of my adaptability\n  * A very simple but effective strategy banking on my overthinking\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n- Basic game theory suggests they must eventually switch\n- However, I've thought this for several rounds now\n- They've won twice with Scissors against my Paper\n- They've only lost once with Scissors (against Rock)\n\n5.

            "text": "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Analyzing recent game history:\n- Round 20: Both Scissors (tie)\n- Round 21: My Rock beat their Scissors (+1)\n- Round 22: Their Paper beat my Rock (-3)\n- Round 23: Both Paper (tie)\n- Recent trend shows more ties and strategic switches\n\n2. Deeper pattern analysis:\n- Early game: They used long sequences\n- Mid game: They switched to counter patterns\n- Recent game: More dynamic/reactive play\n- We seem to be matching moves more often now\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n- The game has evolved from pattern-based to more tactical\n- They've demonstrated:\n  * Ability to use patterns as bait\n  * Good timing on strategic switches\n  * Willingness to match moves (ties)\n  * Adaptability in their strategy\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n- After mutual Paper play:\n  * They might expect Scissors from me\n  * They might try to continue Paper sequence\n  * They could switch to Rock anticipating Scissors\n  * Or they might try to match my move again\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n- If they play Paper again: Scissors wins (+1)\n- If they switch to Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n- If they switch to Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n- Key consideration: They've become more unpredictable and strategic\n\nFinal decision: Since they've shown increasing strategic sophistication and we just had a Paper tie, they likely expect me to play Scissors to counter Paper. To counter their probable Rock (which would beat expected Scissors), I will maintain Paper. This also protects against them trying to continue a Paper sequence.\n\n[move] paper\n"
