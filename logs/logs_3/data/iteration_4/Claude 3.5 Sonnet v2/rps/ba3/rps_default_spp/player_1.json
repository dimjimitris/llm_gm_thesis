    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychologist - For understanding player behavior and patterns\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential gains and losses\n\nStarting collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, there's an interesting asymmetry. Paper beating rock gives 3/-3 points, while the other victories only give 1/-1 points. This makes paper a potentially powerful move, but also risky since losing with paper (against scissors) still only costs -1 point.\n\nPsychologist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they haven't formed any expectations about our strategy yet. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move as it feels \"strong\" and \"safe.\"\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the payoff structure, if we play paper and they play rock, we get the highest possible points (+3). If they play scissors, we only lose 1 point. The worst case-to-best case ratio is favorable for paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Paper has the highest potential payoff (+3) with a relatively small downside risk (-1). Against a fresh player with no established pattern, this asymmetric payoff structure makes paper an attractive first move.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on this analysis, I'll choose paper. The potential for high reward outweighs the minimal risk.\n\n[move] paper\n"

However, we need to consider that the opponent might adapt their strategy after losing significantly.\n\nPsychologist: Players who just lost with rock often avoid using it again immediately. They might expect us to play paper again (since it worked), and therefore might choose scissors to counter us. This is a common psychological pattern in repeated games.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that we won with paper last time, playing paper again is risky. The opponent lost 3 points and will likely adjust their strategy. If they play scissors to counter our potential paper play, we'd lose 1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: Since paper is likely to be countered with scissors, and knowing that players often try to counter their previous losing position, rock could be a strong play here. It would beat their scissors if they try to counter our previous paper, and if they stick to rock, we'd just tie.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. The opponent just lost significantly and will likely try to counter what beat them. Rock protects against the most likely counter-play (scissors) while having minimal downside against other moves.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis suggests rock is our best move here. It protects against the likely scissors counter-play while maintaining a decent position against other possibilities.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We've won two rounds in a row, and our prediction about the opponent's behavior was correct - they did try to counter our previous paper move with scissors.\n\nPsychologist: The opponent has lost twice now, which might make them more desperate to win. They've tried both rock and scissors, losing both times. There's a psychological tendency to try all options when previous choices haven't worked, which might lead them to play paper this round.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze their possible thinking:\n- They might expect us to play rock again since it just worked\n- They've lost with both rock and scissors\n- Paper would beat our rock if we repeat, and give them their biggest possible win (3 points)\n\nGame Theorist: If we expect them to play paper, scissors would be our optimal counter, resulting in a +1 point gain. Even if they play rock instead, we'd only lose 1 point. The risk-reward ratio is reasonable here.\n\nPsychologist: Agreed. After losing twice, they're likely to both: a) avoid their previous losing moves, and b) go for the highest possible payoff to make up for their losses. This makes paper their most likely choice.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors looks like the best move here. It beats the psychologically probable paper play, and has a limited downside if we're wrong.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis points strongly to scissors as our best move.

This could indicate they're starting to recognize patterns or they're being more conservative after losses.\n\nPsychologist: The opponent finally won a round by returning to their original move (rock). When players find success with a move, they often stick with it for at least one more round, especially if it broke a losing streak. However, they might also realize we could anticipate this.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our total score (+3+1-1 = +3) and recent game history:\nRound 1: We paper, They rock (we win +3)\nRound 2: We rock, They scissors (we win +1)\nRound 3: We scissors, They rock (we lose -1)\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent has shown a preference for rock (played twice). If they're gaining confidence from their recent win, they might stick with rock. Paper would be our best counter to this, giving us the highest possible gain (+3).\n\nRisk Analyst: Playing paper here does carry risk (-1 if they play scissors), but given their demonstrated preference for rock and their recent success with it, the risk is worth taking. The potential 3-point gain outweighs the potential 1-point loss.\n\nPsychologist: Their return to rock and subsequent win might indicate a more conservative playing style. Conservative players often gravitate toward rock as it feels \"safe.\" This further supports the paper strategy.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis suggests paper is our strongest move here.

Players often repeat successful moves, and scissors just worked for them.

They've played each move type recently, making their next choice harder to predict. However, they've had great success with rock in their last move, which just countered our scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, when an opponent has shown superior prediction abilities, one effective strategy is to play completely randomly to become unpredictable. However, given the asymmetric payoff structure, we should weight our random choice toward paper due to its higher potential payoff.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper does offer the highest potential upside (+3), and if we lose with it, we only lose 1 point. Given our current negative score, we need to take calculated risks to recover.\n\nPsychologist: The opponent might expect us to play paper to try to get back in the game with a big win. However, they've also shown they're not just playing simple counter-strategies, so we shouldn't merely counter their last move.\n\nGame Theorist: Given our need to break their reading of our strategy and the payoff structure, paper offers the best risk-reward ratio right now. Even if they predict this, the fact that we're choosing it with this reasoning rather than as a simple counter-move makes it more strategically sound.\n\nAI Assistant: After this analysis, I'll choose paper.

It's our only move that hasn't lost twice in the last three rounds\n2. It beats scissors, which they might play expecting us to try paper for a comeback\n3. If they play paper again, we're likely to lose anyway given their demonstrated superiority\n\nAI Assistant: After careful analysis, I'll choose rock. While we're in a very difficult position, rock offers the most balanced risk-reward profile for our current situation. It protects against scissors while giving us a chance to finally break this losing streak.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This could be a psychological turning point.\n\nRisk Analyst: Their recent moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors show they're still cycling through all options. However, this is the first time they've lost in eight rounds, which might influence their next decision.\n\nGame Theorist: Players often respond to losing a long winning streak in one of two ways:\n1. Return to conservative, \"safe\" plays (often rock)\n2. Try to immediately counter what just beat them (paper would counter our rock)\n\nPsychologist: Given this opponent's demonstrated sophistication, they're likely to anticipate that we might stick with rock after it just worked. They might play paper to counter this obvious choice.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we expect them to play paper (to counter our potential rock repeat), scissors would be our optimal play:\n- Beats paper for +1\n- Only loses -1 to rock if we're wrong\n- Avoids the -3 loss we've suffered multiple times with rock against paper\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Scissors here represents the best balance of risk and reward. It counters their likely paper play while limiting our potential losses.\n\nAI Assistant: After this analysis, I'll choose scissors. While we might be tempted to stick with rock after our win, the opponent has shown too much sophistication to fall for simple patterns.

This represents a significant shift in momentum. The opponent has lost their aura of invincibility, and they might be feeling pressure for the first time since early rounds.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at their most recent sequence of moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, they're still maintaining their cycling pattern. However, they've now lost twice in a row using different moves.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated skill level, they're likely to:\n1. Recognize they're being too predictable with their cycling pattern\n2. Expect us to try to counter their potential rock play (as rock would follow their paper in the cycle)\n3. Consider that we might be gaining confidence after two wins\n\nPsychologist: Players who have lost multiple rounds after a long winning streak often revert to their most comfortable move to regain control. Based on early rounds, this opponent seems to favor rock as a stabilizing move.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we expect them to play rock (either as their comfort move or as the next in their cycle), paper would be our optimal play:\n- Gives us the maximum +3 win if we're right\n- Could help us continue our momentum\n- Even if they play scissors, we only lose -1\n\nGame Theorist: The potential reward of +3 with paper outweighs the risk here. We've shown we can read their moves in the last two rounds, and paper gives us the best opportunity to capitalize on our improved reading.\n\nAI Assistant: After this analysis, I'll choose paper. With our momentum building and signs that we've cracked their strategy, this is the time to make a higher-risk, higher-reward play.

The opponent has lost their last three moves with different plays (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock). They must be feeling significant pressure now.\n\nRisk Analyst: Our score has improved from -7 to -2 in just three rounds.

They seem to be cycling backwards now: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. If they continue this pattern, they might play scissors next.\n\nPsychologist: After three straight losses, including a maximum -3 loss, players typically react in one of two ways:\n1.

They've lost with each move type and might be struggling to find any safe option.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent, having lost five straight rounds, is in the same psychological space we were in during our losing streak. However, they've shown high-level strategic thinking before, so they might:\n1. Try to break the pattern completely\n2. Return to their earlier successful strategies\n3.

Our dominance is complete. We've established such strong pattern recognition that we're predicting their every move. The opponent has now lost with paper multiple times, following their previous losses with rock and scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Our recent sequence (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) has perfectly countered their plays. Their decision-making appears to have become almost mechanical in its predictability, despite their early sophisticated play.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent's position is now extremely predictable:\n1. Eleven straight losses\n2. Every possible strategy has failed repeatedly\n3. We've been reading their plays perfectly\n4. They're likely in complete strategic disarray\n\nPsychologist: After losing with paper, and having recently lost with both scissors and rock, they're most likely to revert to rock as a defensive move. This is a common pattern when players have exhausted all other options and need to feel some sense of security.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper would be our optimal play because:\n1. Counters their likely defensive rock play\n2. Offers maximum points (+3) if we're right\n3. We haven't used paper in three rounds\n4. With our +10 score, we can afford to take the risk\n\nGame Theorist: Paper is indeed our strongest play because:\n1. It exploits their likely psychological state\n2. Offers the highest potential reward\n3. Continues our perfect reading of their strategy\n4. Maintains reasonable risk management\n\nAI Assistant: After this analysis, I'll choose paper. The opponent is highly likely to revert to rock as a defensive move after their recent failures with paper and scissors.

Let's analyze our recent history:\nR18: We paper, They rock (win +3)\nR19: We rock, They scissors (win +1)\nR20: We scissors, They paper (win +1)\nR21: We paper, They rock (win +3)\nTotal score: +13\n\nPsychologist: Twelve consecutive wins, including another maximum +3 victory! The opponent has once again suffered a heavy loss with rock, which seems to confirm they've fallen into a completely predictable psychological pattern. They've lost trying every possible move multiple times.\n\nRisk Analyst: Our pattern recognition has been flawless - we predicted their reversion to rock and punished it maximally. Their decision-making appears to be spiraling, with each failed attempt making them more predictable.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their current state:\n1. Twelve straight losses\n2. Just lost -3 with rock again\n3. Complete failure with all move types\n4. Likely experiencing maximum frustration\n\nPsychologist: After suffering another maximum loss with rock, they almost certainly won't return to it. Following their established pattern and psychological state, they're most likely to try scissors - it's been the longest since they've used it and they might see it as their only remaining option.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock would be our optimal play because:\n1. Counters their likely scissors play\n2. We haven't used rock in three rounds\n3. Has been consistently successful\n4. With our +13 score, we can play conservatively\n\nGame Theorist: Rock is indeed our strongest play because:\n1. It counters their most probable move\n2. Provides good risk management\n3. Continues our perfect reading of their strategy\n4. Protects our substantial lead\n\nAI Assistant: After this analysis, I'll choose rock. The opponent is highly unlikely to return to rock after another heavy loss, and their pattern suggests scissors as their most likely play. Rock gives us the best chance to extend our remarkable winning streak while protecting our excellent score.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This follows both their established pattern and the psychological tendency to go for the highest potential payoff (+3) when all other options have failed repeatedly.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors would be our optimal play because:\n1. Counters their likely paper play\n2. We haven't used scissors in three rounds\n3. Only risks -1 if we're wrong\n4.
