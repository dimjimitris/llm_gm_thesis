    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when winning against rock\n- Rock and scissors have lower rewards (1 point) when winning\n- Paper also has the lowest penalty (-3 points) when losing\n- Rock and scissors have lower penalties (-1 point) when losing\n\nGiven this analysis, I'll choose paper as it offers the highest potential reward, though it does come with higher risk. Paper beats rock for a significant 3-point gain, and if my opponent chooses scissors, while I'll lose 1 point, it's not as devastating.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Round 13: They scissors, I paper (I lost -1)\n\nTheir pattern: paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors\nMy pattern: paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper\nMy current score: +1 point total\n\nKey observations:\n- They've now used scissors five times in a row!\n- They've won twice in a row with it\n- My paper plays have been unsuccessful\n- This is an extremely aggressive and unusual strategy\n\nGiven:\n1. Five scissors in a row is an extreme strategy\n2. They've had success with it\n3. But it's becoming very predictable\n4. They might think I'll try paper again expecting them to finally switch\n\nThis time, I'm going to directly counter their scissors streak with rock. Even if they finally switch to paper, I'd only lose 3 points, but if they stick with scissors again, I'll win.\n\n[move] rock\n"
