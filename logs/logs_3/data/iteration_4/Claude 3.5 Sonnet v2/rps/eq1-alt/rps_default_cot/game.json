Risk analysis:\n- Playing paper has lost multiple times to rock\n- Playing scissors keeps resulting in ties\n- Need to break this cycle\n- Must avoid being predictable\n\n5. Strategic conclusion:\n- Despite history suggesting they might play rock after scissors tie\n- They've shown they can read this expectation\n- They might expect scissors again and match it\n- Rock would be unexpected after scissors-scissors tie\n- Rock beats scissors if they stay with scissors\n- Rock ties rock if they go back to their power move\n\n[move] rock (Breaking pattern with unexpected move that can't lose to their successful strategies)\n"
