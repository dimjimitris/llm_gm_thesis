    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Their sequence: paper, paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock. They're showing sophisticated adaptation and prediction of my counter-moves.\n\n[move] scissors I've lost several rounds trying to predict their next move, so I'll try a different approach. Since they just won with rock, they might expect me to use paper to counter it, in which case they'd use scissors. By using scissors myself, I'd tie if they think that way, win if they try paper, and lose if they stick with rock.\n"

I'll simplify my approach and use rock, which would win against their last move (paper) and has historically been effective against their paper preference.
