    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and prediction\n3. AI Assistant (me) - For making final decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when playing against an unknown opponent, it's often best to start with a balanced approach. Each move has equal chances of winning, losing, or tying in Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Without any prior knowledge of the opponent's tendencies, going with any pre-conceived bias could be exploitable. However, there's an interesting psychological aspect: many players tend to choose Rock as their first move, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" This is a documented tendency in RPS games.\n\nGame Strategist: That's an interesting point. If there's a slight tendency for new players to choose Rock first, then Paper would be the optimal counter. However, we should be careful about over-relying on such heuristics.\n\nAI Assistant: Both insights are valuable. Given that there's a slight psychological tendency for players to choose Rock first, and considering that Paper is a safe counter to that while not being severely punished if we're wrong, I'll go with Paper.\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move against a new player, I'm choosing paper as it could counter the common tendency of players choosing rock first, while still maintaining a balanced position in the game.\n"

They might expect us to choose rock in this round as a response to their scissors\n2. They might stick to scissors since it worked for them last time\n3. They might switch to rock to beat our paper\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who lose a round often change their strategy. After losing with scissors, they might be hesitant to use it again. Also, since we won with paper, they might expect us to stick with a winning move, which could lead them to choose scissors again to counter it.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these considerations, choosing rock would be a good move. It would:\n- Beat scissors if they stick to their previous move\n- Beat paper if they try to counter our previous move\n- Only lose to scissors, which they just lost with and might be hesitant to use again\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with this analysis. Using rock provides good coverage against likely opponent moves while accounting for psychological factors of loss aversion.\n\n[move] rock Based on the previous round's outcome and likely opponent adaptations, rock provides strong strategic coverage against probable moves.\n"

Ties often create interesting psychological dynamics in RPS\n3. We now have two rounds of data: scissors \u2192 rock progression\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often feel a need to \"break the deadlock.\" There are two common psychological patterns:\n1. Some players maintain the same move, believing their opponent will change\n2. Others try to \"get ahead\" of their opponent by making one step ahead in the RPS cycle\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we've seen scissors \u2192 rock from them, there might be a pattern forming. If they're thinking strategically, they might expect us to use paper to beat their rock, leading them to choose scissors. However, if they're playing more reactively, they might stick with rock after the tie.\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie might make them more likely to change their move, as ties can feel unsatisfying. Given their previous moves showed willingness to change strategy, they're likely to switch again.\n\nAI Assistant: Considering both the strategic and psychological aspects, I think they're likely to switch to scissors to try to \"break the tie\" and counter our potential paper play. Therefore, I'll choose rock again.\n\n[move] rock After the tie, anticipating our opponent will try to get ahead by switching to scissors to counter our potential paper play, rock remains our best option.\n"

However, there's another psychological factor at play: they might feel they've \"figured us out\" after their win, which could lead to overconfidence. Also, success with scissors might make them more likely to stick with it.\n\nGame Strategist: If they're following the pattern strictly (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), they should play rock next. However, their win with scissors might break this pattern. We need to consider:\n1. They might stick with scissors after success\n2. They might follow their pattern and go rock\n3. They might try to be unpredictable and use paper\n\nPsychology Expert: The win likely gives them confidence in scissors, but they've also shown they're willing to switch moves strategically. However, paper has been notably absent from their play so far, suggesting they might be uncomfortable with it.\n\nAI Assistant: Given that they've won with scissors and might be feeling confident, but also considering their shown pattern and the absence of paper in their gameplay, I think paper is our best move here. It protects against a rock play (if they follow their pattern), and if they do stick with scissors from their winning move, we'll only lose what we just lost anyway. Plus, they haven't shown any tendency to use paper themselves.\n\n[move] paper Anticipating either a return to their pattern with rock, or continued scissors use, paper gives us good strategic coverage while introducing a new element to our own play.\n"

They've now lost twice with scissors, but also won once with it. Their emotional state might be complex:\n1. Frustration from just losing again with scissors\n2. Memory of recent success with scissors\n3. Possible tilt (emotional decision-making) after losing\n4. Still haven't used paper at all in the game\n\nGame Strategist: Their complete avoidance of paper is becoming a strong pattern. Also, they seem to have abandoned their earlier rock-scissors alternation in favor of sticking with scissors. When players get frustrated, they often either:\n1. Completely change their strategy (might finally try paper)\n2. Double down on their previous move out of stubbornness\n3. Return to what felt \"safe\" earlier (rock)\n\nPsychology Expert: After consecutive losses with the same move, most players will feel strong pressure to change their strategy. The fact that they haven't used paper at all might actually make it more likely now - players often save certain moves as \"surprise\" elements.\n\nAI Assistant: Given this analysis, I believe they're most likely to finally change their strategy. Between their options, rock feels most likely as it's their only move that hasn't lost twice, and they've had success with it (the tie). While they might finally try paper, protecting against rock seems more important given their history.\n\n[move] paper Given their likely frustration with scissors and previous comfort with rock, paper provides protection against their most probable strategic shift while maintaining our unpredictability.\n"

They've just experienced success with switching strategies, which validates their decision to change moves. This successful adaptation might encourage them to:\n1. Stick with rock after the win (similar to their scissors persistence)\n2. Feel more confident about switching moves in general\n3. Complete the transition through all three moves by finally trying paper\n\nGame Strategist: Their play pattern has been quite reactive. When they win, they've shown a tendency to stick with the winning move (as seen with scissors). However, they're also demonstrating better adaptability now. \n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological momentum is with them after this win. Players often feel most unpredictable and confident after a successful strategy change. However, they've also shown a pattern of sticking with winning moves until they lose with them.\n\nAI Assistant: Given their demonstrated pattern of sticking with winning moves, and that they've just had success moving away from scissors to rock, I think they're likely to stick with rock. While they might feel empowered to try paper finally, their pattern of move persistence after wins is more established.\n\n[move] scissors Anticipating they'll stick with their winning rock move, scissors provides a strong counter while also protecting against a potential first-time paper play.\n"

They've:\n1. Lost with their recent \"adaptation\" to rock\n2. Still never used paper throughout the entire game\n3. Experienced multiple losses with both scissors and rock\n4. Might be feeling frustrated or backed into a corner\n\nGame Strategist: This could be the moment they finally try paper. Consider:\n1. Their other strategies have failed recently\n2. They might feel they've become predictable\n3. Paper is their only unused move\n4. They might view paper as their \"secret weapon\"\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. When players have exhausted their comfort moves and faced losses, they often resort to their unused options. The psychological pressure to try something completely new is very high at this point.\n\nAI Assistant: The combination of recent loss, pattern recognition (they might realize we've figured them out), and having never used paper makes this the highest probability we've seen for them to finally use paper. Their previous patterns of sticking with scissors or rock have both led to losses, which should push them toward trying their unused option.\n\n[move] scissors While they're most likely to finally try paper, we can't completely discount their possible return to rock. Scissors gives us coverage against rock while accepting the risk of losing to their potential first paper play, as they've been reluctant to use paper throughout the entire game.\n"

However, they've also shown they can adapt and might realize we'll expect them to stick with paper.

However, this could lead to two very different reactions:\n1. Stick with paper due to recency bias and success\n2. Try to stay one step ahead by anticipating our counter to paper\n\nAI Assistant: Given their history of initially sticking with successful moves, combined with the psychological reward of finally using paper successfully, I think they're likely to stay with paper for at least one more round.

Breaking their pattern of switching after losses suggests they might be tilting\n2. They might be frustrated that their \"new\" strategy failed\n3. The fact that they stuck with paper even after losing suggests they're becoming less predictable\n4. They might be second-guessing their own patterns\n\nGame Strategist: Their gameplay has evolved significantly from the early rounds:\n1. Initially alternated between scissors and rock\n2. Then showed tendency to stick with winning moves\n3. Finally introduced paper\n4. Now breaking their own patterns by sticking with paper after a loss\n\nPsychology Expert: This break in pattern is crucial. It could mean:\n1. They're becoming more random/unpredictable\n2. They're trying to establish a new pattern to confuse us\n3. They're frustrated and not thinking as strategically\n4. They might be trying to make us overthink their strategy\n\nAI Assistant: Given this significant break in their established patterns, we need to be more cautious about prediction.

Their history suggests they rarely stick with a move after two consecutive losses, and they've shown increased adaptability in recent rounds.\n\n[move] scissors Given their likely switch away from paper after two losses with it, and their historical comfort with rock, scissors provides good coverage while continuing our own unpredictable play.\n"

Their confidence from their previous paper win might have made them overcommit\n4. They might be getting frustrated with their recent loss\n\nGame Strategist: Their recent behavior shows:\n1. Less responsiveness to losses than earlier in the game\n2. More commitment to specific moves (paper recently)\n3. Moving away from their earlier quick switches after losses\n4. Possible regression to more predictable patterns\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological state after consecutive losses with the same move is usually strong:\n1.

In these situations, players often revert to comfort moves - for them, that's historically been scissors or rock.\n\n[move] rock Since they're likely to abandon paper after two losses, and given their historical comfort with scissors (their original go-to move), rock provides protection against their most probable switch while also covering against a stubborn stick to paper.\n"

Their gameplay has shown that while they might stick with a move after one loss, they rarely continue after multiple losses with the same move.\n\nWhen they switch from scissors, they've historically favored rock over paper (as seen in the early game pattern).

Their recent losses might push them toward a major strategy change\n\nGame Strategist: Key observations:\n1. They haven't used paper in several rounds\n2.

Might be getting frustrated and prone to bigger strategic shifts\n\nAI Assistant: They've now shown a pattern of sticking with moves after initial losses but eventually switching when the losses accumulate.

When players reach this state (multiple losses, becoming predictable), they often make dramatic strategy changes.\n\nGiven that they haven't used paper in a while, and their recent rock-scissors plays have resulted in losses, they might see paper as a fresh start or surprise element.

Successfully broke previous tie sequence with scissors\n3. Their play has become highly sophisticated\n4. They've demonstrated ability to predict our adaptations\n\nPsychology Expert: Current psychological pressures:\n1. Growing urgency to break another tie sequence\n2. May feel trapped in a pattern of ties\n3. Previous success breaking ties with aggressive plays\n4. Might be looking for another decisive winning move\n\nAI Assistant: This situation parallels their recent experience with multiple ties, but with an important difference - they successfully broke the last tie sequence with scissors and won, only to fall back into another tie. Given their demonstrated sophistication and previous success breaking ties with unexpected moves, they're likely to attempt another pattern break.\n\nLast time they broke a tie sequence, they used scissors successfully. They might reason that we'll expect a similar aggressive play, making rock our likely counter. This would make paper their optimal choice - it would beat our anticipated rock while completely breaking from the scissors pattern.\n\n[move] rock While they might maintain scissors out of stubbornness or switch to rock thinking we'll expect paper, rock provides our best coverage here. It:\n1. Beats scissors if they maintain their current move\n2. Ties against their potential rock play\n3. Loses to paper if they make that sophisticated choice\n\nGiven their recent strategic sophistication and success with breaking patterns, we accept the risk of them choosing paper, as breaking the scissors pattern with another aggressive play (rock) seems more aligned with their recent psychological state and gameplay patterns.\n"

Might feel overthinking led to their defeat\n3. Could return to more comfortable, aggressive plays\n4. May want to quickly recover from the loss\n\nAI Assistant: After their sophisticated paper play failed, they're at a psychological crossroads. Players often simplify their strategy after losing with a complex play, returning to more basic, aggressive options. In their case, scissors has been their most frequent \"comfort move\" throughout the game, especially in early rounds.\n\nTheir paper play showed they were thinking multiple levels ahead, but its failure might make them doubt this approach. When players experience this kind of strategic defeat, they often revert to more direct, aggressive plays rather than trying another complex strategy.\n\n[move] rock Given the likelihood they'll revert to a more aggressive, straightforward strategy (likely scissors) after their sophisticated play failed, rock provides our best coverage. While they might try another complex play with paper or attempt to counter our rock with rock, their psychological state suggests a return to their comfort move of scissors is most likely. The risk of them choosing paper again right after it failed seems lower than usual.\n"

Their historical pattern suggests they might stick with scissors after a win, but their demonstrated sophistication throughout the game shows they understand the risks of becoming predictable.\n\nConsidering they just won with scissors after we played rock, they might anticipate we'll switch to paper to counter potential repeated scissors. This would make rock their optimal counter-play to our expected paper.\n\n[move] scissors While they might stick with scissors following their win (their historical pattern) or switch to paper to surprise us, scissors gives us the best strategic coverage. It:\n1. Ties if they maintain scissors\n2. Beats paper if they try a surprise switch\n3. Loses to rock if they make that sophisticated counter-play\n\nGiven their demonstrated ability to think ahead and their success with mixing aggressive and sophisticated plays, protecting against paper while accepting a tie with scissors seems more prudent than trying to counter a potential rock play.\n"

Maintained scissors after win but achieved only a tie\n2. Might feel their scissors strategy is becoming too predictable\n3. Recent history shows success with both straightforward and complex plays\n4. The tie might create pressure to break from scissors pattern\n\nGame Strategist: Strategic considerations:\n1.

May feel we've \"figured out\" their current strategy\n3. Previous success with surprise moves might influence decision\n4. Might want to regain strategic initiative after tie\n\nAI Assistant: After three consecutive scissors plays (win-tie-tie), they're likely feeling strong pressure to switch strategies. Their sophisticated gameplay throughout the match shows they understand the risks of becoming predictable, and they've previously demonstrated success with well-timed strategic shifts.\n\nThe most obvious counter to their scissors pattern would be rock, which they might expect us to play. This would make paper their optimal choice - it would beat our anticipated rock while completely breaking their scissors pattern. Additionally, they've shown comfort with paper earlier in the game when breaking patterns.\n\n[move] scissors Despite the risk of appearing predictable ourselves, scissors provides our best coverage in this situation. Here's why:\n1. If they maintain scissors (unlikely after three consecutive plays), we tie\n2. If they switch to paper (their sophisticated play), we win\n3. If they switch to rock (countering our expected paper), we lose\n\nGiven their demonstrated sophistication and the obvious telegraphing of their scissors pattern, they're most likely to make a dramatic switch. Between rock and paper, paper represents the more sophisticated choice (beating our expected rock), making scissors our best play despite its apparent predictability.\n"
