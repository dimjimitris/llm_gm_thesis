    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Keep scissors expecting another tie or thinking I'll switch to paper\n2. Switch to rock to beat the scissors if they think I'll stick with it\n3. Switch to paper thinking I might use rock to counter potential scissors\n\nThe opponent has shown improved adaptability in recent rounds, breaking out of their previous predictable patterns. After ties, players often try to gain an advantage by predicting their opponent's change in strategy.\n\n[move] rock Since they've become more strategic and just tied with scissors, they might stick with scissors thinking I'll switch to paper, or use paper thinking I'll use scissors again. Rock beats scissors and ties with rock if they try to counter my expected scissors play.\n"
