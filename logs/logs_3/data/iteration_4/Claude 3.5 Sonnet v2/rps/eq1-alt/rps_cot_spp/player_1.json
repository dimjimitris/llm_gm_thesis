    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior and adapting strategies\n3. Risk Assessor - For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In such cases, it's best to start with a balanced approach. All moves have equal winning and losing potential.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move, we can't analyze any patterns yet. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. We could consider this human psychology factor.\n\nRisk Assessor: Given that all moves have equal risk-reward ratios (+1/-1), there's no inherently risky move. Paper could be a good counter if our opponent indeed chooses rock as suggested by the Pattern Analyzer.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with using paper. If opponent uses rock (a common first move), we win. If they use scissors, we lose. If they use paper, it's a tie. It's a reasonable first move with potential advantage against predicted behavior.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on our discussion, I'll proceed with paper as my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This could mean either they think similarly to us, or they have a specific strategy in mind. In game theory, after a tie, players often shift to try to gain advantage.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent matched our paper move. After a tie, players often try to \"beat\" their previous tied move. Since paper was played last round, they might expect us to play scissors to beat paper, and thus they might play rock to counter that prediction.\n\nRisk Assessor: While our Pattern Analyzer makes a good point about the opponent potentially playing rock, we should consider that sophisticated players might double-think this logic. However, the simplest and most common response after a paper-paper tie is indeed to play scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play paper again. Here's why:\n1. If opponent expects us to switch to scissors and plays rock, our paper wins\n2. If opponent maintains paper, we tie again\n3. If opponent plays scissors, we lose\n\nThe psychological element suggests opponents are less likely to play scissors immediately after using paper themselves.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. People tend to avoid repeating the same move three times in a row, so even if our opponent used paper twice, that's unlikely.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis makes sense. I'll go with paper again.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Our opponent shifted from paper to scissors, which was actually contrary to our prediction. They might be feeling frustrated after losing and might want to make a \"strong\" move now.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial moment. Our opponent has shown they're willing to switch moves, and they just lost with scissors. After a loss, players often:\n1. Switch to what would have beaten their previous move (rock beats their scissors)\n2. Or stick with their previous move hoping their opponent wouldn't expect that\n3. Or try to counter what just beat them (scissors to beat our paper)\n\nRisk Assessor: The opponent has demonstrated unpredictability by switching to scissors when we predicted rock. This suggests they might be using their own complex strategy rather than simple pattern-based decisions.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these factors, I recommend we play rock. Here's why:\n- It beats scissors if they repeat their last move\n- It's a logical counter to their previous scissors\n- If they try to beat our previous paper with scissors again, we win\n- Even if they predict this and play paper, we only lose one point, which we can afford after our recent win\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed.

Switching to scissors to beat an anticipated paper\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's consider our current position. We're ahead by 1 point overall, so we can afford to be slightly aggressive. However, we should be careful not to be too predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we've just had a tie with rock, and many players tend to switch after a tie, paper might be risky as it's a common choice after rock. Scissors would be an interesting choice here because:\n- It beats paper if they try to counter our previous rock\n- If they stick with rock (which is less likely after a tie), we only lose one point\n- It's the least expected move after a rock-rock tie\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. Most players wouldn't expect scissors after a rock-rock tie, giving us a potential psychological advantage.

While we could play conservatively to protect our lead, we need to capitalize on this apparent pattern we've detected.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their strong preference for paper, scissors becomes very tempting. However, they might expect this and finally switch away from paper. Let's consider each move:\n- Scissors: Beats paper but loses to rock\n- Rock: Loses to paper, which they seem to favor\n- Paper: Would tie against paper, their apparent preferred move\n\nPattern Analyzer: This might be the perfect time for scissors. Even if they're setting a trap, the consistent paper usage makes it worth the risk. They might be attempting to condition us to expect paper and then switch, but the frequency of their paper moves suggests it's a genuine preference.\n\nRisk Assessor: I agree. Sometimes the obvious move is the right move. The opponent might be overthinking and stick to paper, thinking we wouldn't expect them to use it again after such obvious repetition.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis is compelling.

Let's go with rock - it's a defensive yet strategic choice that could help us break their momentum while protecting our remaining lead.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They're showing masterful play and prediction.\n\nRisk Assessor: This is now a crucial moment. Our once-comfortable 6-point lead has been reduced to 2 points. We absolutely must stop their momentum.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has demonstrated:\n1. Perfect prediction of our last four moves\n2. Complete reversal of earlier game dynamics\n3. Strong psychological advantage right now\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their sequence:\nscissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\nThey've shown both tactical excellence and pattern awareness, while successfully countering our every move.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper for these reasons:\n1. They've just succeeded with scissors and might stick with it\n2. If they switch to rock (completing their recent pattern), we win\n3. If they play paper, we tie and stop the bleeding\n4. We need to break this cycle immediately\n\nRisk Assessor: Agreed. Paper is our best option here. A fifth consecutive loss would put us in serious jeopardy. We need to either win or force a tie to maintain control of the game.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Psychologically, after four straight wins:\n1. They might become overconfident and stick with scissors\n2. They might try to complete their pattern with rock\n3. They might overthink and try to predict our adjustment\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis is clear.

Use scissors anticipating our paper counter\n3. Stick with rock after its success\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors for these reasons:\n1. If they switch to paper (the most logical progression), we win\n2. If they play scissors, we tie and preserve our 1-point lead\n3.
