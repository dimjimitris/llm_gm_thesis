Let me analyze the game structure:\n   - Rock beats Scissors\n   - Scissors beats Paper\n   - Paper beats Rock\n   - Each win gives +1 point, each loss -1 point\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n3. Without any prior information, all moves are equally viable:\n   - Paper strategy: wins against rock, loses to scissors\n   - Rock strategy: wins against scissors, loses to paper\n   - Scissors strategy: wins against paper, loses to rock\n\n4. In this initial round, the opponent has no information about my strategy either, which makes their choice likely to be random or based on personal preference.\n\n5. Many players tend to choose Rock as their first move in Rock-Paper-Scissors games, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. This is a common psychological pattern.\n\n6. Given this psychological tendency, Paper would be a good counter-strategy for the first move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Breaking down recent ties:\n   - We're both moving through standard progressions\n   - Both trying to outsmart each other\n   - Both ending up at same conclusions\n   - Need to break this mirror-match pattern\n\n4. Game theory application:\n   - In high-tie situations, randomization can help\n   - But pure randomization ignores useful patterns\n   - Need controlled unpredictability\n\n5. Strategic innovation:\n   - After Paper, most expect Scissors\n   - After many ties, most try to break pattern\n   - Could use double-psychology:\n     * Opponent expects me to avoid obvious Scissors\n     * Might expect me to play Rock to counter their expected Scissors\n     * Might then play Paper to counter my expected Rock\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Going with the obvious choice might be unexpected\n   - Everyone trying to outsmart may loop back to basic\n   - Simple Scissors play might work precisely because it's obvious\n   - Sometimes the obvious play is the best play\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
