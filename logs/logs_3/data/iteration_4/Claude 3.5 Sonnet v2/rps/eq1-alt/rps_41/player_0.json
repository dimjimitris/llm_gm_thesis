    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the game structure:\n   - Rock beats Scissors\n   - Scissors beats Paper\n   - Paper beats Rock\n   - Each win gives +1 point, each loss -1 point\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n3. Without any prior information, all moves are equally viable:\n   - Paper strategy: wins against rock, loses to scissors\n   - Rock strategy: wins against scissors, loses to paper\n   - Scissors strategy: wins against paper, loses to rock\n\n4. In this initial round, the opponent has no information about my strategy either, which makes their choice likely to be random or based on personal preference.\n\n5. Many players tend to choose Rock as their first move in Rock-Paper-Scissors games, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. This is a common psychological pattern.\n\n6. Given this psychological tendency, Paper would be a good counter-strategy for the first move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Recent sequence:\n   - Last five rounds:\n     * Paper vs Paper (tie)\n     * Scissors vs Paper (loss)\n     * Rock vs Paper (win)\n     * Paper vs Rock (loss)\n   - Overall: 12 ties, 6 wins, 5 losses (score: +1)\n   - Score advantage continuing to shrink\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - No clear pattern in recent moves\n   - Opponent successfully breaking my predictions\n   - They're showing strong ability to:\n     a) Play unexpected moves\n     b) Counter my strategic thinking\n     c) Avoid predictable patterns\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - After winning with Rock:\n     * Might stay with winning move\n     * Might expect me to counter with Paper\n     * Might switch expecting my counter\n\n4. Strategic depth:\n   - If they stay with Rock: Paper wins\n   - If they expect Paper counter: Scissors wins\n   - If they play Scissors: Rock wins\n   - Simple counter-moves aren't working\n\n5. Meta-analysis:\n   - Opponent is consistently outthinking my strategy\n   - They seem to predict my logical progressions\n   - Need to break from predictable strategic thinking\n   - Sometimes the best move is the least analytical\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Going with Scissors because:\n     * It's not the obvious counter to their Rock\n     * Would beat Paper if they try to counter Rock\n     * Breaks from obvious Paper counter to Rock\n     * Sometimes simpler is better against sophisticated opponent\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
