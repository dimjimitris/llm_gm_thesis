    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For detecting patterns in opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk/reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In such cases, it's important to consider the game theory fundamentals. Each move has equal chance of winning or losing against one of the other moves.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move, we have no historical data to analyze. However, studies have shown that \"rock\" is often a common first move choice for many players, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that we're starting fresh with no information, we should avoid any high-risk strategies. Paper would be a good counter to the commonly chosen \"rock\" opening, while only being vulnerable to scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper has the psychological advantage of countering the common \"rock\" opening, and in the worst case, we only risk losing one point. Let's go with paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

They might anticipate us staying with paper and switch to scissors\n3. They might also be playing cautiously\n\nGame Strategist: When both players choose the same move, it often creates an interesting psychological dynamic. Players tend to either:\na) Stick with the same move hoping the opponent will change\nb) Change their move expecting the opponent to change\nc) Change their move expecting the opponent to stay the same\n\nRisk Manager: Given that our opponent seems to think similarly to us (choosing paper first), we should consider what a strategic player would do in their position. Many would expect us to switch to scissors or rock after a tie, making scissors a risky choice.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we choose rock. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with paper, we lose (-1)\n2. If they switch to scissors (expecting us to stay with paper), we win (+1)\n3. If they switch to rock, we tie (0)\nThis covers two favorable outcomes (win or tie) versus one negative outcome.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. Moreover, people tend to be less likely to stick with the same move after a tie, so the chance of them staying with paper is reduced.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

They're using very similar strategic thinking\n3. It could be pure coincidence, though less likely now\n\nGame Strategist: Two consecutive matches significantly reduces the probability of coincidence. If they are indeed following our moves, they might be:\n1. Waiting for us to establish a pattern before trying to counter it\n2. Playing defensively to minimize losses\n3. Using a mirroring strategy to force ties\n\nRisk Manager: The fact that they've matched us twice means they're either very good at predicting our moves or they're using a following strategy. If they're following us, they might expect us to complete the natural sequence (paper -> rock -> scissors).\n\nPattern Analyzer: However, if they're good at predicting, they might anticipate us breaking the natural sequence to avoid being predictable. This creates a interesting mind game.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we break the expected pattern and go with paper again. Here's why:\n1. It breaks the expected progression to scissors\n2. If they're following us, they might anticipate scissors and choose rock\n3. If they're trying to predict our pattern-break, they might choose rock thinking we'll choose paper again\n\nRisk Manager: I concur.

They weren't actually following our moves\n2. They might have anticipated our attempt to outsmart them\n3. They seem to favor rock (used it twice now)\n\nGame Strategist: This is a pivotal moment. Our opponent has shown they're capable of strategic thinking and possibly multi-level reasoning. The loss might also affect their psychology - they might:\n1. Stay with rock after a successful move\n2. Switch expecting us to counter their rock\n3. Try to stay one step ahead of our counter-strategy\n\nRisk Manager: We're at -1 points now, so we need to be more aggressive in seeking a win while still managing our risk. The opponent's demonstrated preference for rock gives us valuable information.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given their success with rock and human tendency to stick with winning moves, there's a significant chance they'll use rock again. Even if they expect us to counter with paper, they might use rock anyway thinking we'll overthink it.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper for these reasons:\n1. Direct counter to their apparent rock preference\n2. Even if they expect this counter and switch to scissors, this shows they're highly skilled and we can adjust our strategy accordingly\n3. If they try to double-bluff by switching to paper, we tie rather than lose\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. While it might seem obvious, paper is our best move here.

Make surprising switches (to scissors)\nThey're showing sophisticated play.\n\nRisk Manager: We're back at 0 points after the win. The opponent has now used all three moves, with a preference shown for rock (2 times), and their moves suggest they're thinking at least one step ahead.\n\nPattern Analyzer: After losing with scissors, they might:\n1. Return to their successful rock strategy\n2. Try to catch us off-guard with paper\n3. Stick with scissors expecting us to overthink\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated ability to think ahead and break patterns, I suggest scissors. Here's why:\n1.

If they stick with scissors, we tie\nThis gives us one win scenario, one loss scenario, and one tie scenario, but importantly, it counters what might be their most psychologically comfortable move (paper) after a loss.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with scissors. They've shown they're willing to switch moves after a loss, and paper would be a logical choice for them as it's the only move they've used just once so far.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The scissors play also protects us against them thinking we might go back to paper after our recent success with it.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've matched us three times now (paper, rock, scissors)\n3. But they've also shown ability to break patterns strategically\n\nGame Strategist: This latest tie with scissors adds another layer of complexity. When analyzing their style:\n1. They seem comfortable matching our moves (3 ties)\n2. They can make independent strategic choices (their winning rock move)\n3. They appear to think multiple steps ahead\n\nRisk Manager: We're still at 0 points total. The opponent has shown they're highly skilled at this game, making it crucial to choose carefully. After a tie with scissors, traditional rock-paper-scissors psychology often leads players to choose rock (as it's seen as a \"strong\" move after scissors).\n\nPattern Analyzer: However, given our opponent's sophisticated play, they might:\n1. Anticipate us choosing rock and counter with paper\n2. Try to double-bluff by staying with scissors\n3. Choose rock themselves, expecting us to overthink\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper for these reasons:\n1. It beats the psychologically natural rock move after scissors\n2.

Their repeated scissors use might indicate they're trying to establish a pattern\n\nGame Strategist: This is a critical moment. We just won with paper, and they've lost with scissors twice now. Psychology suggests:\n1. They might abandon scissors after multiple unsuccessful attempts\n2. They could be frustrated and switch to an aggressive rock play\n3. They might expect us to choose rock to counter their scissors trend\n\nRisk Manager: We're at +1 points now, which gives us some strategic flexibility. We need to balance between protecting our lead and seeking another win.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The three consecutive scissors moves from them is either:\n1. A genuine pattern they've fallen into\n2. A deliberate setup to make us choose rock\n3. A complex mind game where they expect us to see through the pattern\n\nGame Strategist: Given this situation, I recommend rock. Here's why:\n1. It directly counters their most recent pattern of scissors\n2. If they switch to paper (expecting our rock), we lose but only return to 0\n3. If they choose rock, we tie and maintain our lead\n4. The risk of them choosing scissors again (which would be their fourth time) seems lower after two losses with it\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with rock.

Switch to scissors expecting us to repeat rock\n2. Try rock as a \"reset\" move\n3. Stick with paper hoping we overthink\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors for these reasons:\n1.

Psychologically, after losing with paper, they might be reluctant to immediately switch to rock\n\nRisk Manager: Scissors does provide a balanced approach here.

Few would choose scissors directly after rock\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend staying with rock for these reasons:\n1.

They've shown they can make unexpected plays when needed\n\nGame Strategist: This was a significant turn:\n1. They successfully broke our prediction by using scissors after rock\n2. They've demonstrated ability to play against conventional wisdom\n3. They might be gaining momentum with this win\n\nRisk Manager: With our lead cut to +1, we need to be more careful. The opponent has shown they're willing to make bold moves and can think multiple levels ahead.\n\nPattern Analyzer: After their successful scissors play, they might:\n1. Feel confident and stick with scissors\n2. Expect us to choose paper to counter their potential rock\n3. Switch to rock anticipating our scissors counter\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper for these reasons:\n1. If they stick with scissors after success (a common psychological tendency), we lose but still end up even\n2. If they switch to rock (expecting our scissors counter), we win and extend our lead\n3. If they try paper themselves, we tie and maintain our +1\n4. The opponent has shown they're willing to make bold moves, making rock a likely choice for them\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with paper. While it's vulnerable to their scissors repeat, rock seems too obvious a counter and might be what they're expecting. Paper gives us a good chance to catch them if they switch to rock, which seems likely given their demonstrated ability to avoid predictable patterns.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The paper play also accounts for the fact that they might expect us to choose scissors to counter their previous scissors move, in which case they might choose rock defensively.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

The high number of ties suggests both players are reading each other well\n3.

Move to rock expecting us to predict scissors\n3. Stay with paper anticipating we'll overthink\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors for these reasons:\n1. After so many ties, there's psychological pressure to break the pattern\n2. If they stay with paper (expecting us to overthink), we win\n3. If they switch to rock (trying to be clever), we lose but end up even\n4. If they also choose scissors, we maintain our lead with a tie\n5. Most importantly, they need to win, which might make them less likely to choose rock (which would be a defensive move)\n\nRisk Manager: Scissors is a strong choice. Their need to win might make them reluctant to use rock (which at best would give them a tie). They're more likely to either stick with paper hoping we switch, or match our scissors expecting us to use scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The scissors play also follows natural game flow after paper, while accounting for the fact that both players have shown they can think several levels deep in their strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

If they stay with scissors (out of desperation), we win and end any doubt\n2. If they switch to paper, we lose but maintain +2 lead\n3. If they also choose rock, we maintain lead with tie\n4. Being three points behind may make them avoid paper as too defensive\n\nRisk Manager: Rock is the safest play here. Even if we lose to paper, we maintain a dominant position. Their desperate situation might make them stick with scissors hoping for a quick win.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The rock play also follows natural game flow after scissors while protecting against desperate aggressive plays.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"
