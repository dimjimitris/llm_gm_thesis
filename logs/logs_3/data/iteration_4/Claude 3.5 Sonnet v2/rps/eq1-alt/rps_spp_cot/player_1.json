    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without any prior knowledge, all moves are equally viable:\n   - Rock is strong against scissors but weak against paper\n   - Paper is strong against rock but weak against scissors\n   - Scissors is strong against paper but weak against rock\n\n4. For an initial move, I'll choose rock for these reasons:\n   - Rock is a psychologically \"strong\" opening move\n   - Many players choose scissors as first move thinking it's \"aggressive\"\n   - Even if I lose, I'll learn about the opponent's initial strategy\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] rock\n"

Psychological analysis:\n   - After a tie with scissors, many players will switch\n   - Rock would be a natural choice to beat the previous scissors play\n   - They might anticipate I'll stick with scissors after the tie\n\n4. Strategy formation:\n   - If they switch to rock as predicted, paper would win\n   - If they stick with scissors, rock would win\n   - Rock seems safer since it beats scissors (their last move)\n   - Paper is riskier but could pay off if they're thinking ahead\n\n5.

Psychological analysis:\n   - After two identical ties:\n     * There's extreme pressure to break the pattern\n     * Both players know this pressure exists\n     * Both players know the other knows\n   - This creates a complex mind game\n\n4. Strategic layers:\n   - Layer 1: Most obvious move is paper to beat rock\n   - Layer 2: They might expect paper and play scissors\n   - Layer 3: They might expect me to think Layer 2 and stick with rock\n   - Layer 4: They might expect me to overthink and try to outsmart them\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock again seems too passive\n   - Playing scissors is risky if they choose paper\n   - Playing paper is risky if they expect it\n   - But paper breaks the stalemate most directly\n\n6. Decision making:\n   - The rock stalemate must end\n   - The psychological pressure to switch is too high\n   - Even if they anticipate paper, staying with rock isn't viable\n   - Need to take calculated risk\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] paper\n"

Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Round 20: I rock, they paper (win)\n   - Round 21: I rock, they scissors (loss)\n   - Round 22: I scissors, they paper (loss)\n   - Round 23: I rock, they scissors (loss)\n\n2. Critical situation:\n   - My score is now -6\n   - Lost last three rounds consecutively\n   - Their sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They're showing a clear pattern alternating paper/scissors\n\n3. Pattern insight:\n   - They've avoided rock for several rounds\n   - They're alternating between paper and scissors\n   - This pattern seems too obvious to be coincidental\n   - They might be setting up another trap\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - They're completely dominating the game\n   - They might be confident enough to be obvious\n   - Or they might be baiting me to follow the pattern\n   - They've consistently shown sophisticated strategy\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If pattern holds, they should play paper next\n   - But they rarely maintain predictable patterns\n   - They might expect me to predict paper\n   - They often counter obvious counters\n\n6. Decision making:\n   - Following their pattern suggests paper is next\n   - But they've consistently outthought my predictions\n   - They might expect me to play scissors to beat expected paper\n   - Paper would be unexpected and beat rock if they try to counter expected scissors\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] paper\n"
