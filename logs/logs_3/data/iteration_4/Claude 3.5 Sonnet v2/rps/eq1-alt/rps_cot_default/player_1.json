    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The game score remains at 0, with each of us having moments of successfully breaking patterns.\n\n[move] scissors\n\nMy reasoning:\n1. After two consecutive appearances of paper (in the tie), there might be a tendency to stick with paper\n2. If they do stay with paper, my scissors wins\n3. If they think I'll use scissors to beat expected paper, they might switch to rock\n4. However, given our history of matching moves, they might also choose scissors, leading to another tie\n5. The high frequency of ties suggests we're often thinking alike, so they might follow the same logic train\n6. With a tied score, this move presents a good balance of risk and reward\n\nThis move attempts to capitalize on potential paper persistence while acknowledging that my opponent has shown both the tendency to match moves and the ability to break patterns strategically.\n"
