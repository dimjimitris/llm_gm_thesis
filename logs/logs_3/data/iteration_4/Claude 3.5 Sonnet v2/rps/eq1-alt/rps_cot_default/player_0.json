    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without any prior information, the moves are theoretically equally viable:\n   - Each move can win against one option and lose against another\n   - Each move has a 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or drawing\n\n4. Classic game theory suggests that in this situation, random selection is a good starting strategy to avoid being predictable.\n\n5. Among the three options, I'll choose rock for this first move because:\n   - It's a psychologically strong opening move\n   - Many players tend to choose scissors in their first move thinking others will choose paper\n   - Even if I'm wrong, this will give me information about the opponent's strategy\n\n[move] rock\n"

Strategic options:\n   - Stay with rock: Predictable, likely to be countered\n   - Switch to paper: Expected move, might be anticipated\n   - Switch to scissors: Could catch opponent switching to paper\n\n4. Decision reasoning:\n   - Since the opponent showed similar thinking by also choosing rock first\n   - They might anticipate me switching to paper\n   - Therefore, switching to scissors might be too risky\n\n5. I'll choose paper because:\n   - If opponent stays with rock (due to success bias), I win\n   - If opponent tries to be clever and predicts scissors, they would have skipped the most logical next move\n   - This is the most straightforward strategic progression\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyzing the successful break:\n   - The opponent finally broke the mirroring pattern\n   - They likely expected me to switch after two rocks\n   - They chose paper, the logical counter to rock\n   - But my unconventional repeat worked in my favor\n\n3. Psychological dynamics:\n   - The opponent just lost to an unexpected move\n   - They might be frustrated by losing to a seemingly \"naive\" strategy\n   - They might expect me to get overconfident and try the same again\n\n4. Opponent's likely responses:\n   - They might expect another rock (third time's a charm thinking)\n   - They might expect me to switch completely after success\n   - They're likely to avoid paper after just losing with it\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Repeating rock would be too extreme\n   - They'll likely expect me to switch to something conventional\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll do\n\nI'll choose scissors because:\n   - It's not the obvious next move after winning with rock\n   - If they expect me to choose paper (to counter their expected rock), they'll choose scissors, leading to a tie\n   - If they try to counter my previous rock with paper again, I win\n   - If they choose rock expecting me to be tricky, I lose but it's a calculated risk\n   - This maintains the element of unpredictability that just worked for me\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Pattern recognition:\n   - After my unconventional win, we immediately fell back to mirroring\n   - The opponent continues to think similarly\n   - Breaking patterns has been temporary and we reset to synchronization\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   - Both players are likely aware of the strong mirroring tendency\n   - After scissors, most would expect rock as next move\n   - The opponent might expect me to try another unconventional move\n\n4. Success analysis:\n   - My most recent win came from being stubbornly unconventional (repeat rock)\n   - Complex strategies haven't outperformed simple ones\n   - Breaking mirror patterns has been difficult but rewarding\n\n5. Strategic conclusion:\n   - Need to break the mirroring cycle again\n   - Conventional responses haven't led to wins\n   - The opponent likely expects either rock (conventional) or paper (tricky)\n\nI'll choose scissors again because:\n   - Like my successful double-rock strategy, staying with scissors is highly unconventional\n   - Nobody expects the same move after a tie\n   - If they go conventional with rock, I lose but break the mirror\n   - If they try to be clever with paper, I win\n   - This continues my previous successful strategy of stubbornly repeating moves\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Recent sequence:\n   - Round 20: Scissors vs Paper (loss)\n   - Round 21: Rock vs Rock (tie)\n   - Round 22: Rock vs Paper (win)\n   - Round 23: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n   - Back to mirroring but maintaining stability\n\n2. Pattern evaluation:\n   - Simple strategies continue to be effective\n   - The opponent continues to mirror in basic situations\n   - We've moved from losses to more stable results\n   - The game has settled into a more fundamental rhythm\n\n3. Current situation:\n   - Just had a scissors mirror match\n   - Conventional next move would be rock\n   - The opponent has shown strong mirroring tendencies\n   - But they can also make unexpected moves\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Following the conventional rock move might be too obvious\n   - Another scissors would be extremely bold\n   - Need to maintain the balance between basic and unexpected\n   - Want to avoid returning to complex mind games\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Rock is the expected counter to scissors\n   - The opponent might expect me to avoid the obvious\n   - They've shown they can match basic plays\n   - Simple but unexpected has been working\n\nI'll choose paper because:\n   - It's neither the conventional move (rock) after scissors\n   - Nor is it a bold repeat (scissors)\n   - If they go conventional with rock, I win\n   - If they try to be clever with scissors, I lose but maintain unpredictability\n   - This maintains my recent strategy of simple but non-obvious plays\n   - It's unexpected while still being fundamentally sound\n\n[move] paper\n"
