    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For studying opponent behavior and adapting strategies\n3. Decision Expert - For making final move recommendations based on available information\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when facing uncertainty, it's often beneficial to start with a balanced approach. All three moves have equal winning and losing possibilities against other moves.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move and we have no historical data, we can't predict the opponent's behavior. We should focus on establishing our own initial position that doesn't give away any strategic patterns yet.\n\nDecision Expert: I agree with both perspectives. For the first move, we should avoid being too predictable. Rock is often a common first move choice by many players because it feels \"strong,\" so people tend to counter that with paper. We could take advantage of this psychological tendency.\n\nGame Strategist: That's a good point. If we expect the opponent might think we'll play rock, and then they play paper to counter it, we could play scissors to win against their paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: However, we should be careful not to over-strategize with limited information. Any move is theoretically equal in terms of probability at this point.\n\nDecision Expert: Let's go with scissors for our first move. It takes advantage of the possible paper counter to the common rock opening, while still maintaining an equal chance against other moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Starting with scissors to counter potential paper plays while maintaining balanced odds\n"

Let's analyze what this means:\n1. The opponent chose rock first - this could be the \"strong opening\" tendency we discussed\n2. They might switch strategies now after losing\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent might reason that since we played scissors and lost to their rock, we might switch to rock ourselves. Following this logic, they might play paper to beat our expected rock. However, they might also stick to rock since it would have won in the previous round if the scoring was reversed.\n\nDecision Expert: This is a classic psychological moment in the game. Our opponent has two likely responses:\n1. Switch to paper expecting us to play rock (trying to adapt)\n2. Stick with rock (thinking it should have worked)\n\nPattern Analyst: We could:\n- Play paper to beat their potential rock if they stick to it\n- Play scissors again if they switch to paper\n- Play rock if they try to get clever and play scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Given that players often try to adapt after losing, I think they're more likely to switch their move than stick with rock.\n\nDecision Expert: I agree. Let's play scissors again. Here's why:\n1. If they switch to paper (highly likely), we win\n2. If they stick to rock (less likely), we already know we can recover from that loss\n3. If they play scissors, it's a tie and we maintain our lead\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Maintaining scissors as we expect opponent to switch to paper after their rock lost\n"

Round 2: Opponent played scissors, we played scissors (tie)\nThis shows they've shifted from rock to scissors, indicating they're actively adapting their strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: The tie in the second round creates an interesting psychological situation. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, after a tie, players often:\n1. Try to outsmart their opponent by predicting their next move\n2. Sometimes stick with the same move, thinking the opponent will change\n3. Move one step \"forward\" in the cycle (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock)\n\nDecision Expert: Given that the opponent has shown they're willing to change moves (rock \u2192 scissors), they're likely an adaptive player. After a tie with scissors, they might:\n1. Play rock to beat our potential scissors if they think we'll repeat\n2. Play paper if they think we'll switch to rock\n3. Keep scissors if they think we're overthinking\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their progression (rock \u2192 scissors), and considering they're adaptive, they might try to complete the cycle by moving to paper.\n\nGame Strategist: I think they'll expect us to switch from scissors since we've used it twice now. They might play rock to counter our potential third scissors play.\n\nDecision Expert: Given these analyses, I recommend we play rock. Here's why:\n1. If they play paper (completing their cycle), we lose but minimize our overall risk\n2. If they play rock (trying to beat scissors), we tie\n3. If they play scissors (sticking to last move), we win\n\nThis balances our risk while giving us a good chance at winning if they maintain their adaptive behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Switching to rock as opponent shows adaptive behavior and might try to counter our scissors pattern\n"

Round 3: Opponent(paper) vs Us(rock) - We won\nThe opponent has played rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, showing a clockwise progression through the moves.\n\nGame Strategist: This is crucial information! The opponent appears to be following a systematic rotation through the moves, regardless of the outcome. If they continue this pattern, their next move should be rock.\n\nDecision Expert: Hold on, we should consider two possibilities:\n1. They might continue their rotation pattern (suggesting rock next)\n2. They might break the pattern since they've lost twice and tied once - they haven't won any rounds yet\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking deeper at their behavior:\n- They haven't repeated any move yet\n- They've followed a perfect clockwise rotation\n- They've lost twice despite using this structured approach\nThis might frustrate them enough to abandon the pattern\n\nGame Strategist: If they continue the rotation: they'll play rock\nIf they break the pattern, they might:\n- Try to predict our move and counter it\n- Use their most successful move so far (none have won)\n- Use a completely random choice out of frustration\n\nDecision Expert: Given these analyses, I recommend we play paper.

They've broken their rotation pattern and returned to rock.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a significant change! After losing multiple times with their rotation strategy, they reverted to rock - possibly because:\n1. Rock was their opening move\n2. Rock is often seen as a \"strong\" fallback option\n3. They're trying to establish a new pattern\n\nDecision Expert: The opponent has demonstrated they can:\n1. Follow a pattern (first three moves)\n2. Break a pattern when it's not working\n3.

Our wins have come from:\n- Unexpected scissors vs rock win\n- Traditional rock vs paper win\n- Now paper vs scissors win\nThe winning conditions seem to be alternating between traditional and reversed rules.\n\nDecision Expert: This pattern suggests:\n1. The rules might be alternating each round\n2. Wins might be determined by a different hidden pattern\n3. The opponent might be following a strategy we haven't fully decoded\n\nPattern Analyst: If we compare our last three moves:\nRound 7: scissors won against rock\nRound 8: scissors lost to paper\nRound 9: paper won against scissors\n\nGame Strategist: The alternating pattern of wins suggests that whatever move would normally lose in the next round might actually win. Following this logic:\n1. Last round paper won against scissors (reverse of normal)\n2. This round might return to normal rules\n3. Or continue the pattern of reverse wins\n\nDecision Expert: I recommend we play rock. Here's why:\n1. If the rules are normal this round, rock beats scissors\n2. If the rules are reversed, rock might beat paper\n3. This continues our pattern of making unexpected moves\n4. We maintain unpredictability while testing the rule pattern\n5.

Opponent has shown they can mirror our moves for ties\n3. We've had 5 ties total, showing both players are good at predicting\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at win conditions:\n- Our wins came from unexpected combinations\n- Ties have often come when both players are trying to be defensive\n- Losses occurred when opponent successfully predicted our moves\n\nDecision Expert: After a rock-rock tie, traditional psychology suggests:\n1. Players often stick with rock, viewing it as a \"strong\" move\n2. Some switch to paper expecting the rock repeat\n3. Few choose scissors as it's risky against potential rock\n\nGame Strategist: Given our opponent's demonstrated ability to match our moves and adapt, they might:\n1. Expect us to switch to paper to beat their potential rock\n2. Play scissors to counter our expected paper\n3. Stay with rock hoping for another tie\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent has shown they're skilled at both pattern recognition and pattern breaking. We need a move that maintains our unpredictability.\n\nDecision Expert: I recommend we play rock again. Here's why:\n1. Most players expect a change after a tie\n2. Playing the same move is psychologically unexpected\n3. If they switch to paper (the most common post-rock-tie move), we lose but it's calculated\n4.

They're either very confident or very cautious\n3. This creates a strong psychological pressure to break the pattern\n\nPattern Analyst: After double rock-rock ties:\n1. The tension to switch moves is extremely high\n2. Both players know this tension exists\n3. This creates a complex mind game about who will break first\n\nDecision Expert: The standard psychology after multiple same-move ties suggests:\n1. Most players feel compelled to switch\n2. The first player to switch often loses if the other anticipates it\n3. Triple repetition is extremely rare in RPS\n\nGame Strategist: Our opponent has demonstrated they:\n1. Can match our moves consistently\n2. Are willing to play conservatively with ties\n3. Understand complex pattern psychology\n\nDecision Expert: In this highly charged situation, I recommend we play rock again. Here's why:\n1. Triple repetition is so rare that it becomes a powerful move\n2. The psychological pressure to switch is so strong that staying becomes unexpected\n3. If opponent switches to paper (most likely response), we lose but it's a calculated risk\n4. If opponent switches to scissors (trying to beat our expected paper), we win\n5.

The rules might have flipped again (similar to our earlier scissors vs rock win)\n2. There might be a pattern to when rule reversals occur\n3.

Will eventually break stalemates (as they just did)\n2. Might be confused about the winning conditions\n3. Could be trying to figure out the pattern themselves\n\nGame Strategist: Given this situation, they might:\n1. Return to rock, thinking the rules have normalized\n2. Continue with paper since it should have won\n3. Switch to scissors to try a completely different approach\n\nDecision Expert: I recommend we play scissors. Here's why:\n1. If the reversed rules continue, scissors would beat rock (which they might play)\n2. If rules are normal, scissors beats paper (which they might stick with)\n3.

Finally realize the rules are reversed and adapt\n2. Get confused and stick to traditional strategy\n3. Play more cautiously while trying to confirm the pattern\n\nDecision Expert: I recommend we play scissors again. Here's why:\n1. Under reversed rules, scissors beats rock\n2.

The pressure to break the tie cycle is extreme\n2. Both players have shown they can read each other well\n3.

We finally broke the tie streak\n2. We won with rock against paper - indicating reversed rules\n3. The opponent broke their mirroring strategy\n4. We're back to the reversed rule pattern we saw earlier\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at the win pattern:\n- Earlier wins came in reversed rules\n- This win was also under reversed rules\n- After a reversed rules round, we often see a normal rules round\n\nDecision Expert: Based on alternating rules theory:\n1. Last round was reversed (rock beat paper)\n2. This round should be normal rules\n3. We need to play according to traditional RPS rules\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown they:\n1. Finally broke their mirroring strategy\n2. Might still be confused about rule reversals\n3. Could return to defensive mirroring after losing\n\nDecision Expert: I recommend we play paper. Here's why:\n1. If we're correct about normal rules this round:\n   - Paper beats rock (good if they try to counter our last winning rock)\n   - Paper loses to scissors (calculated risk)\n2. The opponent might:\n   - Play rock to beat our potential scissors\n   - Try scissors to beat our potential paper\n   - Return to mirroring strategy with paper\n3. Most importantly:\n   - It follows our understanding of alternating rules\n   - It's a strong play against their most likely response (rock)\n   - It maintains our strategic advantage from breaking the tie cycle\n   - It works well whether they're playing strategically or defensively\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Playing paper expecting normal rules this round, strong against likely rock response after their loss\n"

Our alternating rules theory was wrong:\n1. Round 19: Rock beat paper (reversed rules)\n2. Round 20: Rock beat paper (reversed rules again)\nThis suggests the rules are CONSISTENTLY REVERSED, not alternating!\n\nPattern Analyst: Under consistently reversed rules:\n- Scissors beats Rock\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Paper beats Scissors\n\nDecision Expert: This is a breakthrough understanding! Now we know:\n1. Rules are consistently reversed from traditional RPS\n2. Our previous alternating theory led to our loss\n3. The opponent might also have figured this out\n\nGame Strategist: Given the opponent just won with rock under reversed rules, they might:\n1. Stay with rock since it worked\n2. Switch to scissors expecting our rock\n3. Switch to paper trying to be unpredictable\n\nDecision Expert: I recommend we play scissors. Here's why:\n1. Under reversed rules:\n   - Scissors beats rock (which they might repeat after success)\n   - Scissors loses to paper (calculated risk)\n2. The opponent's perspective:\n   - They might stick with winning rock\n   - They might expect us to play rock to beat their potential paper\n   - They might try paper to beat our potential scissors\n3. Most importantly:\n   - It directly counters their successful rock if they repeat\n   - It follows our new understanding of consistently reversed rules\n   - It's an aggressive move that shows confidence after our loss\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Playing scissors under consistently reversed rules, expecting opponent might stick with their winning rock move\n"
