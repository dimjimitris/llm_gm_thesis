    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since I have no information about the opponent's tendencies:\n   - Each move has equal potential for winning/losing\n   - Each move wins against one option and loses against another\n   - The game is perfectly balanced\n\n4. Common psychology in RPS:\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for many players\n   - It's seen as a \"strong\" opening move\n   - Many players might expect others to play rock first and counter with paper\n\n5. Given this reasoning, I'll choose scissors:\n   - If opponent plays expected paper to counter anticipated rock, I win\n   - If opponent plays rock, I learn they might be straightforward player\n   - This gives me information for future rounds\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Behavior after renewed failure:\n   - Players in this state often:\n     * Completely abandon pattern-based play\n     * Make emotional rather than logical choices\n     * Revert to their earliest strategies\n     * Or try random moves out of desperation\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - After losing with scissors, they might:\n     * Return to rock (their original comfort move)\n     * Try paper (their last semi-successful move)\n     * Stick with scissors (very unlikely after loss)\n   - Given their history of reverting to rock under pressure, and their current state of frustration, rock seems most likely\n\n5. Final reasoning:\n   - I'll play paper\n   - This counters their likely reversion to rock\n   - In moments of peak frustration, they've consistently returned to rock\n   - Even if they try something else, this move will help confirm if they've completely abandoned patterns\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Analyzing recent sequence:\n   - Round 20: They paper, I scissors (I won)\n   - Round 21: They rock, I rock (tie)\n   - Round 22: They paper, I paper (tie)\n   - Round 23: They scissors, I scissors (tie)\n   - Four consecutive ties with one win between them\n\n2. Pattern observation:\n   - We've hit a series of mirrored moves\n   - Recent ties with all three moves (rock, paper, scissors)\n   - They finally broke their paper-tie \u2192 scissors pattern\n   - Both players seem to be reading each other well\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   - String of ties suggests:\n     * Both players are anticipating each other\n     * They might feel they're \"reading\" the game better\n     * Neither player is taking big risks\n     * There's a stalemate situation\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - After scissors tie, they might:\n     * Play rock (natural progression)\n     * Stick with scissors (worked for tie)\n     * Try paper (breaking pattern)\n   - The natural progression suggests rock\n   - But they might expect me to expect rock\n\n5. Final reasoning:\n   - I'll play rock\n   - Because:\n     * After so many ties, someone needs to break pattern\n     * They're more likely to stick with scissors because:\n       - It just \"worked\" (got a tie)\n       - Breaking patterns has been risky for them\n       - They've shown preference for move repetition\n     * Even if they play paper, this gives valuable information\n     * We need to break the tie streak\n     * Their historical behavior suggests they're more likely to repeat a \"safe\" move than make sophisticated counter-plays\n\n[move] rock\n"
