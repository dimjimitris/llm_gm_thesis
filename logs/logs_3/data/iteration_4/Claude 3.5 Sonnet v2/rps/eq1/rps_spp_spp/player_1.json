    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - Focuses on analyzing patterns and behavioral tendencies\n3. Risk Manager - Evaluates risks and rewards of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since we're playing against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. In Rock Paper Scissors, no single move dominates others - each move wins against one option and loses against another. Without prior information, we should consider a balanced approach.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Also, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move in RPS games, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. This is a documented psychological tendency.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that we don't have any prior information, we should consider both offensive and defensive strategies. Paper would be a good counter to the common \"Rock\" opening, while having equal chances against other moves.\n\nGame Strategist: I concur with using Paper. It counters the common Rock opening, and even if we're wrong, we only risk losing one point. The potential reward-to-risk ratio is favorable.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Paper also has the psychological advantage of feeling less aggressive than Rock or Scissors, which might make it less obvious as an opening move to our opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper This is a strategic opening move that counters the common \"Rock\" first move while maintaining balanced odds against other possibilities.\n"

They're also using strategic thinking\n2. They might anticipate us sticking with Paper\n3. They could be following a pattern-based strategy\n\nGame Strategist: When players tie with Paper, there's often a tendency to switch to Scissors in the next round, thinking their opponent will stick with Paper. However, this is also a well-known pattern that sophisticated players might try to exploit.\n\nRisk Manager: We need to consider that our opponent might be:\n- Switching to Scissors (most likely)\n- Switching to Rock (to counter our potential Scissors)\n- Sticking with Paper (least likely after a tie)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given that both players showed strategic thinking by choosing Paper first, this suggests we're dealing with a thoughtful opponent who might anticipate obvious next moves.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play Rock. Here's why:\n1. It beats the Scissors that many would play after a Paper tie\n2. If they try to be extra clever and stick with Paper, we only lose one point\n3. If they try to counter the common Scissors play by playing Rock, we tie\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with Rock. It protects against the most likely move (Scissors) while having acceptable outcomes in other scenarios.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock This move counters the likely Scissors play while maintaining reasonable outcomes against other possibilities.\n"

Our opponent has matched our moves twice now:\n- Round 1: Paper vs Paper\n- Round 2: Rock vs Rock\nThey might be:\n1. Following our moves somehow\n2. Using similar strategic thinking\n3. Playing a mirroring strategy\n\nGame Strategist: If they are indeed mirroring our moves, we could use this to our advantage. However, we should also consider that they might break this pattern at any time for strategic advantage.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze possible scenarios:\n1. If they're mirroring, they'll play whatever we play\n2. If they're trying to break the pattern, they might anticipate us using Paper (to break the Rock stalemate)\n3. They might expect us to use Scissors (following the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors sequence)\n\nPattern Analyzer: The two ties suggest our opponent is either very good at predicting our moves or is actually following our moves. Breaking this pattern might be crucial.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest Scissors for these reasons:\n1. It breaks the natural progression that many would expect (Paper after Rock)\n2. If they're mirroring, we'll tie again but gather more information\n3. If they try to counter the expected Paper play by using Scissors, we'll tie\n4. If they do play Paper thinking we'll follow the natural progression, we win\n\nRisk Manager: Scissors offers a good risk-reward ratio in this situation. Even if they predict this move, the worst case is losing one point, while we have a good chance of winning if they follow the natural progression to Paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors This move breaks the expected pattern while maintaining a good risk-reward ratio.\n"

Following a simpler pattern than we thought\n2. Prone to playing Paper as a \"safe\" move\n3. Slower to adapt to pattern breaks\n\nGame Strategist: The fact that they played Paper when we broke the pattern is significant. It could mean:\n1. They're trying to revert to their comfort move\n2. They expected us to follow the natural Rock\u2192Paper progression\n3. They might be tilted after losing and could try to counter Scissors now\n\nRisk Manager: After a loss, players often:\n1. Try to counter their losing move (suggesting Rock to beat our Scissors)\n2. Stick to their strategy hoping we'll change (staying with Paper)\n3. Mirror the winning move (switching to Scissors)\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend staying with Scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they're slow to adapt, they might play Paper again\n2. If they switch to Rock, we only lose one point\n3. Most importantly, they've shown a Paper preference, and changing after a loss is psychologically difficult\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Their Paper plays in rounds 1 and 3 suggest a possible bias towards this move, and players often need more than one negative result to break their patterns.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors Given their shown preference for Paper and the psychological difficulty of changing strategy after a loss, we'll maintain Scissors for this round.\n"

The opponent has:\n- Successfully countered us twice in a row\n- Shown they can think one step ahead of our logic\n- Demonstrated increasing aggression in their plays\n\nGame Strategist: Their pattern suggests they're actively predicting our moves based on game theory principles. They anticipated:\n1. That we'd switch to Paper after losing to Rock\n2. That we'd try to counter their winning move\nThis suggests a sophisticated opponent.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at their progression (Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors), they're getting more aggressive and proactive rather than reactive. They might expect us to play Rock now to counter their Scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: Given we've lost twice, they might expect us to play more defensively. However, being predictable has cost us the last two rounds.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play Scissors again, here's why:\n1. They might expect us to play Rock to counter their Scissors\n2.

Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\nSecond Scissors tie!\n\nRisk Manager: Situation remains critical:\n- Still at -2 points\n- Second consecutive tie\n- Previous Scissors tie led to Rock-Rock tie\n- Need to make up ground with limited rounds left\n\nGame Strategist: Key observations:\n1. After their last Scissors tie they played Rock\n2. They've consistently matched our defensive moves\n3. They've punished our predictable patterns\n4. We need a breakthrough move\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent has shown:\n1. Excellent ability to mirror our moves\n2. Strong pattern recognition\n3. Tendency to play Rock after Scissors\n4. But also ability to break their own patterns\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Paper. Here's why:\n1. If they follow their pattern of Rock after Scissors, we win\n2. If they try to predict our Rock counter and play Paper, we tie\n3. Only loses to Scissors, which is psychologically difficult to play twice\n4. We need to take calculated risks to overcome the deficit\n5. This breaks the common Rock-after-Scissors pattern\n\nRisk Manager: While risky, Paper offers our best chance to gain a point. With our deficit, we need to make moves that have winning potential. Their historical tendency toward Rock after Scissors makes this our best opportunity.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological difficulty of playing Scissors twice in a row, combined with their shown tendency for Rock after Scissors ties, makes Paper our strongest play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper This move anticipates their likely Rock play while offering a strong chance to gain a needed point in our deficit situation.\n"

Historically countered strongly after losses\n2. Often used Scissors to punish repeated Paper plays\n3. Might be frustrated after losing with Rock\n4. Has shown ability to adapt quickly\n\nPattern Analyzer: After losing with Rock, they typically:\n1. Switch to Paper (to counter expected Rock)\n2. Use Scissors (to punish repeated Paper)\n3. Rarely stick with Rock after losing with it\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Rock. Here's why:\n1. Protects against their likely Scissors counter\n2. They've previously punished repeated Paper plays\n3. Even if they play Paper, we're no worse off points-wise\n4. We need to protect our momentum\n5. Shows we can adapt and aren't predictable\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. Rock offers the best protection against their likely Scissors counter while maintaining a reasonable position against Paper. With only one point needed to tie, we can't risk losing to an obvious Scissors counter.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their adaptive style and our recent Paper success makes Scissors their most likely response. Rock provides our best chance to continue our comeback.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock This defensive move protects against their likely Scissors counter while maintaining our chance to tie the game.\n"

They've shown mastery with Paper against our Rock\n2. They've maintained composure throughout\n3. They've consistently outthought our strategies\n4. We need a breakthrough move\n\nPattern Analyzer: After winning with Paper, they historically:\n1. Sometimes stick with Paper (showing confidence)\n2. Sometimes switch to Rock (anticipating Scissors)\n3. Have shown they can predict our adaptations\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Scissors. Here's why:\n1. Direct counter to their successful Paper play\n2. We absolutely need points now\n3. Playing conservatively isn't an option anymore\n4. They might be confident enough to stick with Paper\n5. Even if we lose, we need to take this risk\n\nRisk Manager: With our deficit and limited chances remaining, we need to take calculated risks. Scissors offers our best chance for a comeback, even though it's risky. Playing defensively hasn't worked.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their consistent success might make them overconfident with Paper. We need to exploit this possibility with Scissors, as it's our best chance to gain points back.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors With our significant deficit and limited opportunities remaining, we need to make an aggressive play to counter their successful Paper strategy.\n"

After previous Scissors ties:\n   - Round 17\u219218: They played Rock\n   - Round 20\u219221: They played Rock\n2. But they've shown ability to break patterns\n3. Time pressure might affect both players' decisions\n\nPattern Analyzer: Key patterns:\n1. After Scissors ties, Rock has been common\n2. They've consistently predicted our adaptations\n3. They might expect us to know their Rock tendency\n4. End-game pressure changes normal patterns\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Paper. Here's why:\n1. They've played Rock after Scissors ties before\n2. The end-game pressure might make them play conservatively\n3. If they try to predict our Rock counter and play Paper, we tie\n4. We must take calculated risks to overcome the deficit\n5. Playing defensively with Rock isn't an option anymore\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. With our significant deficit and limited rounds, we need winning moves, not safe plays. Paper gives us our best chance to score if they follow their historical pattern of Rock after Scissors ties.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The endgame situation might push them toward conservative play (Rock). While they've shown great adaptation, the pressure might make them fall back on established patterns.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper This aggressive move anticipates their potential Rock play while giving us a necessary chance to score points in this critical endgame situation.\n"
