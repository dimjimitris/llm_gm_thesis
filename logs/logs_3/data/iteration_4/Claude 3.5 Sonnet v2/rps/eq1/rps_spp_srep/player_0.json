    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For identifying potential patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or tendencies. In such cases, it's important to consider the game theory basics of rock-paper-scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: Without any historical data, we can't predict patterns yet. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that we have no information about the opponent, we should consider a move that has balanced risk-reward. Paper would beat rock if they indeed go for a \"strong\" opening, but would lose to scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with Pattern Analyst's observation. Studies have shown that rock is statistically more likely to be chosen as an opening move by new players. Paper would be a strategic counter to this tendency.\n\nPattern Analyst: Additionally, choosing paper as our first move will give us valuable information about our opponent's initial strategy, which we can use in subsequent rounds.\n\nRisk Manager: The downside risk of choosing paper is acceptable, and the potential upside of catching a rock-throwing opponent makes it worth trying.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on the statistical tendency of new players to choose rock as an opening move, I'm choosing paper as a strategic counter.\n"

They might be using similar strategic thinking to ours\n2. They might also be trying to counter the common \"rock first\" tendency\n\nGame Strategist: When both players show similar strategic thinking, we need to think one level deeper. After a tie with paper, players often try to either:\na) Stick with paper, thinking the opponent might switch\nb) Switch to scissors to beat the previous paper\nc) Switch to rock, anticipating scissors\n\nRisk Manager: Our opponent has demonstrated some strategic sophistication by not falling into the \"rock first\" pattern. We need to consider that they might anticipate our next move.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given that sophisticated players often try to gain advantage by switching to scissors after a paper tie, we should consider this as a likely move from our opponent.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play rock. Here's why:\n1. It beats scissors if they make the expected sophisticated play\n2. If they overthink and play paper again, we only lose one point\n3. If they try to be really clever and play rock, we tie\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with this assessment.

They've shown they're willing to switch moves rather than stick with the same one.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given the psychological impact of losing, and that sophisticated players often try to counter what just beat them, paper is likely their next move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The opponent has shown strategic thinking throughout the game. They know we might stick with rock after our success, so paper would be a logical counter to that.\n\nRisk Manager: While scissors would beat their predicted paper move, it's quite aggressive.

While it's tempting to play rock again against their scissors trend, that's likely what they want us to do. They've demonstrated strategic thinking earlier in the game, so this scissors streak feels like a trap.\n\nRisk Manager: The safe play might seem to be rock given their scissors history, but I agree with the others.

Return to scissors, their historically successful move\n2. Stay with paper, expecting us to play scissors to counter their paper\n3. Switch to rock to beat our potential scissors\n\nPattern Analyst: Their timing has been impeccable throughout the game. They've consistently shown they can:\n- Outlast us in standoffs\n- Break patterns at optimal moments\n- Predict our attempts to counter them\n\nGame Strategist: When opponents demonstrate this level of strategic mastery, trying to outthink them becomes counterproductive. We need to focus on solid fundamentals rather than trying to predict their next-level thinking.\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend scissors:\n1. It's the straightforward counter to their paper\n2. If they expect us to overthink and play rock, we at least lose to a clever play\n3. If they maintain paper thinking we wouldn't make the obvious play, we win\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. They've beaten us by outthinking our attempts to outthink them. Sometimes the obvious play is best, especially against an opponent who might expect us to overcomplicate.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After they broke our rock standoff with paper, we're making the straightforward counter play rather than trying to outthink an opponent who has consistently demonstrated superior strategic thinking.\n"

We need to:\n1. Accept that they've shown superior strategic thinking\n2. Acknowledge that both complex and simple strategies have failed\n3. Try something completely different\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their moves, they've won most often by:\n- Countering our attempts to be clever\n- Matching us when we try to be basic\n- Breaking patterns at perfect moments\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, when facing a superior opponent, sometimes the best strategy is to introduce randomness - it makes you unpredictable and removes the advantage of superior prediction.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. Let's choose rock, but for a different reason than before:\n1. We're not trying to predict them anymore\n2. We're not trying to establish or break patterns\n3. Rock is simply one of three equally valid choices at this point\n4.

Neither approach has worked.\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, when facing a superior opponent who can predict both strategic and random plays, sometimes the best approach is to embrace complete uncertainty - make a choice without any reasoning at all.\n\nRisk Manager: I suggest paper:\n1.
