    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Pattern Analyst: Specialist in analyzing patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Psychology Expert: Understanding human behavior and decision-making\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: This is the first move against a fresh player. In game theory, when we have no prior information about the opponent's strategy, we should consider the Nash equilibrium, which in Rock Paper Scissors is to play each option with equal probability (1/3).\n\nPsychology Expert: In the first move of Rock Paper Scissors, many players tend to choose Rock as their opening move. This is because Rock is often perceived as a \"strong\" or \"stable\" choice. However, knowing this, some players might anticipate this and choose Paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move and we have no historical data to analyze, we can't make predictions based on patterns. However, we should keep track of moves for future rounds.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these insights, we could either go with a random choice (Nash equilibrium) or try to counter the common \"first move Rock\" tendency by playing Paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: I suggest we go with Paper for this first move. It counters the most common opening move (Rock), and even if we're wrong, we only lose one point in the worst case.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Paper is a reasonable strategic choice for the opening move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They are also using a similar strategic reasoning\n2. They might anticipate us sticking with Paper and switch to Scissors\n3. They might themselves be likely to switch since the previous move resulted in a tie\n\nPsychology Expert: Players often feel compelled to change their move after a tie, as they seek to \"win\" rather than tie again. Given that both players chose Paper, there's a psychological tendency to try something different.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the options:\n1. If we keep Paper: We risk losing to Scissors if opponent switches\n2. If we switch to Rock: We beat Scissors but lose to Paper\n3. If we switch to Scissors: We beat Paper but lose to Rock\n\nPattern Analyst: Without more established patterns, we need to consider that our opponent might be thinking along the same lines - expecting us to switch after a tie.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that both players demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing Paper first, we should expect a sophisticated response. If they expect us to switch, they might stick with Paper hoping to beat our Rock, or switch to Scissors expecting us to stay with Paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological pressure to switch after a tie is strong. I suggest we counter this expected behavior by anticipating their switch to Scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree.

Round 2: Rock vs Rock (tie)\nThe opponent seems to be following our exact moves, suggesting either:\n- They're using similar strategic reasoning\n- They're deliberately mirroring our moves\n- It's a coincidence (less likely after two matches)\n\nPsychology Expert: Two consecutive ties can create frustration and a stronger desire to break the pattern. However, the fact that our opponent has matched us twice suggests they might be a very analytical player who's using similar decision-making processes.\n\nGame Strategist: The fact that both players moved from Paper to Rock shows we're both following similar strategic thinking. Let's consider the likely next moves:\n1. Since Rock was just played, many would avoid it\n2. The natural progression in RPS is often Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n3. If our opponent is thinking similarly, they might anticipate us making the natural progression to Scissors\n\nPattern Analyst: The sequential pattern so far (Paper \u2192 Rock) suggests the natural completion would be Scissors, but that might be too obvious if our opponent is as analytical as they appear.\n\nGame Strategist: If they expect us to play Scissors, they might choose Rock to beat it. However, if they're truly mirroring our strategy, they might also arrive at the same conclusion we do.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given the demonstrated sophistication of our opponent, we should break the expected pattern. Instead of completing the natural sequence with Scissors, we should anticipate their counter to Scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Let's play Paper. This will:\n1. Beat their Rock if they're trying to counter our expected Scissors\n2. Tie if they're still mirroring us\n3.

Paper vs Scissors (we lost)\nOur opponent finally broke the mirroring pattern and successfully predicted our move. This suggests they're highly strategic and may have been analyzing our decision-making process.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a loss, players typically display one of two behaviors:\n1. They become more conservative and defensive\n2. They try to immediately recover the lost point with an aggressive move\nAlso, winners often stick with their successful move or follow up with what beats their previous move.\n\nGame Strategist: Our opponent has demonstrated sophisticated play. Let's analyze their possible thoughts:\n1. They might expect us to play Rock to counter their previous Scissors\n2. They might expect us to stick with Paper hoping they'll be overconfident and repeat Scissors\n3. They might switch to Rock anticipating our Scissors to counter their previous move\n\nPattern Analyst: This seems to be a skilled opponent who successfully broke our pattern. They might be one step ahead in predicting our responses.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they successfully predicted our last move, we need to be less predictable. The key here is to avoid being overly reactive to the previous loss.\n\nPsychology Expert: I suggest we use their potential overconfidence against them. After a win, players often feel they've \"figured out\" their opponent and might try to maintain their psychological advantage with an aggressive move.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Let's play Rock. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with their winning Scissors move (common winner's behavior), we win\n2. If they try to predict us countering their Scissors with Rock and play Paper, we lose\n3.

Feel a need to change their strategy completely\n2. Become more cautious\n3. Question their previous decision-making\nAdditionally, seeing us play Rock successfully might make them especially wary of playing Scissors again.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the opponent's possible thoughts:\n1. They just lost to Rock, so they're unlikely to play Scissors a third time\n2. They might expect us to stick with our winning Rock move\n3. The logical counter would be for them to play Paper\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent has shown they're capable of breaking patterns and thinking ahead. However, their double Scissors play suggests they can sometimes commit to a strategy too long.\n\nGame Strategist: If we assume they'll play Paper to counter our potential Rock, we could play Scissors. However, they might anticipate this and play Rock themselves.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological pressure is on them after losing their momentum. They likely feel a strong need to change their move away from Scissors. Given their demonstrated strategic thinking, they'll probably try to counter what they think we'll do.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play Scissors for these reasons:\n1. It beats Paper, which is their most logical play (countering our potential Rock)\n2. If they try to be clever and play Rock expecting our Scissors, they're actually falling into a pattern of reacting to their previous loss\n3. We're showing confidence by not sticking with our winning move (Rock)\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed.

They've now lost twice in a row.\n\nPsychology Expert: After two consecutive losses, players typically:\n1. Become more desperate to break their losing streak\n2. May revert to basic, \"safe\" moves\n3. Might become more aggressive or unpredictable\n4. Could try to completely break any perceived patterns\n\nGame Strategist: Our opponent's state analysis:\n1.

They likely realize we've successfully read their last two moves\n4. They need to break their losing streak\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent started strategic (mirroring), then became predictable (double Scissors), and their last Paper move was logically sound but predictable. They're likely to make a significant strategy shift now.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their demonstrated intelligence early in the game and their current losing streak, they're likely to:\n1. Avoid Paper (just lost with it)\n2. Possibly avoid Scissors (lost with it previously)\n3. Potentially choose Rock as a \"stable\" move to reset their strategy\n\nGame Strategist: Considering all factors, I recommend Paper for these reasons:\n1.

Individual losses don't invalidate the mathematical optimality\n2. Each move must remain independent\n3. Nash equilibrium strategy is still our best defense\n4. Trying to find patterns would make us exploitable\n\nPsychology Expert: After a loss, there's often pressure to:\n1. Avoid the losing move\n2. Try to predict opponent's next move\n3. Abandon random strategy for pattern-based thinking\nWe must resist these natural but counterproductive impulses.\n\nPattern Analyst: The loss doesn't change our fundamental approach. Random selection remains our best strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: I've generated another random number, and it corresponds to Paper. We maintain this strategy because:\n1. It ensures true unpredictability\n2. It follows game theory's optimal solution\n3. It prevents exploitation through patterns\n4. It ignores recent outcomes\n\nPsychology Expert: Perfect. The discipline to maintain random play, especially after losses, is crucial.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed.
