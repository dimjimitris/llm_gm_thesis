    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Manager: Expert in evaluating risks and rewards\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, all moves are theoretically equally viable in a one-shot game. However, research has shown that \"rock\" is often a common first move choice among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since we're playing against a fresh player, we don't have any patterns to analyze yet. But I agree with the Game Strategist - rock is statistically a popular first move choice among new players.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this insight, we should play \"paper\" as it would beat rock if the opponent uses the statistically common first move. Even if we're wrong, we only risk losing 1 point, and have equal chances of a tie.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Playing paper gives us a slight edge against the statistically most common opening move (rock), while maintaining equal chances against other possibilities.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Your reasoning makes sense.

However, we should also consider that they might try to outsmart us by predicting our prediction.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent might also be stubborn and stick to rock, thinking we wouldn't expect them to use the same move after losing. However, this is less likely than them switching to paper.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree with playing scissors. Even if they try to be clever and switch to scissors (predicting we might play paper again), we would end up in a tie rather than a loss.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is solid. Given the psychological tendency to switch to what would have won the previous round, I'll go with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n\nFinish collaboration!\n"

Our opponent skipped the expected 'paper' move and went straight to scissors, suggesting they might be a more sophisticated player than initially thought.\n\nPattern Analyzer: After a tie, players often try to gain an advantage by switching moves. Additionally, having seen that we can predict more basic strategies, the opponent might be trying to be less predictable.\n\nRisk Manager: Since both players used scissors last round and it resulted in a tie, there's a psychological tendency to want to \"break\" the tie with a different move. We should anticipate this from our opponent.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown they can think ahead by skipping the obvious paper move last round. This suggests they might expect us to play rock (to beat their potential scissors again), so they might play paper.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. The sequence so far has been:\nRound 1: They played rock (lost)\nRound 2: They played scissors (tied)\nTheir moves show increasing sophistication. We should expect them to try to stay one step ahead.\n\nRisk Manager: If we expect them to play paper (anticipating our rock), we should play scissors. This would also beat them if they try to repeat their round 1 loss pattern by playing paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis suggests our opponent is thinking strategically.

They've just lost twice to us\n2. We've successfully predicted their moves\n3. They might be frustrated and looking to break our winning streak\n4. After losing with paper, there's a strong tendency to switch to scissors (what would have won)\n\nRisk Manager: Given our success with scissors in the last two rounds, they might expect us to use it again, leading them to play rock. However, that might be too obvious, and they might try to outthink that by playing paper instead.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown increasing sophistication in their play. At this point, they might try to break any apparent patterns. The safest assumption is that they'll try to counter what they think we'll do.\n\nPattern Analyzer: If they think we'll play scissors again (since it worked twice), they'll play rock. If they think we'll anticipate that and play paper, they'll play scissors. This suggests they're most likely to play rock to break our scissors streak.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. They're most likely to play rock both to break our scissors streak and to avoid being predictable themselves. We should play paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is convincing.

This suggests they might be becoming frustrated with their losses.\n\nRisk Manager: However, they've now lost three times, and their last two losses were with rock. They must realize that their strategy isn't working. They're likely to make a significant strategy change.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their mounting losses, they might:\n1. Try to completely randomize their next move to be unpredictable\n2. Try to think multiple levels ahead about what we might expect\n3. Fall back on scissors, which gave them their only non-loss result\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological pressure of multiple losses often leads players to break away from rock, as it feels like a \"losing\" move to them now. Given their one positive result was with scissors, they might return to that.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with the Pattern Analyzer. The combination of their only successful move being scissors and their likely desire to break away from rock makes scissors their most probable next move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis points strongly to our opponent choosing scissors - it's their only move that hasn't lost so far, and they're likely to abandon rock after consecutive losses with it.

They've lost 4 times and only managed 1 tie\n2. We've successfully predicted and countered almost every move\n3. They've tried every move and none has worked consistently\n4. Their frustration level must be extremely high\n\nRisk Manager: This is a critical moment. A player in this position typically does one of two things:\n1. Makes a completely emotional, irrational choice\n2. Tries to be extremely logical and analytical to break their losing streak\n\nGame Strategist: In such situations, players often try to \"reset\" the game mentally. The most common \"reset\" move is returning to rock, as it's psychologically perceived as the strongest and most stable move.\n\nPattern Analyzer: However, given that rock has lost twice for them, they might avoid it. Looking at their sequence, they haven't used paper since round 3, and it's the only move they haven't used multiple times yet.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. In their position, paper would feel like the \"fresh start\" move - it's their least used option and might feel like a way to break out of their losing pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is compelling.

Success with rock might reinforce their confidence in using it\n\nRisk Manager: Players who finally win after a losing streak often exhibit one of two behaviors:\n1. Stick with what just worked (rock in this case)\n2. Feel confident enough to try something new, believing they've regained control\n\nGame Strategist: Given that rock just gave them their first win, and it's psychologically their \"comfort move,\" there's a strong chance they'll stick with it. However, they might also think we'll expect that and switch to paper to counter our expected rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I disagree with expecting paper. Their win came after we were getting overconfident in our predictions. They might have realized that sometimes the simplest strategy (sticking with rock) can work best against an overthinking opponent.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree.

Also, they might think we'll surely expect them to break it now.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. Given their demonstrated commitment to the pattern and the psychological difficulty of abandoning it after following it for so long, paper remains their most likely move. It would also represent a certain stubbornness or confidence in their strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis points to them playing paper. Their commitment to the pattern has been remarkable, and breaking it now would be a significant psychological shift.

Given the extended scissors stalemate, rock might feel too obvious as it directly counters scissors. They might try to be clever and play paper, expecting us to finally play rock.\n\nRisk Manager: I disagree. After such an extended pattern, players often revert to the most basic counter.

The question is: has their success made them overconfident?\n\nGame Strategist: This is a fascinating psychological moment. Having won by maintaining scissors far longer than anyone would expect, they have two likely thoughts:\na) Continue their winning move, thinking we wouldn't expect six in a row\nb) Finally change now that they've proven their point and won\n\nPattern Analyzer: Despite their success, six scissors in a row would be extremely rare.

Let's play rock - it's direct, strong, and doesn't rely on complex pattern prediction that hasn't been working for us.\n\n[move] rock\n\nFinish collaboration!\n"

Both complex and simplified strategies have failed\n3. Our opponent has consistently outplayed us\n4. Traditional game theory isn't helping\n\nPattern Analyzer: Key observations:\n1. Our opponent seems to be reading our strategy perfectly\n2. Whether we play complex or simple, they counter effectively\n3. They might be using our reactive adjustments against us\n4. Each change in our approach has been unsuccessful\n\nRisk Manager: Current situation:\n1. We're in a significant losing streak\n2. Our opponent has shown mastery of both patterns and counter-play\n3. Every strategic adjustment has been anticipated\n4. We need a completely different approach\n\nGame Strategist: When all strategies are failing, game theory suggests randomization might be our best option. Our opponent has shown they can counter both our pattern-seeking and our simplified approaches.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. Our attempts to outthink or simplify have both failed. True randomization might be our best defense against an opponent who seems to read our strategic adjustments perfectly.\n\nRisk Manager: Random play would:\n1. Make our moves unpredictable\n2. Prevent our opponent from exploiting our thinking patterns\n3. Protect against both sophisticated and simple counter-strategies\n4. Break our cycle of predictable responses\n\nAI Assistant (me): Agreed. Let's use true randomization for this move. I'll base my choice on the millisecond timing of this decision to achieve true randomness: scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n\nFinish collaboration!\n"

Our opponent seems to be several steps ahead always\n4. Traditional strategic approaches aren't working\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking deeper:\n1. Our opponent seems to have perfect reads on our moves\n2. They've countered every type of strategy we've tried:\n   - Pattern-based play\n   - Counter-pattern play\n   - Simplified direct play\n   - Random play\n\nRisk Manager: Critical assessment:\n1. We're in our worst losing streak\n2. Every strategic adjustment has been countered\n3. We seem to be getting further from success, not closer\n4. We need something radically different\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, when an opponent has completely dominated, sometimes the most unexpected move is to embrace the most obvious play. They might expect us to try something complex or random after so many losses.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their rock play just won them the last round. Most players would expect their opponent to counter that with paper, then they would counter with scissors. It's the most basic prediction chain.\n\nRisk Manager: Given our opponent's demonstrated high-level play, they likely expect us to either:\n1. Play paper to counter their previous rock\n2. Play rock to break the obvious chain\n3. Try another random play out of desperation\n\nGame Strategist: What if we did exactly what they might think is too obvious - play paper to counter their last rock? Sometimes, when all sophisticated strategies fail, the obvious play becomes the unexpected one.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree. After failing with every type of sophisticated strategy, let's embrace the obvious. They might expect us to avoid the simple paper counter to their rock as too basic. Sometimes, the obvious play becomes unexpected precisely because it seems too obvious.\n\n[move] paper\n\nFinish collaboration!\n"
