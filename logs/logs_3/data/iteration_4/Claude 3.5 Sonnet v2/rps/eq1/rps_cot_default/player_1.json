The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My recent sequence has been scissors->paper->rock, moving from losses to a tie.\n\n[move] scissors While rock-rock ties often lead players to choose paper next, I'm choosing scissors because: 1) If they follow the common pattern and switch to paper to beat rock, scissors wins, 2) If they expect me to play paper to beat their rock and they choose scissors, we'll tie, 3) If they stay with rock, I'll lose, but that seems less likely as they've shown they're willing to make aggressive plays when they see a pattern forming. After a tie, there's often a psychological urge to try to win decisively rather than play defensively.\n"

My recent sequence has been paper->rock->scissors, cycling through all moves with two consecutive ties.\n\n[move] rock After we both played scissors, this is my reasoning: 1) Following two ties, there's increased pressure to find a winning move, which might make my opponent more aggressive, 2) They might expect me to play paper thinking they'll play rock (a common follow-up to scissors), making scissors their choice - my rock would beat this, 3) If they play rock too, we tie again, which is better than losing. Rock provides a good balance of offensive potential while protecting against the most likely aggressive response after consecutive ties.\n"

My recent sequence has been rock->scissors->rock, with improving results (tie->tie->win). This win breaks a streak of ties and gives me momentum.\n\n[move] paper My reasoning: 1) After losing to rock, they might play rock themselves either to copy my successful move or as a safe defensive choice - paper beats both these scenarios, 2) If they expect me to repeat rock after it worked and play paper, we'll tie rather than lose, 3) If they try scissors expecting me to play paper (which I am), that would require them to make an aggressive play right after losing. Given their recent tendency toward aggressive plays that got punished, they might play more conservatively now, making paper a strong choice.\n"
