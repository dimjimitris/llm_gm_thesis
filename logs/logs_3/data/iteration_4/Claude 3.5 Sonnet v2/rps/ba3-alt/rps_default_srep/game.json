Following their behavior:\n1. They have returned to scissors, a move they used successfully before\n2. After ties, they sometimes stick with the same move hoping opponent will switch\n3. They might anticipate me playing paper to counter their scissors\n\nI'm choosing rock because:\n- If they stick with scissors (which they might after our tie), I win 1 point\n- If they switch to paper, I lose 3 points\n- If they play rock, it's a tie\n\nGiven their recent return to scissors and the tendency to stick with moves after ties, rock seems like a reasonable counter-strategy here.\n"
