They're either using extremely similar logic to mine\n2. They've found a way to perfectly predict my choices\n3. We're both caught in a similar thinking pattern\n\nThe pressure of breaking this tie streak is immense. After scissors, the conventional wisdom would suggest rock or paper. They've shown they can match \"logical\" moves perfectly.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to stay with scissors. Here's why:\n- It's the least expected move (staying with the same move after such a long tie streak)\n- If they think I'll definitely switch, they might play paper (expecting my rock)\n- If they also stay with scissors, at least the tie streak continues\n\n[move] scissors After eight ties, I'm staying with scissors, defying the expectation to switch.\n"
