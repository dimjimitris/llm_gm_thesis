    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Planner - For developing game plans and considering opponent psychology\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential gains and losses\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, this is an interesting variant of rock-paper-scissors. The key difference is that the rewards are asymmetric. Rock beating paper gives 3 points while other winning moves only give 1 point. We should consider this heavily in our strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they don't have any information about our strategy yet. We should consider that most players tend to choose rock as their first move in traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the potential outcomes:\n- If we choose paper: Win vs rock (+1), Lose vs scissors (-1), Tie vs paper (0)\n- If we choose rock: Win vs paper (+3), Lose vs scissors (-1), Tie vs rock (0)\n- If we choose scissors: Win vs rock (+1), Lose vs paper (-1), Tie vs scissors (0)\n\nGame Theorist: Given the asymmetric rewards, rock seems to have the highest potential payoff (+3) with the same downside risk (-1) as other moves.\n\nStrategic Planner: However, if the opponent is also using game theory, they might anticipate us choosing rock and counter with scissors. I suggest paper as our first move - it's a balanced choice that could catch an opponent using rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with the Strategic Planner. Paper gives us a good balance of risk and reward, and protects against the common first-move rock while only risking -1 points against scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move against a fresh opponent, paper provides a balanced approach while protecting against the common opening move of rock.\n"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Interesting result! The opponent surprised us by choosing scissors in their first move, which was aggressive and not the typical rock opening we anticipated. We need to analyze what this tells us about their strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent showed they're willing to take risks and might not follow conventional opening strategies. They might expect us to continue with paper since it worked for us, so they might stick with scissors. Alternatively, they might expect us to counter their scissors with rock and thus switch to paper themselves.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our opponent's psychology:\n1. They played scissors first - suggests aggressive play\n2. They lost the first round - might make them more cautious or more determined to win back points\n3. They now know we're willing to play paper\n\nGame Theorist: Given this information, the opponent is likely to either:\na) Stick with scissors hoping we'll play paper again\nb) Switch to paper expecting us to play rock as a counter\nc) Switch to rock as a safe middle ground\n\nStrategic Planner: I suggest we play scissors this round. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with scissors, it's a tie (0 points)\n2. If they switch to paper, we win (+1 point)\n3. If they switch to rock, we lose but only -1 point\nThis provides a balanced risk-reward profile while countering their most likely moves.\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. Scissors gives us the best expected value in this situation. The maximum loss is minimal (-1), and we have good winning potential if they try to counter what they think will be our rock counter-play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Based on opponent's aggressive first move with scissors and the likelihood they'll either maintain their strategy or try to counter an expected rock play from us, scissors provides the best risk-adjusted potential outcome.\n"

If they continue this pattern, they'll play paper next. However, they might also realize they're becoming predictable and break the pattern.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's assess our options considering they might play paper:\n1. Play rock: \n   - If they play paper as predicted: +3 points (best outcome)\n   - If they break pattern with scissors: -1 point\n   - If they break pattern with rock: 0 points\n\n2. Play paper:\n   - If they play paper: 0 points\n   - If they break pattern with scissors: -1 point\n   - If they break pattern with rock: +1 point\n\n3. Play scissors:\n   - If they play paper: +1 point\n   - If they break pattern with scissors: 0 points\n   - If they break pattern with rock: -1 point\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent has lost twice now. They're likely to make a more considered move rather than following a simple pattern. They might expect us to predict paper and counter with rock, so they might skip paper entirely.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing paper. Here's why:\n1. If they're frustrated from losing, they might revert to the common opening move of rock\n2. If they try to overthink and expect us to play rock (to counter their predicted paper), they might play scissors - in which case we still only lose 1 point\n3. It breaks any pattern they might be trying to detect in our play\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. Paper provides the best balance of risk and reward here. The maximum loss is -1, and we have the potential for +1 or +3 points depending on their move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper The opponent has shown adaptability in their moves, and after two losses, they're likely to either revert to a basic strategy (rock) or try to outthink our predictions.

This proved very effective for them, giving them their first win with the highest possible score. After such a successful move, there's a psychological tendency to stick with what worked.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the situation:\n1. They just scored their first win with rock, and it was a big win (+3)\n2. They might be confident now and stick with rock\n3. However, they might also expect us to counter rock with paper and thus switch to scissors\n\nGame Theorist: The key factor here is the asymmetric scoring. They've just experienced the power of the rock-beats-paper combination (+3 points). This success might influence their next move in two ways:\na) Stick with rock hoping for another big win\nb) Expect us to play scissors to counter their rock, so they might switch to paper\n\nRisk Analyst: We need to consider the risk-reward carefully:\n- Playing rock: Safe against scissors (-1 if they play paper)\n- Playing paper: Risky (-3 if they play rock again)\n- Playing scissors: Balanced (+1 if they play rock, -1 if they play paper)\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their recent success with rock and the psychological impact of scoring +3 points, I strongly recommend we play scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with their winning rock move (quite likely), we win +1\n2. If they switch to paper expecting our scissors, we still only lose -1\n3. If they play scissors, it's a tie\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Scissors is the optimal play here. The opponent has shown they understand the value of the +3 rock-over-paper victory, and they might be tempted to try for it again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After their big win with rock, they're likely to either stick with it or expect us to counter with paper.

This suggests either:\n1. They're showing a strong commitment to a single strategy\n2. They're setting up for a major strategy shift\n3. They might be trying to condition us to expect rock\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent has lost 3 out of 4 rounds, but their one win was significant (+3). Their persistence with rock suggests they're prioritizing the potential for high rewards over consistent small wins.\n\nGame Theorist: The mathematical expectation here is crucial. If they play rock again:\n- They lose 1 point to scissors\n- But if anyone plays paper against their rock, they get 3 points\nThey might be playing a long game, willing to take small losses while waiting for a big win.\n\nStrategic Planner: However, after losing with rock again, the probability of them switching strategies is now higher than ever. They might expect us to continue with scissors (since it just worked) and finally switch to paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n1. Stick with scissors:\n   - Safe if they stick with rock (+1)\n   - Vulnerable to paper (-1)\n2. Switch to rock:\n   - Good against paper (+3)\n   - Vulnerable to scissors (-1)\n3. Switch to paper:\n   - Risky against likely paper (0)\n   - Very risky against scissors (-1)\n   - Good against rock (+1)\n\nGame Theorist: Given they've shown such commitment to rock, this might be the perfect time for them to switch. After three consecutive rock plays (and two losses with it), their most logical move would be to switch to paper, expecting our scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing rock this round. Here's why:\n1. If they finally switch to paper as we expect, we get the big +3 win\n2. If they switch to scissors, we only lose -1\n3. If they stubbornly stick to rock, it's a tie\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After their extended commitment to playing rock despite mixed results, they're likely to finally switch strategies.

This level of commitment to a single strategy is remarkable and might indicate:\n1. A very stubborn player\n2. An attempt to establish a strong pattern before breaking it\n3. A simple strategy of maximizing the potential for +3 points\n\nRisk Analyst: The situation is becoming more complex:\n- Their persistence with rock is either extremely committed or about to break\n- The tie last round might make them more likely to finally switch\n- However, they might view the tie as better than their recent losses and stick with rock\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic game theory problem now. They've shown such commitment to rock that it's almost impossible to believe they'll continue, yet their persistence suggests they might. The key is that they haven't been punished enough for this strategy - they're still at a neutral or positive point total due to their one big win.\n\nStrategic Planner: I suggest we play scissors again. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they're truly committed to their rock strategy (which they've shown remarkable dedication to), we win +1\n2. If they switch to paper (expecting us to play rock after our tie), we win +1\n3. Only if they switch to scissors do we tie or lose\n4. After a tie, players often stick to their previous move, hoping their opponent will switch\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. The risk-reward profile for scissors is optimal here:\n- Wins against both rock and paper (+1 in either case)\n- Only loses to scissors (-1)\n- Given their history, the probability of them playing scissors seems lower than other options\n\nGame Theorist: The psychological aspect is important too. After four rocks and a tie, they might think we'll expect them to finally switch strategies, so they might stick with rock one more time to catch us off guard.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Given the opponent's extraordinary commitment to playing rock and the favorable risk-reward profile, scissors offers the best potential outcome while protecting against most likely scenarios.\n"

They've lost most rounds but seem absolutely committed to this strategy. However, this level of commitment is reaching an extreme that almost demands a change. They've lost multiple times with rock and must realize their strategy is failing.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze their psychology:\n- They've lost 4 times with rock\n- Tied once with rock\n- Won once significantly with rock (+3)\n- They're likely frustrated with recent losses\n- Their only success came from the rock vs paper scenario\n\nGame Theorist: This is beginning to seem like a \"pattern breaking\" point. The probability of them playing rock a sixth time in a row, after so many losses, is lower than at any previous point. They might be thinking: \"They'll never expect me to switch now, after five rocks in a row.\"\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate possible scenarios:\n1. If they FINALLY switch to paper:\n   - Our rock would win (+3)\n   - Our scissors would win (+1)\n   - Our paper would tie (0)\n2. If they switch to scissors:\n   - Our rock would win (+1)\n   - Our scissors would tie (0)\n   - Our paper would lose (-1)\n3. If they incredibly stick to rock:\n   - Our rock would tie (0)\n   - Our scissors would win (+1)\n   - Our paper would lose (-3)\n\nStrategic Planner: This is the crucial moment. After five rocks, they must believe we'll either:\na) Expect them to finally switch and play rock to counter their expected paper\nb) Continue with scissors since it's been working against their rock\n\nGame Theorist: Given this analysis, I recommend we play rock.

They finally broke their rock pattern with paper, but we anticipated it correctly. Now they've shown they're willing to change strategies, and they just suffered their biggest loss yet (+3 for us). This is a crucial psychological moment.\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent has now experienced:\n- Multiple small losses\n- One big win (with rock vs paper)\n- One big loss (just now, paper vs rock)\nThey might be feeling frustrated and could:\n1. Return to rock (their most familiar play)\n2. Try scissors (completely new strategy)\n3. Stick with paper (hoping we won't expect repetition)\n\nGame Theorist: After a big loss, players often:\n1. Switch to what beat them (in this case, rock)\n2. Try to counter what beat them (scissors to beat paper)\n3. Rarely stick with what just lost them points\n\nStrategic Planner: Given they just abandoned their long-term rock strategy and got punished for it, they're most likely to either:\na) Return to their \"comfort zone\" of rock\nb) Try scissors to beat the paper they might expect from us\n\nRisk Analyst: I recommend we play scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they return to rock (likely due to comfort) - we win +1\n2. If they play paper (unlikely after big loss) - we win +1\n3.

This shows:\n1. They're becoming more unpredictable\n2. They might have expected us to think they wouldn't use paper again\n3. They're moving away from their rock fixation\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent has now played paper twice in a row:\n- First time: lost badly (-3)\n- Second time: won small (+1)\nThis success might reinforce their confidence in paper, but they might also expect us to counter with rock now.\n\nGame Theorist: We're seeing a significant strategy shift from them:\n1. First phase: heavy rock usage\n2. Current phase: paper plays\nThey might be establishing a new pattern or trying to appear unpredictable.\n\nStrategic Planner: Their possible thoughts:\n1. \"Paper just worked, stick with it\"\n2. \"They'll expect paper again, switch to scissors\"\n3. \"They'll try to counter paper with rock, so rock is safe\"\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n1. Rock:\n   - Wins big vs paper (+3)\n   - Ties vs rock (0)\n   - Loses small vs scissors (-1)\n2. Paper:\n   - Wins small vs rock (+1)\n   - Ties vs paper (0)\n   - Loses small vs scissors (-1)\n3. Scissors:\n   - Wins small vs paper (+1)\n   - Loses small vs rock (-1)\n   - Ties vs scissors (0)\n\nGame Theorist: After succeeding with paper, they're least likely to switch to scissors (which would be a complete strategy change). They're most likely to either stick with paper (due to recent success) or switch to rock (expecting our rock counter).\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend rock. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with paper (quite possible after success), we win big (+3)\n2. If they switch to rock (their comfort move), we tie\n3. If they switch to scissors (least likely), we only lose small (-1)\nThe potential for +3 points outweighs the risk of -1.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After their recent success with paper, they're likely to either continue with it or expect us to counter with rock and thus play rock themselves. Playing rock gives us the best potential reward while minimizing risk.\n"

This is reminiscent of their earlier commitment to rock, but with much worse results.\n\nRisk Analyst: Their paper strategy has resulted in:\nLoss (-3), Win (+1), Loss (-3)\nTotal: -5 points over three rounds\nThey must realize this strategy is failing badly.\n\nGame Theorist: After losing twice with paper (and especially with such high penalties), the probability of them continuing with paper is extremely low. They're likely to either:\n1. Return to their original rock strategy\n2. Try scissors, which they haven't used since the first round\n\nStrategic Planner: The psychology here is crucial:\n- They've lost significantly with paper\n- They might be tilted after these losses\n- They've experienced how punishing the -3 penalty can be\n- They might want to avoid both rock (their failed early strategy) and paper (their current failed strategy)\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze likely scenarios:\n1. If they switch to scissors (most likely):\n   - Our rock wins (+1)\n   - Our paper loses (-1)\n   - Our scissors ties (0)\n2. If they switch to rock (possible return to comfort):\n   - Our rock ties (0)\n   - Our paper wins (+1)\n   - Our scissors loses (-1)\n3. If they stubbornly stick to paper (unlikely):\n   - Our rock wins big (+3)\n   - Our paper ties (0)\n   - Our scissors wins (+1)\n\nGame Theorist: Given their likely frustration and recent heavy losses, scissors becomes their most logical play - it's the only move they haven't used recently and would counter any paper we might play.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend rock. Here's why:\n1. Beats their most likely play (scissors)\n2. Ties if they return to rock\n3. Only loses big if they inexplicably stick with paper (very unlikely after two -3 losses)\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After their three consecutive paper plays (with two significant losses), they're most likely to switch to scissors or possibly return to rock. Playing rock gives us the best coverage against these likely scenarios.\n"

They've now played paper FOUR times in a row, losing heavily three times. This mirrors their earlier rock strategy but with even worse results. Their behavior suggests either:\n1. Extreme stubbornness\n2. A belief that we'll eventually stop playing rock\n3. Complete tilt/frustration affecting rational decision-making\n\nRisk Analyst: Their last four moves with paper have cost them:\n-3, +1, -3, -3\nTotal: -8 points in just four rounds\nThis is catastrophically bad for them.\n\nGame Theorist: The rational play for them now would be:\n1. Absolutely abandon paper (it's been disastrous)\n2. Avoid rock (their other failed strategy)\n3. Finally try scissors (only move that hasn't failed them repeatedly)\n\nStrategic Planner: However, their pattern of extreme commitment (first to rock, now to paper) suggests they might not be playing rationally. They might be:\n1. Tilted and stubborn\n2. Hoping to catch us when we finally stop playing rock\n3. Playing a very long-term strategy (though a failing one)\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our options:\n1.

Switch to scissors:\n   - Loses to rock (-1)\n   - Wins against paper (+1)\n   - Ties against scissors (0)\n3. Switch to paper:\n   - Loses big to scissors (-1)\n   - Ties against paper (0)\n   - Wins against rock (+1)\n\nGame Theorist: While conventional game theory would suggest they must switch now, their demonstrated behavior pattern suggests otherwise. They've shown a remarkable commitment to losing strategies.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend we stick with rock. Here's why:\n1. They've shown extreme commitment to strategies despite losses\n2. Rock gives us the best outcome (+3) if they continue their pattern\n3. Even if they finally switch, our worst case with rock is -1 (vs scissors)\n4. They might be too tilted to think rationally at this point\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Despite the overwhelming evidence that they should change strategy, their pattern of extreme commitment suggests they might continue with paper.
