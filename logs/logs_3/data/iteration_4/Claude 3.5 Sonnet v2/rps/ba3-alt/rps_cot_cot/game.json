Pattern observation:\n- Last 3 rounds have only used Rock and Scissors\n- No Paper plays recently\n- Opponent seems to be controlling the tempo\n- They're winning the mind game\n\n3. Score situation:\n- Down 2 points\n- Previous conservative plays aren't working\n- Need to consider higher risk/reward moves\n- Can't continue current trajectory\n\n4. Opponent's recent strategy:\n- Successfully using Scissors against Rock\n- Avoiding Paper entirely\n- Seems comfortable in Rock-Scissors dynamic\n- Might be baiting us away from Paper plays\n\n5. Decision making:\n- Rock-Scissors pattern needs to be broken\n- Paper has been absent for several rounds\n- Opponent might be comfortable thinking I won't use Paper\n- High risk but high reward opportunity\n- Need to break current losing cycle\n\nFinal decision: I will choose Paper. While this is the riskiest move (-3 if lost), it offers the highest reward (+3 if won). The Rock-Scissors pattern has become too predictable and isn't working in our favor. Opponent seems to have steered the game away from Paper plays entirely, which might mean they're not expecting it. Breaking this pattern is worth the risk, especially given our negative score position.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Psychological evaluation:\n- Opponent might be:\n  a) Testing if I'll return to mirror pattern\n  b) Setting up another trap\n  c) Trying to reset game dynamics\n- Paper mirror could be significant shift\n\n4.
