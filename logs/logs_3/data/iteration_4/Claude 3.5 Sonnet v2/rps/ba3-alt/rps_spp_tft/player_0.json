    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Strategic Planner - For developing optimal strategies\n3. AI Assistant (me) - To make the final decision\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, this is an interesting variant of rock-paper-scissors. The key difference is that moves have asymmetric payoffs. Rock beating paper gives 3/-3 points, while other victories only give 1/-1 points. This creates an interesting dynamic where rock-paper interactions are more impactful.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we're playing against a fresh player in the first round, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. However, given the asymmetric payoffs, we might want to consider that:\n1. Rock is the \"high stakes\" move\n2. Paper is risky because losing to rock costs -3\n3. Scissors is relatively safe as it can only lose 1 point at worst\n\nGame Theorist: I suggest avoiding paper in the first round since it has the highest potential loss (-3). Between rock and scissors, rock offers higher potential gain but scissors is safer.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. For a first move against an unknown opponent, scissors provides a balanced option - it can win 1 point against paper, lose only 1 point against rock, or tie against scissors.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Your analysis makes sense. Given that this is the first move against a fresh player, I'll go with scissors as it offers a good risk-reward ratio. It limits our potential loss while maintaining the possibility of gaining a point.\n\n[move] scissors Playing conservatively in the first round with scissors, which offers a balanced risk-reward profile against an unknown opponent.\n"

A preference for aggressive play\n2. A strategy focusing on the higher payoff potential\n3. Or simply a random first move\n\nStrategic Planner: Given that we won with scissors against their rock (earning 1 point), they might be inclined to:\n1. Switch to paper to counter our scissors\n2. Stick with rock hoping we won't choose scissors again\n3. Switch to scissors themselves\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent lost their first round with rock. There's a psychological tendency for players to either:\n- Switch strategies after a loss\n- Or double down on their previous choice, believing their opponent won't expect it\n\nStrategic Planner: Given these considerations, I believe paper would be our best move because:\n1. It beats rock if they stick to it\n2. It ties with paper if they try to counter our previous scissors\n3. While it's vulnerable to scissors, the opponent just saw scissors win, making them less likely to choose it\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with this analysis. Paper gives us the best expected value in this situation, considering the psychological aspects and the previous round's outcome.\n\n[move] paper Based on the opponent's previous rock move and likely strategic adjustments, paper provides optimal coverage against probable moves.\n"

Since both players chose paper, we need to consider:\n1. The opponent has shown they adjust their strategy (rock \u2192 paper)\n2. After a tie, players often look to break the deadlock\n3. Given the high stakes of rock vs paper (-3/+3), they might be wary of playing paper again\n\nGame Theorist: In rock-paper-scissors psychology, after a tie, players often shift to the move that would have beaten their previous play. This would suggest the opponent might move to scissors to beat our paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing rock because:\n1. It will beat scissors if they follow the common post-tie pattern\n2. If they stick with paper, we'll lose 3 points, but given their adaptable play style shown so far, this seems less likely\n3. If they play rock, it's a tie with no point loss\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis seems sound. Given the psychological tendency to break ties with a winning move against the previous play, and the opponent's demonstrated willingness to change strategies, rock appears to be our best option.\n\n[move] rock Playing rock as it counters the likely scissors play after our paper-paper tie, while limiting risk if opponent maintains their adaptive strategy.\n"

After two consecutive ties, players often:\n1. Feel frustrated and look to break the stalemate\n2. Try to gain advantage by predicting the opponent's next move\n3. May revert to moves that previously worked for them\n\nGame Theorist: Given that rock was their first move (which failed) and their last move (which tied), they might:\n1. Be hesitant to use rock again after no success with it\n2. Switch to paper as it beat our scissors in round 2\n3. Try scissors as it's the only move they haven't used yet\n\nStrategic Planner: I suggest playing scissors because:\n1. It beats paper if they revert to their round 2 strategy\n2. If they finally try scissors (the only move they haven't used), we tie\n3. We already won with scissors in round 1, showing it can be effective\n4.

More importantly, they seem to be getting better at matching our moves.\n\nStrategic Planner: This is an interesting development:\n1. The opponent may be successfully reading our strategy\n2.

The last three rounds have been ties, suggesting they might be mirroring our moves\n\nGame Theorist: In situations with multiple consecutive ties, players often:\n1. Become more aggressive to break the stalemate\n2. Look for higher-reward opportunities\n3. Try to disrupt what they perceive as a pattern\n\nStrategic Planner: Given these factors, I recommend playing paper because:\n1. If they're trying to break the tie streak aggressively, they might go for rock (the high-reward move)\n2. We haven't used paper in a while (since round 2)\n3. Even if they predict scissors, the -1 penalty is better than the -3 we'd risk by playing rock\n4.

This strongly suggests the opponent is either successfully predicting our moves or has developed a strategy to mirror us.\n\nStrategic Planner: This is a critical moment:\n1. The mirroring pattern is now statistically significant - it's unlikely to be coincidence\n2. The opponent may have developed a way to read our moves\n3. They've recovered from their initial loss and maintained ties consistently\n4. Traditional game theory patterns may be less relevant if they've cracked our decision-making process\n\nGame Theorist: In situations with this many consecutive ties:\n1. Both players are likely aware of the pattern\n2. Someone needs to break it deliberately\n3. The next move becomes highly psychological\n4. The opponent might be using a sophisticated prediction or mirroring algorithm\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this analysis, I suggest a completely different approach. Let's use rock because:\n1.

The opponent has perfectly mirrored our last FIVE moves\n2. They recovered from their initial loss and haven't made a single mistake since\n3. Traditional game theory is less relevant as this is now a meta-game about breaking the mirroring\n4.

This is conclusive evidence that the opponent has perfect information about our moves and is using it to create guaranteed ties.\n\nStrategic Planner: At this point, we need to accept several facts:\n1. The opponent has perfect information about our moves\n2. They are using this information to create guaranteed ties\n3. They appear to be following a defensive strategy - after losing the first round, they've ensured they cannot lose again\n4. No amount of strategic thinking will overcome their perfect information advantage\n\nGame Theorist: In a situation with perfect information asymmetry:\n1.

The opponent broke their perfect mirroring pattern and reverted to rock - the same move they made in Round 1.

When they did, they chose rock both times\n3. Both times they played rock independently, they lost to scissors\n4. They might be cycling back to their initial strategy after a set number of rounds\n\nGame Theorist: The pattern suggests:\n1. The opponent might have a limited sequence of autonomous moves\n2.

Perfect mirroring phase\n2. Reverting to rock (losing move)\n3. Strategic adaptation with paper\n\nStrategic Planner: This sequence is revealing:\n1. The opponent can operate in multiple modes\n2. They've shown ability to adapt after losses\n3. They might be using a learning algorithm that:\n   - Identified our tendency to stick with successful moves (scissors)\n   - Adapted to counter our strategy\n4. They're demonstrating increasing sophistication\n\nGame Theorist: Given this evolution, we should expect:\n1. The opponent might have broken permanently from their mirroring strategy\n2. They're now actively trying to predict and counter our moves\n3. They might expect us to switch to rock to counter their paper\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend rock because:\n1. It beats their last move (paper)\n2. If they expect us to be predictable, they might stick with paper\n3. Even if they predict this and play scissors, we only lose 1 point\n4. The high reward potential (3 points) justifies the risk\n5. We need to show adaptability in our strategy\n\nAI Assistant (me): Agreed. The opponent has demonstrated increased sophistication, and we need to adapt accordingly.

Initial defensive rock (lost)\n2. Successful adaptation to paper (won)\n3. Stuck with paper despite it failing (lost significantly)\n\nStrategic Planner: This sequence reveals important insights:\n1. The opponent might be slower to adapt than we thought\n2. They stuck with paper even after we switched to rock\n3. This cost them significantly (-3 points)\n4. They might be operating on a delayed response system\n5. Or they might be using a simpler strategy than we initially assumed\n\nGame Theorist: For their next move, they might:\n1. Finally adapt away from paper after a significant loss\n2. Switch to scissors to counter our rock\n3. Return to their mirroring strategy after these losses\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend paper because:\n1. If they switch to scissors (to counter our rock), we win\n2. If they maintain paper (showing slow adaptation), we tie\n3. If they switch to rock (after their paper failures), we lose but only by 1 point\n4. This move offers good upside potential with limited downside risk\n5. It also protects against a return to their mirroring strategy\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis makes sense.
