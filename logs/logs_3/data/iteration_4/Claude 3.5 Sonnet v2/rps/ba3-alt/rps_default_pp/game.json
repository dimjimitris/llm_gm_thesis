Let's review:\nRound 12: They played paper (lost -1)\nRound 13: They played scissors (lost -1)\nRound 14: They played rock (lost -3)\nRound 15: They played paper (lost -1)\nRound 16: They played scissors (lost -1)\n\nOur total score is now -13, and we've lost every recent round. What's particularly interesting is that our opponent has consistently managed to:\n1. Counter every strategic approach we've tried\n2. Beat us whether we play predictably or unpredictably\n3. Win regardless of whether we try to minimize risk or maximize reward\n\nSince our commitment to rock in the last round still resulted in a loss, let's continue with our \"stick to one move\" strategy but switch the move. This could either:\n- Force a pattern that our opponent might not expect\n- Break their ability to predict our next move\n- Or at least help us understand their response to consistency\n\n[move] paper Maintaining our single-move strategy but switching to paper\n"
