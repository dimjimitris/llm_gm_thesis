This shows:\n1. They surprisingly maintained the same move after a big loss\n2. They've now lost 6 points in two consecutive rounds\n3. They must be feeling pressure to change strategy now\n\nAfter two consecutive big losses with paper, they almost certainly will switch. They might:\n- Switch to scissors as an aggressive counter\n- Switch to rock seeking a high-reward comeback\n- Very unlikely to use paper a third time after two big losses\n\nGiven these two big losses and their earlier patterns of switching after losses, I believe they're most likely to switch to scissors as a direct counter to my successful rock plays. I'll stick with rock - it beats scissors (3 points) and I think the probability of them using paper a third time after losing 6 points with it is very low.\n\n[move] rock\n"
