    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - Specializes in evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n3. Pattern Analyzer - Skilled at identifying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. We have:\n- Paper vs Scissors: -1 points\n- Paper vs Rock: -3 points\n- Paper vs Paper: 0 points\n- Rock vs Scissors: -1 points\n- Rock vs Paper: 3 points\n- Rock vs Rock: 0 points\n- Scissors vs Rock: 1 points\n- Scissors vs Paper: 1 points\n- Scissors vs Scissors: 0 points\n\nRisk Analyst: In terms of risk-reward, Rock has the highest potential gain (3 points) but also the highest potential loss (-3 points). Scissors and Paper have more moderate outcomes (+1/-1 points). Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we should consider a balanced approach.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move with a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to analyze. However, in many games, players often start with Rock as it's psychologically perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I would recommend Scissors as our first move. Here's why:\n1. If opponent plays Rock (common opening), we get +1 point\n2. If opponent plays Paper, we get +1 point\n3. If opponent plays Scissors, we get 0 points (tie)\nThis gives us positive or neutral outcomes in all scenarios.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with this assessment. Scissors provides the most balanced risk-reward profile for an opening move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Since this is the first move, choosing scissors provides a balanced approach with potential for positive outcomes against both rock and paper, while risking only a small penalty.\n"

Our opponent played Paper in the first round, which wasn't the most common opening move. This might tell us something about their strategy. They might be:\n1. An experienced player who avoids obvious moves\n2. Using some form of random strategy\n3. Having a specific pattern starting with Paper\n\nGame Strategist: Our scissors move was logically sound, but it didn't work out. The opponent might be:\n- Expecting us to play scissors again (psychology of sticking to previous moves)\n- Switching to a different move (to avoid being predictable)\n- Following a pre-planned sequence\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that we lost -1 points, we're not in a terrible position. We could:\n1. Play Rock - Highest risk-reward (+3/-3)\n2. Play Paper - Medium risk (-1/-3)\n3. Play Scissors - Medium risk (+1/-1)\n\nGame Strategist: Since the opponent played Paper first, they might expect us to play Rock now (as a counter to their Paper). If they're thinking this way, they might play Scissors to counter our expected Rock. Therefore, I suggest we play Paper.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. Paper would:\n- Beat their Scissors if they try to counter our expected Rock\n- Tie if they stick with Paper\n- Only lose moderately (-3) if they play Rock\n\nRisk Analyst: The paper play makes sense. While it has the potential for the biggest loss (-3 against Rock), it protects against the most likely scenario based on our analysis (opponent playing Scissors).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Our opponent's first move suggests they might expect us to play Rock now, so they might switch to Scissors.

Paper \u2192 Rock could suggest a clockwise rotation in the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle.\n\nGame Strategist: If they're following a clockwise rotation (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors), they would play Scissors next. However, they might also:\n1. Be playing completely randomly\n2. Be adapting to our moves\n3. Have noticed we're losing and might stick with Rock since it gave them a bigger win\n\nRisk Analyst: We're down -4 points total now. We need to be more careful. Looking at our opponent's moves:\n- They've shown they're willing to use high-risk moves (Rock)\n- They've beaten us with both aggressive (Rock) and defensive (Paper) plays\n- They might be trying to establish psychological dominance with the -3 point win\n\nGame Strategist: Given that pattern recognition suggests Scissors but they might stick with Rock after such a successful move, we need to make a careful choice. I suggest we play Rock here because:\n1. It counters Scissors if they're following the clockwise pattern\n2. It ties with Rock if they stick to their winning move\n3. Only loses -3 to Paper, which they've only used once so far\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. The clockwise pattern suggests Scissors, and even if they don't follow this pattern, Rock gives us the best expected value against their likely moves.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock also gives us the potential for our biggest possible gain (+3), which we need to make up for our losses. The risk is acceptable given our current position.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on pattern analysis suggesting they might play Scissors next, and the possibility they might repeat their successful Rock move, Rock gives us the best combination of defense and potential high reward.\n"
