In the first attempt, they sent a move with an explanation, but there was an error in the format. The hint mentioned that the move message should start with [move], followed by an optional explanation in parentheses, and then the move. The user's initial response included the [move] tag correctly, but maybe the explanation was too long or had some formatting issues.\n\nNow, the user needs to correct their previous message. The key points from the hint are: the move message must start with [move], the explanation is optional and in parentheses, and the move must be one of rock, paper, or scissors. Also, they shouldn't mention that they're correcting a previous message. \n\nThe user's first move was choosing paper because they thought a new player might start with rock. That's a common strategy. But they need to format it correctly. The assistant's response should just be the corrected move message without any extra text. So, the correct format would be [move] (Anticipating a common first move of rock from a new player. Paper beats rock) Paper. Wait, but the example in the hint shows the move after the parentheses. Let me check the format again. The user's original message had \"[move] Anticipating... Paper beats rock. Paper\". The correction requires the move to be at the end, after the parentheses. So it should be [move] (Explanation here) Move. The user's original had the explanation and then the move, but maybe the period after \"rock\" was an issue. Also, the move should be lowercase? The example uses lowercase. Let me make sure. The valid moves are 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' in lowercase. So the corrected message should be [move] (Anticipating a common first move of rock from a new player. Paper beats rock) paper. That way, the explanation is in parentheses, followed by the move in lowercase. No extra text, just the move message. Alright, that should fix the formatting error.\n",

Hmm, maybe my initial assumption was wrong. Let me think about how to adjust my strategy.\n\nNew players often start with rock, but maybe this one didn't. Or maybe they thought I would expect rock and went for scissors to counter paper. Since scissors beat paper, they got me there. Now, I need to figure out what they might do next. \n\nIf they won with scissors last time, they might stick with the same move, thinking it's working. Alternatively, they might switch, expecting me to counter scissors with rock. Let me consider possible patterns. \n\nRock-Paper-Scissors is all about predicting the opponent's next move. If they used scissors and won, maybe they'll try scissors again. To counter that, I should play rock. But wait, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go back to paper. That's a possibility too. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock and choose paper to beat my rock. In that case, I should play scissors to beat their paper. But this is getting a bit too convoluted. Maybe I should look for a pattern or a common tendency. \n\nAnother approach: since they just won with scissors, they might feel confident and stick with it. So playing rock would beat their scissors. But if they expect that, they might switch to paper. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating moves. First scissors, then maybe rock? If they go to rock, I should play paper again. But that's risky. \n\nWait, maybe I should use a mixed strategy. Since they beat me with scissors, perhaps they're more likely to repeat it. So rock would be the safe choice. But I need to balance between predicting their move and not being too predictable myself. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter-strategy. Since I played paper first, they might expect me to switch to scissors next (to beat their possible paper). But they just used scissors, so if I play scissors, it would tie. Not helpful. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to randomize my moves to avoid being predictable. But since I'm supposed to maximize points, I need to find a pattern or exploit their tendencies. \n\nGiven that they just used scissors, perhaps they'll switch to rock (thinking I'll play rock to counter scissors). If they switch to rock, then I should play paper. But if they stay with scissors, I should play rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors again, thinking I'll switch to something else. If I play rock, I win. If they switch, I lose. \n\nI need to make a decision. Let's go with rock this time to counter their possible scissors again. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if I play scissors, I can beat their paper if they switch. \n\nWait, if they think I'll expect them to repeat scissors, they might switch to rock. So paper would beat rock. But if they think I'll play paper, they might stay with scissors. \n\nThis is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the best bet is to play rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. Let's try that.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what move to make next. The opponent has beaten me twice now. Let me recap the previous rounds.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, expecting them to pick rock as a new player. But they went with scissors, so I lost. Then, in the second round, I thought they might stick with scissors since it worked before, so I chose rock. But they switched to paper, and I lost again. Hmm.\n\nSo their moves so far are scissors and then paper. Maybe they're trying to anticipate my reactions. Let's think about patterns. After winning with scissors, they might expect me to counter with rock. So they switched to paper to beat that. Now, if I follow the same logic, after they won with paper, they might think I'll choose scissors to beat paper. So they could go for rock to counter scissors. If that's the case, I should choose paper again to beat their expected rock. Wait, but maybe they think I'll cycle through the moves. Let me map this out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to the move that beats what they previously used. First, scissors (beats paper), then paper (beats rock). Following that pattern, next they might choose rock (beats scissors). If that's the case, I should pick paper to beat rock. But I need to be careful here. Another possibility is that they're alternating moves. Scissors, then paper, maybe next scissors again? But that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, since they've won twice, they might stick with the same strategy. If they used paper last time, maybe they'll use it again. But I just lost to paper with rock, so if they repeat paper, I should choose scissors. Wait, but if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might go for rock. This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to model their possible thought process.\n\nThey beat my paper with scissors, then beat my rock with paper. So each time, they chose the move that would beat my previous move. If they're predicting my next move based on my previous choices, they might expect me to choose scissors next (since I went paper, then rock). If they think I'll pick scissors, they might choose rock. So to counter that, I should pick paper. But wait, that's similar to my first move. Alternatively, if they think I'm cycling through the moves (paper, rock, scissors), they might expect scissors next and choose rock. So again, paper would beat rock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter to my last move. My last move was rock, which loses to paper. If they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might choose scissors to beat paper. In that case, I should pick rock again. But that's risky because they might expect me to stay with rock and choose paper again. Hmm.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their moves. They went scissors, then paper. If they're following a pattern of moving backwards (scissors -> paper -> rock), then next would be rock. So I should pick paper. But if they're going in the opposite direction (paper -> scissors next?), but that doesn't fit. Wait, the order is rock, paper, scissors. So moving forward, scissors is after paper. But their moves were scissors then paper, which is moving backward. So maybe next is rock. So paper would beat rock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're choosing randomly. But since they're a new player, maybe they have a tendency to stick with what worked last. They won with paper last time, so maybe they'll use paper again. If that's the case, I should choose scissors. But they might anticipate that and switch to rock. Hmm.\n\nWait, the opponent is a new player. New players often start with rock, but after that, they might switch based on what they think works. Since they won with scissors and then paper, maybe they're trying to counter what they think I'll do. Let's see: first, they beat my paper with scissors. Then I chose rock, expecting their scissors, but they chose paper. So they anticipated that I would switch to rock after losing with paper. Now, after I chose rock and lost, maybe they think I'll switch to paper. So they might choose scissors to beat paper. If that's the case, I should choose rock to beat scissors. But wait, that's what I did in the second round, and they chose paper. So maybe they expect me to cycle again. Alternatively, if I choose scissors, which beats paper, but they might choose rock. This is getting too convoluted.\n\nPerhaps I should use a different strategy. Maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat approach, choosing the move that beats my last move. My last move was rock, so they chose paper. If I choose scissors next, they might choose rock. Then I can choose paper. But this is a cycle. Alternatively, if I choose paper now, they might expect me to repeat my first move (paper) and choose scissors again. But that's what they did in the first round. So maybe I should choose rock again, but they might expect that and choose paper again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to break the cycle. Since they've beaten me twice by predicting my moves, maybe I need to be less predictable. Let's try choosing scissors. If they expect me to go paper (to beat their previous paper), they might choose scissors, which I can beat with rock. Wait, no. If they choose scissors, I need paper. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf I choose scissors now, here's what could happen:\n\n- If they choose rock, I lose.\n- If they choose paper, I win.\n- If they choose scissors, it's a tie.\n\nBut based on their previous moves (scissors, paper), maybe they'll choose rock next. So scissors would lose. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, scissors would win. But they might switch to rock expecting me to choose scissors. This is a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose paper again, they might think I'm reverting to my first move and choose scissors again, which would beat me. But if they think I'll switch to paper after losing with rock, they might choose scissors. So paper would lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper. First scissors, then paper, next scissors again. If that's the case, I should choose rock to beat scissors. But if they continue the pattern, paper after scissors, then scissors again, but they already did scissors then paper. Maybe not.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should consider that the opponent is a new player and might not have a clear strategy yet. They might be choosing randomly or based on simple patterns. Since they won the last two rounds by choosing scissors and then paper, maybe they'll try to continue the pattern of choosing the move that beats my previous move. My last move was rock, so they chose paper. If I choose scissors now, they might expect me to go back to paper (since I started with paper) and choose scissors again. Or maybe they'll think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper, so they'll choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they choose the move that would have beaten their own last move. For example, they last chose paper. The move that beats paper is scissors, so maybe they'll choose scissors next. If that's the case, I should choose rock to beat scissors. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're just choosing randomly. In that case, there's no pattern, and I should just pick randomly. But since I'm trying to maximize points, maybe I should look for a balance. However, given that they've beaten me twice, perhaps they're following a pattern I haven't figured out yet.\n\nWait, let's list their moves and my moves:\n\nRound 1:\nMe: paper\nThem: scissors\nResult: I lost\n\nRound 2:\nMe: rock\nThem: paper\nResult: I lost\n\nSo their moves are scissors, then paper. If I look at the sequence, they went from scissors to paper. In the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle, scissors is beaten by rock, which is beaten by paper, which is beaten by scissors. So their first move was scissors, which lost to my paper. Wait, no: in the first round, I chose paper, they chose scissors, so scissors beats paper, so they won. Then in the second round, I chose rock, they chose paper, so paper beats rock, they won again.\n\nSo their moves are scissors, paper. If they follow the pattern of moving one step forward in the cycle (scissors -> paper -> rock), then next would be rock. So I should choose paper to beat rock. Alternatively, if they move backward (scissors -> paper -> scissors), then next would be scissors. Then I should choose rock. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're choosing the move that beats their previous move. Their first move was scissors. The move that beats scissors is rock. Then their next move was paper, which beats rock. If they follow this pattern, the next move would be scissors, which beats paper. So scissors. Then I should choose rock. But this is a possible pattern.\n\nAlternatively, they might be choosing the move that I previously chose. I chose paper, then rock. So they might expect me to choose scissors next (following the cycle). If they expect scissors, they'll choose rock. So I should choose paper to beat rock. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven all these possibilities, I need to make a decision. Let's consider the most likely scenarios:\n\n1. They expect me to choose scissors (since I went paper, rock, maybe next scissors). So they choose rock. I should choose paper.\n2. They follow their own pattern of scissors, paper, next scissors. I choose rock.\n3. They repeat their last move (paper), so I choose scissors.\n4. They choose the move that beats their last move (paper is beaten by scissors), so they choose scissors. I choose rock.\n\nWhich of these is more likely? Since they're a new player, maybe they're not following complex patterns. After winning with paper, they might stick with it, thinking it's lucky. So they might choose paper again. In that case, I should choose scissors. But if they think I'll counter paper with scissors, they might switch to rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper, so they choose rock. Then I should choose paper. But this is getting into second-guessing.\n\nAnother angle: in the first two rounds, they chose the move that beats my previous move. I chose paper, they chose scissors. I chose rock, they chose paper. If they continue this pattern, they'll choose the move that beats my last move (rock), which is paper. So they'll choose paper again. To counter that, I should choose scissors. But if they do choose paper, scissors would win. However, if they break the pattern and choose something else, like rock or scissors, I might lose.\n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll expect them to choose paper again and I'll choose scissors, they might choose rock. So I should choose paper to beat rock. But this is third-level thinking.\n\nGiven that they've beaten me twice by countering my previous move, maybe they'll continue that strategy. So my last move was rock, they chose paper. If I now choose scissors, they might expect me to choose scissors (following the cycle) and choose rock. So I should choose paper. But this is getting too deep.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to break the cycle by choosing the same move again. If I chose rock last time and lost, maybe they expect me to switch. So if I choose rock again, they might choose paper again, and I lose. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose scissors, which they haven't seen me use yet, maybe they won't expect it. If they choose paper again, scissors wins. If they choose rock, I lose. If they choose scissors, it's a tie.\n\nConsidering all this, perhaps the safest bet is to choose scissors. If they stick with paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they choose scissors, tie. But given their previous moves, they might expect me to choose scissors and counter with rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten me twice by choosing the move that beats my previous one, they might expect me to choose scissors next. So they'll choose rock. Therefore, I should choose paper. That way, if they choose rock, I win. If they choose paper, tie. If they choose scissors, I lose. But given their pattern, they might choose rock.\n\nThis is a tough call. I think the most logical move based on their pattern of countering my previous move is to choose scissors, expecting them to choose paper again. Wait, no. If they counter my previous move (rock), they would choose paper. So if I choose scissors, which beats paper, I would win. But if they instead choose rock, I lose. But if they follow the same pattern, they should choose paper again. So scissors would be a good choice.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- My last move was rock. They countered with paper.\n- If I now choose scissors, which beats paper, and they choose paper again, I win.\n- If they instead choose rock (anticipating me to choose scissors), I lose.\n- If they choose scissors, it's a tie.\n\nBut why would they choose paper again? Because they might think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper. But if they think that, they might choose rock to beat my scissors. So this is a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose paper, which beats rock, and they choose rock, I win. If they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose paper, tie.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the best approach is to choose scissors, hoping they stick with paper. But given that they've been countering my previous moves, they might expect me to choose scissors and pick rock. So maybe I should choose paper to beat their expected rock. But this is a higher-level strategy.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been successful with countering my moves, they might continue that. So they'll choose the move that beats my last move (rock), which is paper. So I should choose scissors to beat their expected paper. That seems logical. Let's go with that.\n",

Instead, they chose scissors. So maybe the pattern isn't consistent. Maybe they thought I would repeat scissors, so they chose scissors again. Or maybe they're trying to vary their strategy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a tit-for-tat approach, mirroring my previous move. Let's see:\n\nMy previous move was scissors (third round), so if they mirror, they would play scissors again. But in the third round, they did play scissors. If that's the case, next they might play whatever I played last. My last move was scissors, so they might play scissors again. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they're mirroring, they might play scissors again. Alternatively, if they expect me to play rock to beat their scissors, they might switch to paper. \n\nThis is tricky.

Maybe they're more likely to play scissors again. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they think I'll play rock, they might play paper. Alternatively, if they're sticking with scissors, rock is safe. \n\nAlternatively, since they tied last time with scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock to try to beat scissors. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they switch to rock, and I play paper, I win. If they stay with scissors, I lose. \n\nThis is a lot of uncertainty. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern. Their moves: scissors, paper, scissors. If there's a cycle, maybe next is paper again? Or maybe they alternate between scissors and paper. Scissors, paper, scissors, paper... If that's the case, next would be paper. Then I should play scissors to beat paper. But in the third round, they chose scissors again, breaking the alternation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're choosing the move that would have beaten my previous move. Let's see:\n\nAfter I played scissors (third round), the move that beats scissors is rock. So if they follow that pattern, they might play rock next.

Alternatively, if they think I'll play scissors again (since I did last time), they might play rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nWait, but in the third round, they chose scissors when I chose scissors. So maybe they're not always countering. Maybe they're trying to mirror my move. If that's the case, next they might play whatever I played last. My last move was scissors, so they play scissors. Then I should play rock. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to decide. Maybe the best approach is to choose the move that beats their most frequent choice. They've chosen scissors twice and paper once.

If I play scissors, I lose to rock but beat paper. If they play paper, scissors would win. If they play rock, scissors lose. \n\nThis is really a game of psychology. Without more data, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best move is to go with paper, expecting them to play rock (anticipating my rock).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been changing their moves based on previous rounds. Let me recap the history to spot a pattern.\n\nFirst round: I played paper, they played scissors. I lost. So they started with scissors, which beat my paper. Then next round, I thought they might repeat scissors, so I chose rock. But they played paper, which beat my rock. Another loss. Then I tried scissors, expecting them to stick with paper, but they also chose scissors, leading to a tie. After that, I guessed they might switch to rock, so I played paper and won. \n\nNow, after winning with paper against their rock, what would they do next? They might think I'll stick with paper again, so they could switch to scissors to beat it. Alternatively, they might expect me to change and play something else. Let's think about their possible patterns. \n\nThey started with scissors, then paper, then scissors again, then rock. Wait, no, let me check again. Wait, the moves were:\n\nRound 1: Opponent scissors (I played paper)\nRound 2: Opponent paper (I played rock)\nRound 3: Opponent scissors (I played scissors, tie)\nRound 4: Opponent rock (I played paper, won)\n\nSo their moves: scissors, paper, scissors, rock. Hmm, not a clear cycle. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Let's see:\n\nAfter I played paper (R1), they played scissors. Then I played rock (R2), they played paper. Then I played scissors (R3), they played scissors. Then I played paper (R4), they played rock. So their move in each round seems to be countering my previous move. For example:\n\nR1: I played paper, they countered with scissors.\nR2: I played rock, they countered with paper.\nR3: I played scissors, they played scissors (maybe expecting me to stick with scissors again, but it was a tie).\nR4: I played paper, they countered with rock.\n\nWait, but in R3, when I played scissors, they also played scissors. Maybe they thought I would repeat scissors, so they played the same. But after that, when I played paper (R4), they went back to rock. \n\nSo maybe their strategy is to counter my previous move. If that's the case, then after I played paper in R4 and they played rock (which lost), they might expect me to play paper again, so they might switch to scissors next. Therefore, to counter that, I should play rock. Because if they choose scissors, rock beats scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch from paper to something else. If I just won with paper, maybe they think I'll stick with it, so they go scissors. But if I switch to rock, I can beat their scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Their moves were scissors, paper, scissors, rock. Not a clear cycle. Maybe they're trying to predict my moves based on my previous choices. Let's see my moves: paper, rock, scissors, paper. So my moves are cycling through paper, rock, scissors, paper. If they notice that, they might expect me to go rock next (continuing the cycle). But I just played paper, so next in the cycle would be rock. If they think that, they might play paper to beat my rock. So I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think about common patterns. After a loss, players often switch their move. The opponent lost the last round (R4) when they played rock against my paper. So they might switch from rock to paper or scissors. If they switch to paper, then I should play scissors. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might think that since I won with paper, I might repeat it, so they'll choose scissors. So I should choose rock to beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might try to counter my previous move. My last move was paper, so they might choose scissors. So I should choose rock. \n\nHmm. There's a few possibilities here. The key is to predict their next move based on their previous behavior. Since they've been countering my previous moves, perhaps they'll continue that pattern. So if I last played paper, they'll play scissors. Therefore, I should play rock. \n\nBut wait, in R3, when I played scissors, they also played scissors. That might indicate that when I play scissors, they play the same. But in R4, when I played paper, they played rock, which is the move that paper beats. So maybe they're not always countering, but sometimes playing the move that would have lost to my previous move. Wait, that's confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten their own last move. For example, after playing rock (R4), they might play paper next, because paper beats rock. But that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a simple rotation. Their moves were scissors, paper, scissors, rock. Maybe next they'll play paper again? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, considering that they lost the last round when they played rock, they might switch to paper (to beat rock) or scissors (to beat paper). If they think I'll repeat paper, they might choose scissors. So I should choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch from paper to something else, maybe they'll choose rock again, expecting me to play scissors. But that's less likely. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, the safest bet might be to assume they'll counter my last move (paper) with scissors, so I play rock. Alternatively, if they think I'm going to repeat paper, they play scissors, so I play rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between their own moves. Their moves: scissors, paper, scissors, rock. The pattern isn't clear. Scissors, then paper (which loses to scissors), then scissors again, then rock (which loses to paper). It's possible they're not following a strict pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a \"defeat last move\" strategy. So whatever I played last, they play the move that beats it. Since I played paper last, they'll play scissors. Therefore, I should play rock. \n\nYes, that seems plausible. If they're using a strategy to beat my last move, then after I played paper, they'll choose scissors. So I should choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they're trying to vary their moves to avoid being predictable, maybe they'll switch to something else. But given that they've been countering my previous moves, I think the best guess is scissors, so rock is the move.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what move to make next. The opponent's pattern so far has been a bit unpredictable. Let me recap the previous rounds to spot any trends.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, expecting their rock, but they picked scissors. I lost. Then I switched to rock, thinking they might repeat scissors, but they went with paper. Another loss. Next, I tried scissors, predicting their paper, but it was a tie with both scissors. Then I went back to paper, which worked against their rock. Finally, I chose rock again, which beat their scissors. \n\nSo their moves were: scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors. Hmm. They alternated between scissors and paper, then rock and scissors. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous moves. After I won with paper, they switched to scissors, which I then countered with rock. Now that I won with rock, maybe they'll expect me to stick with it and choose paper. If that's the case, I should go with scissors to beat their expected paper. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch from rock to paper, so they might pick scissors again. But if they pick scissors, I should choose rock. Wait, but I just won with rock, so they might anticipate that and go paper. This is a bit tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of switching between their previous moves. Let's see: scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors. The last two moves were rock and scissors. If they follow a pattern, maybe they'll go back to paper? Or maybe they're cycling through moves. Scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors... Not sure. \n\nAnother angle: after a win, they might stick with the same move. They won the first two rounds with scissors and paper. Then after a tie with scissors, they lost with rock, then lost again with scissors. So after losing, they changed from rock to scissors. Maybe they're reacting to their own losses by switching. If they lost with scissors last time, they might switch to rock or paper. But I just beat their scissors with rock. If they think I'll stay with rock, they might go paper. So I should counter with scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might go scissors. Then I should choose rock again. \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should use a strategy that's less about predicting their exact move and more about balancing my choices. But given the history, the last two times I won were with paper and rock. They might expect me to switch to scissors now. If they think that, they might play rock to beat my scissors. So I should stick with rock to beat their possible scissors again. Wait, but they just lost with scissors, so maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they've used scissors three times, paper once, and rock once, maybe they favor scissors. If that's the case, rock would be a safe choice. But they might be aware of that and switch. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should go with paper. If they think I'll stick with rock, they might choose paper, so I can beat that with scissors. Wait, no. If they choose paper, I need scissors to beat it. But if I choose scissors and they choose rock, I lose. \n\nWait, the last time I won with rock against their scissors. If they think I'll repeat rock, they might go paper. So I should choose scissors to beat their paper. But if they instead stick with scissors, then scissors ties with scissors. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, then paper would beat it. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list their moves again:\n\nRound 1: scissors (they won)\nRound 2: paper (they won)\nRound 3: scissors (tie)\nRound 4: rock (they lost)\nRound 5: scissors (they lost)\n\nSo after two wins, they tied, then lost twice. Their moves are S, P, S, R, S. It's possible they're cycling through S, P, S, R, S, but it's not clear. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my previous moves. Let's see my moves and theirs:\n\nMy moves: P, R, S, P, R\nTheir moves: S, P, S, R, S\n\nSo when I played P, they played S (beat me)\nWhen I played R, they played P (beat me)\nWhen I played S, they played S (tie)\nWhen I played P, they played R (I won)\nWhen I played R, they played S (I won)\n\nSo their move seems to sometimes counter my previous move. For example, after I played P, they played S. After I played R, they played P. After I played S, they played S. Then after I played P again, they played R. Then after I played R again, they played S. So maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. If that's the case, then after my last move was R, they might play P to counter. So I should play S to beat their P. \n\nAlternatively, if they notice that I tend to counter their previous move, they might switch. For example, after I beat their R with P, then their S with R, maybe they expect me to counter their S with R again, so they might play P to beat my R. But in the last round, I played R and they played S, which I beat. So if they think I'll play R again, they might play P. Therefore, I should play S to beat their P. \n\nAlternatively, if they lost twice in a row, they might switch strategies. Maybe they'll go back to a move that previously worked. They won the first two rounds with S and P. Maybe they'll try S again. If they play S, I should play R. \n\nBut this is all speculative. Given the uncertainty, maybe the best move is to play paper. If they expect me to play R again, they might play P, so I can play S. But if they play S, then I lose. Alternatively, if I play paper, and they play S, I lose. If they play R, I win. If they play P, it's a tie. \n\nWait, the last time they played S and lost. If they switch from S, they might play R or P. If they play R, I should play P. If they play P, I should play S. If they play S again, I should play R. \n\nBut how to decide? Maybe based on the most recent loss. They lost with S, so they might switch. If they switch from S, possible moves are R or P. If they choose R, I should play P. If they choose P, I should play S. \n\nAlternatively, they might think that since I've played R twice in a row (last two moves: R, R), I might switch to S or P. If they think I'll switch to S, they might play R. If they think I'll switch to P, they might play S. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe a better approach is to use a mixed strategy, but since this is a deterministic opponent (though their pattern isn't clear), perhaps the best bet is to assume they'll try to counter my previous move. Since my last move was R, they might play P. So I should play S. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll repeat R, they play P, so I play S. If they think I'll switch from R to S, they play R, so I should play P. But without knowing their strategy, it's hard. \n\nGiven the previous pattern where they countered my R with P, then my S with S, then my P with R, then my R with S, maybe they are countering my previous move. So after my R, they might play P again. So I should play S. \n\nBut in the last round, when I played R, they played S, which I beat. So maybe they tried to counter my R with S, but that didn't work. So perhaps they'll try a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are cycling through their own moves. Their moves were S, P, S, R, S. If they continue the pattern, next could be P? S, P, S, R, S, P? But that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to avoid repeating the same move after a loss. They lost with R and S, so maybe they'll switch to P. \n\nI think the safest bet is to assume they'll try to counter my previous move (R) with P, so I should play S. But given that last time they countered R with S (which lost), maybe they'll try a different counter. \n\nAlternatively, they might notice that when they played S against my R, they lost, so they might avoid S and try P. \n\nIn any case, I'll go with scissors to beat their potential paper.\n",

Lost again. Then I tried scissors, which tied. Next, I played paper against their rock and won. Then rock against their scissors, won. Then scissors, but they played rock, so I lost again.\n\nHmm, the opponent seems to be countering my previous move. When I played paper, they went scissors. When I played rock, they went paper. When I played scissors, they went rock. It looks like they're predicting my move and choosing the one that beats it. So after I played scissors and lost, they might expect me to switch to rock. If that's the case, they might play paper to counter rock. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. Wait, but last time I played scissors, they played rock. Maybe they think I'll switch back to rock again. Let me think. If I just lost with scissors, they might think I'll go back to rock, so they might play paper. If I play scissors again, scissors beats paper. But wait, they might also think I'm trying to counter their expected paper. This is getting a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Let's see their moves: scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock. Not a clear cycle. Maybe they're using a pattern based on my previous moves. Let me try to anticipate their next move based on my last move. Last round I played scissors, which lost to their rock. If they think I'll switch to rock to beat scissors, they might play paper. So if I play scissors again, I can beat their paper. But I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe they'll stick with rock again, thinking I might play scissors again. Wait, if they played rock last time and won, maybe they'll repeat it. If I play paper, paper beats rock. But that's assuming they repeat. But they might not. This is a bit of a guessing game. Alternatively, maybe they're alternating between rock and paper. Let me check their moves again: scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock. The last two moves were rock. Wait, no, the last two were scissors (tie), then rock (they played rock when I played scissors). Wait, the last round they played rock. So in the last round, I played scissors, they played rock. So if they played rock last time, maybe they'll switch to paper next, expecting me to play rock to counter their rock. If I play scissors, scissors would beat paper. But if they think I'm going to play rock, they'll play paper. So scissors beats paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll play paper to beat their previous rock, they might play scissors. Then I should play rock. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a pattern in their responses. Let's list all the rounds:\n\n1. Me: paper \u2192 Opponent: scissors (I lost)\n2. Me: rock \u2192 Opponent: paper (I lost)\n3. Me: scissors \u2192 Opponent: scissors (tie)\n4. Me: paper \u2192 Opponent: rock (I won)\n5. Me: rock \u2192 Opponent: scissors (I won)\n6. Me: scissors \u2192 Opponent: rock (I lost)\n\nLooking at their moves: scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock. It seems like after a win, they stick with the same move. For example, when they won with scissors (round 1), next they played paper (round 2). Wait, that's a change. Hmm. Maybe not. Alternatively, after a loss, they switch. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: they won with scissors. Next round, they played paper (which lost to my rock). Then in round 3, they played scissors again (tie). Then in round 4, they played rock (lost to my paper). Then in round 5, they played scissors (lost to my rock). Then in round 6, they played rock (beat my scissors). So after a loss, they sometimes switch. It's not a clear pattern. Maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors. When I played rock, they played paper. When I played scissors, they played scissors (tie). Then when I played paper again, they played rock. When I played rock again, they played scissors. When I played scissors again, they played rock. So it seems like they are choosing the move that beats my previous move. Let's check:\n\nMy previous move \u2192 their move:\n\nPaper \u2192 scissors (beats paper)\nRock \u2192 paper (beats rock)\nScissors \u2192 scissors (tie)\nPaper \u2192 rock (beats paper)\nRock \u2192 scissors (beats rock)\nScissors \u2192 rock (beats scissors)\n\nWait, in round 3, I played scissors and they played scissors. That's a tie. Then in round 4, I played paper, they played rock (which loses to paper). Wait, that's not countering. Hmm. Maybe they are not consistently countering. Let me see:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, they countered with scissors (correct counter)\nRound 2: I played rock, they countered with paper (correct counter)\nRound 3: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie, not countering)\nRound 4: I played paper, they played rock (which loses to paper, so not countering)\nRound 5: I played rock, they played scissors (correct counter)\nRound 6: I played scissors, they played rock (correct counter)\n\nSo sometimes they counter correctly, sometimes not. Maybe they are a mix of countering and random. Alternatively, after a tie, they changed strategy. Let's see. After the tie in round 3, in round 4 I played paper, and they played rock, which is not a counter. Then in round 5, I played rock, they countered with scissors. Then in round 6, I played scissors, they countered with rock. So maybe in the last few rounds, they started countering correctly. If that's the case, then they are now consistently countering my previous move. So if in the last round I played scissors, they countered with rock. Now, if I play paper, they might counter with scissors. Wait, but how does that work? If they are countering my previous move, then whatever I played last, they play the counter. So if last I played scissors, they play rock. If I now play paper, they would play scissors (to counter paper). But if they are countering based on my previous move, then my next move should be the one that beats their expected counter. For example, if I played scissors last, they expect me to play something else, but if they are countering based on my last move, they would play rock again. Wait, maybe they are using a strategy where they play the move that beats my previous move. So if I last played scissors, they play rock. If I now play paper, they would play scissors (to beat paper). But if I play rock, they would play paper. So to counter their expected move, I need to play the move that beats their expected counter. Let's model this:\n\nIf they are countering my last move:\n\nMy last move \u2192 their next move\n\nscissors \u2192 rock\n\nSo if I last played scissors, they will play rock. To beat rock, I should play paper. But in the last round, I played scissors, they played rock. So if they are following this pattern, they will play rock again. Wait, no. If they are countering my last move, then each time, they play the move that beats my last move. So if I last played scissors, they play rock. If I then play paper, they would play scissors (to beat paper). But if I play paper now, expecting them to play rock again, but they might instead play scissors. Hmm. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe they are using a different strategy. Let's think: in the last three rounds, when I played paper, they played rock (which loses to paper), then when I played rock, they played scissors (loses to rock), then when I played scissors, they played rock (beats scissors). Wait, that's inconsistent. Wait, no: when I played paper (round 4), they played rock (which loses to paper). Then I played rock (round 5), they played scissors (loses to rock). Then I played scissors (round 6), they played rock (beats scissors). So in rounds 4-6, their moves were rock, scissors, rock. So they alternated between rock and scissors. Maybe they have a pattern of rock, scissors, rock, scissors... But that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe they are reacting to my previous two moves. It's hard to tell. Given the uncertainty, perhaps I should try to find a move that can either win or tie based on their possible next moves. Let's consider possible options:\n\nIf they play rock again: I should play paper.\n\nIf they play paper: I should play scissors.\n\nIf they play scissors: I should play rock.\n\nBut how to predict their move? Based on previous patterns, they might be countering my last move. So if I last played scissors, they play rock. If I now play paper, which beats rock, I would win. But if they think I'm going to counter their rock with paper, they might play scissors to beat paper. So in that case, I should play rock to beat scissors. But this is getting into second-level thinking. Alternatively, maybe they are sticking with the same move if it worked. They played rock last time and won, so they might play rock again. If that's the case, I should play paper. But if they switch to paper expecting me to play paper, then I should play scissors. This is a common problem in rock-paper-scissors strategies. Without a clear pattern, it's challenging. Maybe the best approach is to vary my moves based on their possible counters. Since they countered my last move (scissors) with rock, maybe they'll continue to counter. So if I play paper, expecting them to play rock again, but they might switch to counter paper with scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper to beat their rock, they might play scissors. So I should play rock to beat scissors. But this is third-level thinking. Alternatively, maybe a random choice is better, but since the opponent might be predictable, I can try to detect a pattern. Let's try to see: after they win, do they stick with the same move? Let's check:\n\nRound 1: they won with scissors. Next move: paper (lost)\nRound 2: they won with paper. Next move: scissors (tie)\nRound 3: tie with scissors. Next move: rock (lost)\nRound 4: they lost with rock. Next move: scissors (lost)\nRound 5: they lost with scissors. Next move: rock (won)\nRound 6: they won with rock. Next move: ?\n\nSo after winning with rock in round 6, what will they do? If they stick with the same move, they'll play rock again. Then I should play paper. But if they switch, maybe to paper to counter a possible rock from me. Alternatively, they might play paper expecting me to play paper to beat their rock. This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the safest bet is to assume they'll counter my last move (scissors) with rock again. So I should play paper. But in the last round, they played rock, so if they repeat, paper wins. Alternatively, if they think I'll play paper to counter their rock, they might play scissors. So I should play rock to beat scissors. But this is a gamble. Alternatively, since they've been countering my last move, I can play the move that beats their counter. For example, if they counter my scissors with rock, I can play paper next. But if they expect that and play scissors, I lose. Hmm. Maybe I should use a different strategy, like playing the move that beats the move that would beat my last move. For example, last I played scissors, which was beaten by rock. The move that beats rock is paper. So play paper. But this is similar to the previous thought. Alternatively, since they've been countering, I can play the move that beats their expected counter. If they counter my last move (scissors) with rock, I play paper. If they counter that with scissors, I play rock next time. But this requires predicting their next counter. Given the previous pattern, maybe they are consistently countering my last move. So:\n\nMy last move: scissors \u2192 their next move: rock\n\nSo I should play paper to beat rock. But in round 4, when I played paper, they played rock, which I beat. Then in round 5, I played rock, they played scissors. Then in round 6, I played scissors, they played rock. So if this pattern holds, they are countering my last move. Therefore, if I last played scissors, they will play rock. So I should play paper. But wait, in round 4, I played paper, they played rock (countering my previous move, which was scissors in round 3). Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nRound 1: I played paper \u2192 they played scissors (countering paper)\nRound 2: I played rock \u2192 they played paper (countering rock)\nRound 3: I played scissors \u2192 they played scissors (tie, not countering)\nRound 4: I played paper \u2192 they played rock (countering paper)\nRound 5: I played rock \u2192 they played scissors (countering rock)\nRound 6: I played scissors \u2192 they played rock (countering scissors)\n\nSo except for round 3, they have been countering my previous move. Round 3 was a tie, maybe they tried to repeat. So assuming they are now consistently countering my previous move, then after I played scissors (round 6), they countered with rock. So next, they will counter my last move, which was scissors, with rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat rock. But if they are countering, then my current move (to be made now) is based on their expectation of my last move. Wait, no. Their move is based on my last move. So if I last played scissors, they will play rock. Therefore, I should play paper now. That makes sense. Let's go with that.\n",

Their moves: scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock. It seems they alternated between scissors and paper initially, then started using rock more.

If they're sticking with rock, then I should play paper. But in the last round, I played paper and they played rock, so if they keep doing that, paper is safe. But maybe they'll switch to scissors to counter my paper. Hmm. Alternatively, if they notice I've been using paper to beat their rock, they might switch to scissors. So I should play rock to beat scissors. But this is a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using rock the last two times, maybe they'll switch. But if they're a new player, they might not have a strong pattern. Maybe they're sticking with rock because it's a common choice. In that case, paper again would work. But I need to avoid being predictable. Maybe switch to scissors to catch them if they expect paper. But scissors loses to rock. Wait, if they play rock again, scissors would lose. So maybe paper is safer. \n\nAlternatively, since I just won with paper, they might expect me to repeat, so they'll play scissors. Then I should play rock. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. This is a classic rock-paper-scissors mind game. Without a clear pattern, maybe the best is to go with the move that beats their most frequent recent choice. They've played rock three times in the last four rounds. So maybe paper is still a good choice. But I need to consider that they might adjust. \n\nAlternatively, since I've used paper twice in a row (rounds 4 and 7), they might expect me to do it again and counter with scissors. So I should play rock. But if they stick with rock, rock ties. Wait, no: if I play rock and they play scissors, I win. If they play paper, I lose. If they play rock, it's a tie. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest bet is to alternate. Since I played paper last time, maybe switch to scissors. But if they play rock, I lose. Alternatively, play rock. But I'm not sure. Given the uncertainty, perhaps stick with paper again, expecting them to stay with rock. But if they do switch to scissors, I lose.

Let's see:\n\nMy moves: paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper.\n\nTheir responses: scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock.\n\nSo when I play paper, they played scissors (lost), then rock (won), then rock (won). Wait, when I played paper in round 1, they played scissors (I lost). Then in round 4, I played paper, they played rock (I won). Then in round 7, I played paper, they played rock again (I won). So when I play paper, they sometimes play scissors or rock. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are reacting to my previous move.

So if I played paper in round 7, they might play scissors in round 8. Therefore, I should play rock to beat scissors. \n\nBut this is speculative. Alternatively, since they've been countering my previous move, if my last move was paper, they might play scissors. So I should play rock. But if they think I'll do that, they might play paper. It's a loop. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using rock a lot recently, maybe they'll stick with it. So play paper again. But that's risky if they switch. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to vary my move. Since I played paper last time, maybe switch to rock. If they expect me to repeat paper, they'll play scissors, and I can beat that with rock. If they stick with rock, it's a tie.

But if they play rock, I lose. \n\nThis is a tough call. Maybe the safest move is to play paper again, hoping they stick with rock. But given that they lost twice in a row with rock, they might switch. So perhaps scissors to beat paper. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, use a random move. But since the opponent might be predictable, trying to find a pattern. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost the last two times with rock, they might switch to paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll play paper again, they might play scissors, so I play rock. \n\nHmm. Given the previous pattern, after I play paper, they sometimes play scissors or rock. If they played rock the last two times I played paper, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So rock would be good. \n\nBut I'm not certain. Maybe I should go with rock this time.\n",

Hmm, not a clear pattern. Maybe they're countering my last move. Let's see:\n\nAfter I won with paper (beating their rock), they might expect me to repeat paper, so they could go scissors. If I play rock now, I can beat their scissors. Wait, but last time I played rock, they countered with paper. So maybe they think I'll switch from rock to something else. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But they might anticipate that and switch to rock. This is tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their responses. Let's list the sequence again:\n\nMy moves: paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock\nTheir moves: scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper\n\nAfter my paper, they played scissors. Then after my rock, they played paper. After scissors, they played scissors (tie). Then after paper, they played rock. After rock, scissors. After scissors, rock. After paper, rock. After rock, paper.\n\nIt seems like they often play the move that beats my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors (which beats paper). When I played rock, they played paper (beats rock). When I played scissors, they played scissors (tie). Then when I played paper again, they played rock (loses to paper). Wait, that's inconsistent. Maybe they're not always countering. Let me check again:\n\n1. My move: paper \u2192 their scissors (counter)\n2. My move: rock \u2192 their paper (counter)\n3. My move: scissors \u2192 their scissors (same)\n4. My move: paper \u2192 their rock (loses, so not countering)\n5. My move: rock \u2192 their scissors (loses, so not countering)\n6. My move: scissors \u2192 their rock (counter)\n7. My move: paper \u2192 their rock (loses)\n8. My move: rock \u2192 their paper (counter)\n\nHmm, sometimes they counter, sometimes not. Maybe they alternate strategies. The last two times I played rock, they countered with paper. So maybe they expect me to play rock again and will counter with paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But wait, in the last round, I played rock and they played paper. If they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors. Then I should play rock again. But this is getting too convoluted. Maybe a better approach is to look for their most frequent move. Their moves: scissors (twice), paper (twice), rock (three times). They played rock more often. If they tend to play rock, I should play paper. But their last move was paper. If they stick to paper, I should play scissors. Alternatively, they might switch from paper to something else. Since they just won with paper, maybe they'll stick with it. Or they might think I'll counter their paper with scissors, so they switch to rock. This is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe I should use a mixed strategy. Alternatively, since they countered my last rock with paper, maybe they'll expect me to play scissors to beat their paper, so they'll play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat their expected rock. Wait, that's a chain of predictions. Let me try that. If I played rock last and they countered with paper, they might think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper. So they might play rock to beat my scissors. Therefore, I should play paper to beat their rock. That seems plausible. Let's go with paper.\n",

Before that, they used paper to beat my rock. So after I played rock and lost, I switched to paper expecting them to maybe stick with paper again, but they did the same. Now, what's next?\n\nHmm, maybe they think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper. If they expect that, they might play rock to counter scissors. But if I play paper again, maybe they'll stick with paper again, leading to another tie. Or maybe they'll switch to scissors, thinking I'll stay on paper. Wait, if I play scissors now, and they play paper, I win. But if they play rock, I lose. Alternatively, if I play rock and they play scissors, I win. But their recent moves: they've used paper, then paper again. So maybe they're sticking with paper. If that's the case, scissors would win. But they might anticipate that. Let me think. Since the last two times they played paper, maybe they'll switch. Or maybe they think I'll try to counter their paper with scissors, so they might switch to rock. If I play scissors, and they play rock, I lose. If I play paper again, and they play scissors, I lose. If I play rock, and they play scissors, I win. But their pattern isn't clear.

But if they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll play scissors, they play rock. So maybe I should play paper again. But that leads to a tie if they also play paper. Hmm. This is a bit of a guessing game. Maybe I should try to detect a pattern.

Not a clear pattern. Maybe they are trying to counter my previous moves. For example, when I played paper, they played paper. When I played scissors, they played rock. When I played rock, they played paper. So perhaps they are countering my last move. Let's see:\n\nMy previous move was paper. If they counter that, they would play scissors. So if I play rock, I beat scissors. But if they expect me to play rock, they might play paper again. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the safest bet is to play scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. But given that they've played paper twice in a row, maybe they'll switch. Alternatively, they might think I expect them to switch and thus play rock. This is getting into meta-levels. Maybe I should just go with a random choice, but since I need to maximize points, perhaps look for a pattern. Alternatively, use a strategy like \"play what beats their most frequent move\". Their most frequent move is paper (4 times: rounds 2,5,7,8). So scissors would beat paper. But if they keep playing paper, scissors is good. But they might switch. Alternatively, since they've played paper twice in a row, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock. But I can't know. Maybe the best is to play scissors, hoping they stay on paper. If they do, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, play rock, expecting them to play scissors.

Now Round 10, they just played scissors again.\n\nHmm, their pattern isn't very clear. They seem to switch between moves, sometimes repeating. But after a loss, they might switch.

After losing with scissors (Round 5), they played rock (Round 6). After winning with rock (Round 6), they played paper (Round 7). After a tie with paper (Round 7), they played scissors (Round 8). After losing with paper (Round 8), they played scissors (Round 9). Now, after winning with scissors (Round 9), what's next?\n\nIf they followed the previous pattern after a win with scissors (Round 1), they switched to paper. So maybe after Round 9's win with scissors, they'll switch to paper again. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat paper. But wait, they just won with scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. Alternatively, they might expect me to play rock to counter their scissors, so they play paper. But if I play scissors, I beat their paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll play scissors again (since I just lost with paper), they might play rock. So I need to predict their next move based on their possible reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a counter-strategy. For example, if I tend to play the move that would have beaten their last move. Let's see my previous responses:\n\nAfter they played scissors (Round 1), I played rock (Round 2). Then they played paper (Round 2), I played scissors (Round 3). Then they played scissors (Round 3), I played paper (Round 4). Then they played rock (Round 4), I played paper (Round 5).

Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, the user's latest message says:\n\n\"[hint] Move made. Waiting for the game to end.\n\nYou lost the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors.\nYou scored -1 points.\n\nLet's play another round. Please make your move.\"\n\nThen my response was scissors, which led to a tie.

Your opponent made the move: scissors.\nYou scored -1 points.\n\nLet's play another round. Please make your move.\"\n\nSo the opponent has just beaten my paper with scissors again. Now I need to choose the next move.\n\nSo the opponent's last move was scissors, which beat my paper. Now, what do they expect me to do? If I lost with paper, maybe I'll switch to scissors to beat their scissors (but that would tie) or rock to beat their scissors. If they think I'll play rock, they might play paper to counter. So if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll play scissors again, they might play rock. But they just won with scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. Or they might switch to paper expecting my rock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are following a pattern of repeating their winning move. They won with scissors, so they might play scissors again. If that's the case, I should play rock. But in the past, after winning with scissors, they sometimes switched to paper. For example, in Round 1, they won with scissors, then in Round 2 they played paper. So maybe they switch to beat the expected counter. So if I play rock to beat their scissors, they play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they actually repeat scissors, then I should play rock. It's a bit of a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they alternate after a win. If they won with scissors, next they play paper. Then if they win with paper, next they play scissors, etc. But I need to see their pattern. Let's check their moves after a win:\n\nAfter Round 1 (win with scissors), they played paper (Round 2).\nAfter Round 2 (win with paper), they played scissors (Round 3).\nAfter Round 6 (win with rock), they played paper (Round 7).\nAfter Round 9 (win with scissors), they played scissors again (Round 10? Wait, no, the latest move was them playing scissors again in the last round where I lost with paper. So after winning with scissors in Round 9, they played scissors again in Round 10, which resulted in a tie. Wait, no, the user's messages are a bit confusing. Let me recheck the sequence.\n\nActually, the user's messages are a bit tangled. Let me try to reconstruct the game history based on the provided hints and my previous moves:\n\n1. First round: I played paper, opponent scissors \u2192 I lost.\n2. Second round: I played rock, opponent paper \u2192 I lost.\n3. Third round: I played scissors, opponent scissors \u2192 tie.\n4. Fourth round: I played paper, opponent rock \u2192 I won.\n5. Fifth round: I played rock, opponent scissors \u2192 I won.\n6. Sixth round: I played scissors, opponent rock \u2192 I lost.\n7. Seventh round: I played paper, opponent paper \u2192 tie.\n8. Eighth round: I played scissors, opponent paper \u2192 I won.\n9. Ninth round: I played paper, opponent scissors \u2192 I lost.\n10. Tenth round: I played scissors, opponent scissors \u2192 tie.\n11. Eleventh round: I played paper, opponent scissors \u2192 I lost.\n12. Twelfth round: I played scissors, opponent paper \u2192 I won.\n13. Thirteenth round: I played paper, opponent scissors \u2192 I lost.\n14. Now, the current round: I need to make a move after losing with paper against their scissors.\n\nSo the opponent's recent moves are: scissors (Round 13), scissors (Round 11), paper (Round 12), scissors (Round 9), etc. They seem to be using scissors frequently after wins. For example, in Round 13, they beat my paper with scissors. Now, they might expect me to switch to rock. If they think I'll play rock, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors again, I should play rock. But they might be aware that I might expect them to switch to paper, so they could stay with scissors. It's a mind game.\n\nAnother approach is to use a counter-strategy. Since they just played scissors, the most common response would be to play rock. If they expect that, they'll play paper. So I can play scissors to beat their expected paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll counter their scissors with rock, they play paper, so I play scissors. But if they instead decide to repeat scissors, then scissors ties with scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a pattern of playing scissors after a win. Let's see their last few wins:\n\n- Round 1: scissors (win)\n- Round 2: paper (win)\n- Round 6: rock (win)\n- Round 9: scissors (win)\n- Round 11: scissors (win)\n- Round 13: scissors (win)\n\nSo after a win with scissors, they sometimes repeat it (Round 11 and 13). So maybe they are sticking with scissors after winning with it. If that's the case, I should play rock. But in Round 11, after they won with scissors, they played scissors again in Round 13. Wait, the sequence is a bit unclear. Let me check:\n\nAfter Round 9: they won with scissors (beating my paper)\nThen in Round 10: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\nThen Round 11: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\nThen Round 12: I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\nThen Round 13: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n\nSo after Round 9's win with scissors, in Round 10 they played scissors again (tie). Then in Round 11, they played scissors again (win). Then in Round 12, they switched to paper (losing to my scissors). Then in Round 13, they went back to scissors (winning against my paper). So their pattern seems to be using scissors multiple times, especially after a win. So maybe they are favoring scissors. If that's the case, I should play rock. But they might expect that and switch to paper. Alternatively, they might continue with scissors.\n\nGiven that they've used scissors three times in the last four rounds (Rounds 11, 13, and 10), maybe they are sticking with it. So playing rock would beat scissors. But if they anticipate that and play paper, I lose. It's a risk. Alternatively, if I play scissors again, it could tie if they repeat, or lose if they play rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they repeat the move that just won. Since they just won with scissors, they'll play scissors again. So I should play rock. But in Round 11, after winning with scissors in Round 9, they played scissors again in Round 11. Then after losing in Round 12 (when I played scissors), they went back to scissors in Round 13. So they might have a tendency to revert to scissors after a loss. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy. If they win with a move, they repeat it; if they lose, they switch. Let's check:\n\n- Round 1: scissors (win) \u2192 Round 2: paper (switch) \u2192 so didn't stay.\n- Round 2: paper (win) \u2192 Round 3: scissors (switch) \u2192 didn't stay.\n- Round 3: scissors (tie) \u2192 Round 4: rock (switch) \u2192 but tie isn't a win, so maybe not applicable.\n- Round 6: rock (win) \u2192 Round 7: paper (switch) \u2192 didn't stay.\n- Round 9: scissors (win) \u2192 Round 10: scissors (stay) \u2192 yes.\n- Round 10: scissors (tie) \u2192 Round 11: scissors (stay) \u2192 but tie isn't a win.\n- Round 11: scissors (win) \u2192 Round 12: paper (switch) \u2192 didn't stay.\n- Round 13: scissors (win) \u2192 Next move: ?\n\nSo in Round 9, they won with scissors and stayed with scissors in Round 10 (tie). Then in Round 11, they won with scissors again. Then in Round 12, they switched to paper (lost), then in Round 13, went back to scissors (win). So their pattern isn't consistent with \"win-stay, lose-shift\". \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to assume they might repeat scissors, so play rock. But given that they've beaten my rock before (e.g., Round 2, they played paper when I played rock), they might expect rock and counter with paper. Alternatively, if they keep using scissors, rock is safe. \n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten me multiple times with scissors, maybe they'll expect me to counter with rock, so they'll play paper. To counter that, I should play scissors. But if they actually play scissors again, scissors ties. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe a mixed strategy is better, but since I have to choose one move, I'll have to predict based on their recent behavior. They've used scissors three times in the last four rounds. Maybe they'll switch to paper expecting my rock. So I'll play scissors to beat their paper. If they do play paper, I win. If they play scissors again, it's a tie. If they play rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they continue with scissors, rock is better. But given that they might anticipate rock and switch to paper, scissors is safer. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, considering that they just won with scissors, they might think I'll play rock, so they play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors. But if they stick with scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. But given their tendency to switch after a win sometimes, maybe paper. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the last round, they played scissors and won. If they think I'll play rock to counter, they'll play paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. If they instead play scissors again, it's a tie. If they play rock, I lose. But given that they've been using scissors frequently, maybe they'll stick with it. \n\nAlternatively, since I just lost with paper, they might expect me to switch to rock. So they play paper. Therefore, I play scissors. \n\nI think the best bet is to play scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. If they do, I win. If they stay with scissors, tie. If they play rock, I lose. But given their recent pattern, they might switch to paper after a win with scissors. So scissors is the move.\n",

But wait, they might also stick with rock again if they think I'll stay with rock. Hmm. Alternatively, after a tie, they might switch to a different move. Let me consider the patterns.\n\nIn previous rounds, after a tie, they sometimes repeated the move. For example, after two paper ties, they went paper again, and I beat them with scissors. But after a rock tie, maybe they'll switch. If I go paper, I can beat rock again. But if they expect that and go scissors, I lose.

If they go scissors, rock would win. If they go paper, I need scissors. This is getting confusing.\n\nLooking at their recent moves: they've been switching between rock, paper, scissors. After a tie with rock, maybe they'll switch to paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they stay with rock, scissors lose. Alternatively, if I choose paper, I beat rock but lose to scissors. Hmm. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their responses. When I played rock and they tied, what did they do next?

Then after the tie, maybe they'll switch again. If they think I'll play paper next, they might go scissors. So if I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they think I'm going to play rock again, they might play paper. This is a bit of a guessing game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating moves. Let's see their recent sequence: scissors (win), rock (tie), then before that, paper (loss), scissors (loss), rock (tie), paper (tie), scissors (win), etc. It's hard to see a clear pattern. They might be trying to counter my previous moves. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors. When I played scissors, they played rock. When I played rock, they played paper. Wait, that seems like they're countering my last move. Let me check:\n\n- When I played paper, they played scissors (beat me).\n- When I played scissors, they played rock (beat me).\n- When I played rock, they played paper (beat me).\n- Then when I played paper again, they played scissors again.\n- Then when I played scissors, they played rock again.\n- Then when I played rock, they played paper again.\n\nSo it seems like they are consistently countering my previous move. If that's the case, then whatever I played last, they will play the move that beats it. For example, if I last played rock, they will play paper. If I last played paper, they play scissors. If I last played scissors, they play rock.\n\nIn the last round, I played rock, and they played rock (tie). Wait, no, the last move was a tie with rock. So according to the pattern, if I played rock last, they would play paper next. So if I play scissors now, scissors beats paper. But if they are following the pattern of countering my last move (rock), they'll play paper. So scissors would win. But maybe they are not following that pattern anymore. Alternatively, after a tie, they might repeat the same move. If they played rock last and tied, they might play rock again. Then I should play paper. But if they switch to paper, I should play scissors. It's a bit of a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a different strategy. Since they've been countering my moves, maybe I can exploit that. If I expect them to counter my last move (rock) with paper, I should play scissors.

If I play scissors, and they counter with paper, I win. Wait, no. If they counter my last move (rock) with paper, then I should play scissors. But if they don't counter and instead play rock again, scissors lose. So it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are not strictly countering but have some other pattern. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play paper, expecting them to play rock again. But they might have switched to paper. Alternatively, if they are countering, then paper would lose to their scissors. Wait, no. If they counter my last move (rock) with paper, then I should play scissors. But if they are not countering, maybe they play rock again. So scissors would lose. This is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a mixed strategy. But since I need to choose one move, I'll have to make a guess. Based on the previous pattern where they countered my last move, I'll assume they will play paper to counter my last rock. Therefore, I should play scissors. But in the last round, when I played rock and they tied, maybe they'll stick with rock again. Then I should play paper. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with the counter-strategy. If they counter, scissors beats their expected paper. If they don't, I lose. Alternatively, if I play paper, I beat rock but lose to scissors. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back, after a tie, the opponent sometimes repeated the move. For example, after two paper ties, they played paper again. So maybe after a rock tie, they'll play rock again.

Opponent: scissors (tie with scissors)\n4. Opponent: rock (I lost with scissors)\n5. Opponent: paper (tie with paper)\n6. Opponent: paper (I won with scissors)\n7.

Opponent: rock (tie with rock)\n12. Opponent: scissors (tie with scissors)\n\nHmm, it's a bit inconsistent. But the last two were rock and scissors, both leading to ties. Maybe the opponent is trying to predict my moves based on my previous choices. For example, if I played rock last time, they might expect me to play paper next, so they play scissors. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a simple strategy like repeating their last move if they won or changing if they lost. Let's see:\n\nAfter they won with scissors (against my paper), they next played rock (I lost with scissors). Then when I played scissors and they played scissors (tie). Then when I played rock, they played rock (tie). Then scissors again (tie). So maybe they're sticking with scissors after a tie. But after the tie with scissors, they played scissors again. Wait, the last two times we both played scissors, so they might think I'll switch to rock, so they might play paper. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Like rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock. But looking at their moves: scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors. Doesn't seem like a clear cycle.\n\nAnother approach: since the last two ties were scissors, maybe they'll switch to something else. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. But how to predict?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, if I played scissors last time, they might play rock. But in the last round, I played scissors, they played scissors (tie). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I played scissors, they play rock next. But in the last round, I played scissors, they played scissors. So that doesn't fit either.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should try to find a pattern in their responses to my moves. Let's see:\n\nMy previous move was scissors (tie). Before that, rock (tie). Before that, scissors (tie). So three consecutive ties. They might be getting frustrated and changing their strategy. Maybe they'll switch to a move that beats the one I've been playing. Since I've been playing scissors and rock leading to ties, maybe they expect me to play paper next. If they play scissors to beat paper, then I should play rock. But if they think I'll play rock, they might play paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since we've had three ties in a row (scissors, rock, scissors), maybe they'll try to break the pattern by playing something different. If they played scissors last time, maybe they'll switch to rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they think I'll play paper, they might play scissors. It's a bit of a guessing game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a random strategy. In that case, the best I can do is play each move equally often. But since the opponent is a human, maybe they have a pattern. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to play rock. Because if they expect me to switch from scissors to paper (to beat their expected rock), they might play scissors again. But if they play scissors, rock would beat it. Wait, no: rock beats scissors. So if I play rock and they play scissors, I win. If they play paper, I lose. If they play rock, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, if they've been playing scissors a lot, maybe they'll stick with it. So rock would be good. But in the last round, they played scissors, so maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I'll play rock to beat their scissors, so they play paper. Then I should play scissors. But that's getting too meta.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should go with a move that's less predictable. Since the last three ties were scissors, rock, scissors, maybe they'll expect me to play paper. If they play scissors to beat paper, then I should play rock. But if they think that, they might play paper to beat my rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors again. So rock would be good.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The user is playing a game of rock-paper-scissors against an opponent. The history shows that the opponent has been making moves that counter the user's previous choices. The user has tried various strategies, like predicting the opponent's next move based on their previous actions, but the opponent seems to be adapting.\n\nIn the last few rounds, the user tried scissors expecting the opponent to repeat paper, but the opponent switched to rock. Then, the user chose paper, but the opponent went with scissors again. The user then tried rock, leading to a tie, and then scissors again, resulting in another tie. The latest move was rock, which the opponent countered with paper.\n\nNow, after the user's rock lost to the opponent's paper, the user needs to decide the next move. The opponent has been switching between moves, often countering the user's previous choice. For example, when the user played paper, the opponent chose scissors; when the user played scissors, the opponent chose rock. This suggests the opponent is anticipating the user's next move based on past patterns.\n\nTo break this cycle, the user might need to introduce some unpredictability. Since the opponent has been countering the user's last move, perhaps the user should choose a move that beats the opponent's likely counter. For instance, if the opponent expects the user to switch from rock to paper (to counter the opponent's previous paper), the opponent might choose scissors. In that case, the user should play rock to beat scissors.\n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's tendency to counter, the user could play the same move again if the opponent expects a change. But given the recent pattern, the opponent might stick with their strategy. Let's analyze the last few moves:\n\n- User: rock (tie) \u2192 opponent: rock\n- User: scissors (tie) \u2192 opponent: scissors\n- User: rock (lost) \u2192 opponent: paper\n- Now, the user needs to choose a move that beats what the opponent will pick next.\n\nIf the opponent expects the user to switch from rock to paper (to beat the opponent's previous paper), the opponent might choose scissors to beat paper. Therefore, the user should choose rock to beat scissors. However, the opponent might also anticipate this and stick with paper. Alternatively, the opponent might switch back to rock, expecting the user to choose scissors. This is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to look for patterns in the opponent's moves. The opponent's recent moves: scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper. It seems they alternate between countering the user's previous move and switching. Maybe after playing paper, they might go back to rock. If the user plays paper again, they might expect scissors and choose rock. But the user just played rock and lost to paper, so maybe the opponent will stick with paper or switch to scissors.\n\nAlternatively, the user could choose scissors, expecting the opponent to play paper again. But the opponent might anticipate that and choose rock. This is tricky. Perhaps the best move is to go with paper, expecting the opponent to repeat their previous successful move (paper), but since they just won with paper, they might switch to scissors. Wait, no: if the user's last move was rock, and the opponent countered with paper, the opponent might expect the user to play paper next, so they would choose scissors. Therefore, the user should choose rock to beat scissors. But this is a bit of a loop.\n\nAlternatively, the user could cycle through the moves in a non-predictable way. Since the opponent is countering based on the user's last move, maybe the user should choose the move that beats the opponent's expected counter. For example, if the user last played rock, the opponent expects paper, so the opponent would choose scissors. Therefore, the user should choose rock again to beat scissors. Wait, but the opponent just beat rock with paper. If the user plays rock again, the opponent might expect that and play paper again. So the user should play scissors to beat paper. But the opponent might anticipate that and play rock. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to use a mixed strategy, but since the user is trying to predict, perhaps the opponent is sticking to a pattern of countering the user's last move. So, after the user played rock and lost to paper, the opponent might expect the user to switch to paper. Therefore, the opponent would choose scissors. The user can then choose rock to beat scissors. But the opponent might instead stick with paper, thinking the user will stay on rock. Alternatively, the opponent might switch to scissors to counter the expected paper. It's a bit of a guessing game.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to choose paper. If the opponent expects the user to switch from rock to paper, they'll choose scissors, which would lose to rock. But the user is choosing paper, which would lose to scissors. Alternatively, if the opponent sticks with paper, it's a tie. If the opponent switches to rock, paper wins. It's a gamble. Alternatively, choosing scissors could beat paper if the opponent repeats, but they might switch to rock. \n\nWait, the opponent's last move was paper, which beat the user's rock. If the user now chooses scissors, they would beat paper. But the opponent might expect that and switch to rock. Alternatively, the opponent might stick with paper, thinking the user will stay on rock. It's hard to tell. \n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to counter, maybe the user should choose scissors to beat the opponent's expected paper. But if the opponent anticipates that, they'll choose rock. Alternatively, the user could choose paper, expecting the opponent to stay on paper, leading to a tie. \n\nAlternatively, since the opponent has been countering the user's previous move, after the user played rock, the opponent might expect paper next and choose scissors. Therefore, the user should choose rock to beat scissors. But the opponent might not follow that pattern. \n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the best move is to go with scissors, hoping the opponent repeats paper. But given the recent history, the opponent might switch. Alternatively, choose paper to either tie or win if the opponent plays rock. \n\nAfter considering all possibilities, the user might decide to play scissors, expecting the opponent to repeat paper. However, given the opponent's adaptability, this might not work. Alternatively, play paper to counter a potential rock. But the opponent just played paper, so they might switch. \n\nIn the end, the user needs to make a decision. Based on the opponent's last move being paper, and the user's last move being rock, the opponent might expect the user to switch to paper, so they choose scissors. Therefore, the user should choose rock to beat scissors. But the opponent might not follow that. Alternatively, the user could choose paper to either tie or beat rock. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to choose paper, hoping the opponent stays on paper for a tie or switches to rock, which paper would beat. Alternatively, if the opponent switches to scissors, the user loses. It's a risk, but given the opponent's recent moves, they might stick with paper again. \n\nWait, the opponent's last two moves were paper and scissors. Before that, rock. They seem to alternate. Maybe after paper, they'll switch to scissors again. If the user plays rock, they can beat scissors. But the opponent might switch to paper again. \n\nThis is really a tough call. Maybe the user should choose scissors, expecting the opponent to play paper again. But the opponent might have switched to rock. Alternatively, choose paper to counter rock. \n\nAfter all this, I think the best move is to choose scissors, hoping the opponent repeats paper. But given the opponent's pattern of countering, maybe not. Alternatively, choose paper to tie or win against rock. \n\nWait, the user's last move was rock, which lost to paper. The opponent's last move was paper. If the user now chooses scissors, they can beat paper. But the opponent might expect that and choose rock. So scissors would lose. Alternatively, the user could choose paper, which would tie if the opponent stays on paper, or lose if the opponent chooses scissors. \n\nAlternatively, the user could choose rock again, expecting the opponent to switch to scissors. But the opponent might stay on paper. \n\nThis is a loop. Maybe the best approach is to choose scissors, hoping the opponent stays on paper. If they do, user wins. If they switch to rock, user loses. It's a 50-50 chance. \n\nAlternatively, the user could choose paper, leading to a tie if the opponent stays, or a win if the opponent switches to rock. \n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to counter, perhaps the opponent expects the user to switch from rock to paper, so they choose scissors. Therefore, the user should choose rock to beat scissors. But the opponent might not do that. \n\nIn conclusion, after considering all possibilities, the user might choose scissors to beat the opponent's expected paper, but there's a risk. Alternatively, choose paper to tie or win against rock. Given the uncertainty, I'll go with scissors.\n",

If they played rock twice in a row, maybe they'll switch. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with paper again, hoping they stick with rock. But last time I played paper, they played rock and I won. Then they played rock again, I played scissors and lost. So maybe they're sticking with rock. So paper would be the right move. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch back to paper, they might go scissors. But scissors lose to rock. Wait, no, scissors beat paper. If they think I'll play paper, they might play scissors. So if I play rock, I can beat their scissors. But this is getting too much into mind games. Maybe the safest bet is to play paper again, assuming they stick with rock. But given that they've used rock twice, maybe they'll switch. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they have a pattern of using the same move after a win. They won with rock, then used rock again. If they win again, maybe they'll keep using it. So I should play paper. Let's go with paper.\n",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
