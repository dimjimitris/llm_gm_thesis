From what I know, new players often tend to choose rock first because it's the most straightforward option. So if I choose paper, that would beat rock. But wait, maybe the other player is aware of this common strategy and might choose paper to counter my expected rock. Hmm, but since they're new, they might not overthink it. Alternatively, they could go for scissors thinking I'll choose paper. But sticking with the initial thought, new players usually start with rock. So paper seems like the safe bet. Let me confirm the rules again: paper beats rock, giving me +1. If they do pick rock, I win. If they pick something else, like scissors, then I lose. But statistically, rock is a common first choice. I'll go with paper.\n",

Hmm, the hint said that new players often start with rock, which is why I went with paper. But this time, the opponent picked scissors. Maybe they thought I would stick with the same strategy? Or perhaps they're trying to counter the common advice that new players start with rock.\n\nWait, maybe after losing once, the opponent expects me to switch. Let me think. If I played paper first, and they beat me with scissors, they might think I'll switch to scissors next to beat their scissors. But if they expect that, they might go with rock. Alternatively, they might stick with scissors again, thinking I'll stay with paper. Or maybe they're randomizing their moves.\n\nSince this is a new player, maybe they don't have a fixed pattern yet. But after the first round, they might be trying to predict my move. If I lost with paper, maybe I should try a different approach. Let's consider possible patterns. If they played scissors last time, what's the best counter? Rock beats scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. Alternatively, they might repeat scissors if they think I'll stay on paper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. But without more data, it's hard to tell. Since they just beat me with scissors, maybe they'll expect me to play rock next. To counter that, they might play paper. So if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But this is getting a bit too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go with the classic strategy of playing what beats their last move. Their last move was scissors, so I should play rock. But if they think I'll do that, they might play paper. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe I should randomize my moves to avoid being predictable. But since I'm supposed to maximize points, perhaps I need to find a pattern.\n\nWait, another angle: new players might not follow advanced strategies. After winning with scissors, they might stick with it again, thinking it's a good move. If that's the case, I should play rock this time. But if they switch to rock expecting me to play rock, then paper would be better. But how to decide?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they alternate moves. First scissors, then rock? If that's the case, I should play paper. But this is all guesswork. Since I don't have much data, maybe the best bet is to counter their last move. Since they played scissors, I play rock. But if they expect that, they'll play paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll counter their scissors with rock, they might play paper, so I should play scissors to beat paper. This is getting into a loop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a simple strategy like always playing the move that beats their last move. So after scissors, they might play rock (since rock beats scissors). If that's the case, I should play paper. But I'm not sure. Without more information, it's hard to predict. Maybe the safest move is to switch to scissors, expecting them to play paper. Or stick with paper again, thinking they might switch to rock. Wait, if they played scissors last time and won, maybe they'll stick with it again. So rock would beat scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. This is a classic game theory problem.\n\nIn rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy is to randomize moves to avoid being predictable. But since this is a one-off round, maybe I should try to outguess them. Given that they just won with scissors, perhaps they'll stick with it again, so rock would be good. Alternatively, they might switch to rock, expecting me to counter with rock, so I should play paper. But this is all speculative. Maybe the best approach is to choose the move that beats their last move. So scissors \u2192 rock. Let's go with rock.\n",

Let's start by looking at the history of the game so far.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper because I thought the opponent, being new, might pick rock. But they chose scissors, so I lost. Then in the second round, they played scissors again, and I countered with rock, which worked.

Alternatively, they might think I'll change from rock to something else, so they might stay with scissors again. But that's less likely since scissors just lost to rock. \n\nWait, another angle: players often try to counter the last winning move. Since I won with rock, they might think I'll play rock again and choose paper. To counter that, I should play scissors. But maybe they'll try to be unpredictable. If they switch to paper, scissors would win. If they switch to rock, then paper would be better. But considering they just played scissors twice in a row, maybe they have a pattern. Or maybe they'll vary their moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern like rock-paper-scissors in order. First round they did scissors, then scissors again. Wait, no, first round they did scissors, then scissors again. Wait, no, first round they did scissors (I played paper, they played scissors), then second round they played scissors again (I played rock). So they played scissors twice. Maybe they'll change now.

If they stay with scissors, I should play rock again. But since I just played rock and won, they might expect me to play rock again and choose paper. So to counter that, I should play scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to break the cycle. It's a bit tricky. Since they've played scissors twice, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to rock, paper would win. If they switch to paper, scissors would win. If they stay with scissors, rock wins. \n\nBut considering that they lost the last round with scissors, they might switch. So I need to predict their next move.

They played scissors twice. Maybe they're sticking with scissors. But that's unlikely. More probable they'll switch. Let's assume they switch to paper. Then scissors would be the move. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, paper. \n\nAlternatively, use a counter-strategy. Since I played rock last time, they might expect me to play paper next (following rock-paper-scissors order). If they think that, they might play scissors to beat my expected paper. Then I should play rock again to beat their scissors. Wait, but that's a loop. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I'm supposed to think strategically, perhaps look for a pattern. They played scissors twice. Maybe they'll go for rock next.

So scissors would be good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll think I'll switch from rock to paper, so they choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. \n\nHmm. This is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the safest bet is to play paper, expecting them to switch to rock after two scissors. Or play scissors expecting them to play paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've played scissors twice, maybe they'll go for rock. So paper would beat that. \n\nI think I'll go with paper, expecting them to switch to rock. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors again. Then rock would win. \n\nWait, but if they think I'll expect them to switch, they might stay with scissors. So rock again. \n\nBut this is a lot of overthinking. Maybe the best approach is to cycle through moves. I played paper, then rock. Next could be scissors. But that's predictable. \n\nAlternatively, use the fact that they played scissors twice. Maybe they have a tendency. If they do scissors again, rock. If they switch, adjust. \n\nBut since I can't know, perhaps the optimal move is to choose paper, expecting them to switch to rock.

Let's list their moves:\n\nRound 1: scissors (win)\nRound 2: scissors (loss)\nRound 3: paper (tie)\n\nSo after winning with scissors, they tried scissors again but lost. Then they switched to paper.

Maybe the best approach is to play rock, expecting them to play scissors again, but they just played paper. Alternatively, since they tied with paper, they might switch to rock. If I play paper again, I can beat rock. But if they play scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a random strategy. In that case, the best I can do is play each move equally, but since this is a series, there's a pattern. \n\nWait, considering their last three moves: scissors, scissors, paper. The transition is scissors to scissors to paper. Maybe they're following a pattern of moving to the next move in the cycle. Rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock. But they went from scissors to scissors to paper. So maybe after two scissors, they go paper, then next is rock. If that's the case, I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my moves. Let's see my moves: paper, rock, paper. Their responses: scissors (beats paper), scissors (loses to rock), paper (ties with paper). So when I played paper, they countered with scissors. When I played rock, they stayed with scissors. When I played paper again, they played paper. So maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. If I played paper last time, they might play scissors again. But in the third round, they played paper when I played paper. So maybe they're mirroring. \n\nIf they mirror my last move, then since I played paper, they'll play paper again. But that would be a tie. To avoid that, I should play scissors to beat their paper.

So I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let's recap:\n\nOpponent's moves: scissors, scissors, paper.\n\nMy moves: paper, rock, paper.\n\nRound 1: I played paper, they played scissors. I lost.\n\nRound 2: I played rock, they played scissors. I won.\n\nRound 3: I played paper, they played paper. Tie.\n\nNow, for Round 4. What's the opponent's next move?\n\nPossible patterns:\n\n1. They might think I'll switch to scissors to beat their last paper. So they play rock to beat scissors. If I play paper, I beat rock.\n\n2. They might stick with paper again, leading to another tie if I also play paper.\n\n3. They might switch to scissors again, thinking I'll play rock again. But I just played paper twice.\n\nAlternatively, they could be cycling through moves. From scissors to scissors to paper, maybe next is rock.\n\nIf they cycle scissors -> scissors -> paper -> rock, then I should play paper to beat rock.\n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my previous move. Since I played paper last time, they might play scissors again. So I should play rock.\n\nBut in Round 3, when I played paper again, they played paper. So maybe they mirrored my move. If that's the case, they might mirror again, leading to another tie if I play paper. But I don't want a tie. So maybe I should switch to scissors to beat their expected paper. But if they mirror, they would play paper again, so scissors would win. However, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to play rock, expecting them to play scissors again. But they just played paper, so that's less likely. Alternatively, play scissors to beat paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, considering that they've played paper once, maybe they'll switch back to scissors. But they already played scissors twice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a \"defensive\" strategy, playing the move that would have beaten their last move. Since their last move was paper, they might play scissors (since scissors beats paper). If that's the case, I should play rock to beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might be using a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy, playing the move that I played last. Since I played paper last, they play paper again. So I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut in Round 3, when I played paper, they played paper. So if they're doing tit-for-tat, they'll play paper again. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut if they think I'll do that, they might play rock. \n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. However, given that they mirrored my paper in Round 3, maybe they'll do it again. So I'll play scissors to beat their expected paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, I win. \n\nAlternatively, since they tied with paper, they might switch to rock, expecting me to stay on paper. So I should play paper again. But that would tie if they also play paper. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to cycle through moves. I played paper, rock, paper. Next, I could play scissors. But that's random. \n\nAlternatively, look for their tendencies. They played scissors twice, then paper. Maybe they're avoiding repeating the same move three times. So after two scissors, they switched to paper. Now, after one paper, they might switch again. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock. \n\nBut it's unclear. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play scissors, expecting them to repeat paper. If they do, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they play scissors, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, play rock, expecting them to play scissors again. But they just played paper, so that's less likely. \n\nAlternatively, play paper again, expecting them to switch to rock. \n\nWait, in Round 3, they played paper when I played paper. If they continue to mirror, they'll play paper again. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. \n\nThis is a mind game. Given that they mirrored my paper last time, maybe they'll do it again. So scissors would beat their paper. But if they anticipate that, they'll play rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost when they played scissors against my rock, maybe they'll avoid scissors. So they might play rock or paper. \n\nI think the most logical move here is to play scissors, expecting them to stick with paper. But given that they just tied with paper, they might switch. Alternatively, play rock to beat scissors if they go back. \n\nAlternatively, since they've played scissors twice and paper once, maybe they'll go back to scissors. But that's not a clear pattern. \n\nAlternatively, use a counter to their last move. Their last move was paper, so I play scissors. \n\nBut considering all possibilities, I'll go with scissors.\n",

But they also chose paper, leading to a tie. So they might have anticipated my move.\n\nFourth round: I went scissors, thinking they'd stay with paper. But they also chose scissors, another tie. Now they might be trying to mirror my previous move or predict my strategy.\n\nLooking for patterns: The opponent's moves so far are scissors, scissors, paper, scissors. Wait, no, let me check again. Wait, the results were:\n\nRound 1: Opponent scissors (I chose paper)\nRound 2: Opponent scissors (I chose rock)\nRound 3: Opponent paper (I chose paper)\nRound 4: Opponent scissors (I chose scissors)\n\nWait, the fourth round, both chose scissors. So opponent's moves: scissors, scissors, paper, scissors. So they alternated between scissors and paper. Let me list them:\n\n1. scissors\n2. scissors\n3. paper\n4. scissors\n\nHmm, not a clear pattern. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Let's see my moves:\n\n1. paper\n2. rock\n3. paper\n4. scissors\n\nSo after I played paper (they played scissors), then I played rock (they scissors again), then paper (they paper), then scissors (they scissors). Maybe they are playing the move that would beat my previous move. Let's check:\n\nAfter I played paper (they played scissors, which beats paper). Then I played rock, they played scissors (which loses to rock). Wait, that doesn't fit. Then I played paper again, they played paper (tie). Then I played scissors, they played scissors (tie). Hmm, maybe they are mirroring my previous move? Let's see:\n\nMy previous move before each of their moves:\n\nRound 1: My first move was paper. Their response: scissors (beats paper)\nRound 2: My move was rock. Their response: scissors (loses to rock)\nRound 3: My move was paper. Their response: paper (same)\nRound 4: My move was scissors. Their response: scissors (same)\n\nSo maybe they started by countering my first move, then tried to counter again but failed, then started mirroring. Alternatively, maybe they're alternating between countering and mirroring. It's a bit inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a simple strategy like rotating through moves. Let's see their sequence: scissors, scissors, paper, scissors. Not a clear rotation. Maybe they're trying to predict my moves based on my history. Let's look at my moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors. If the opponent is trying to predict my next move based on my previous, they might think I'll switch again. My moves have been paper, then rock, then paper, then scissors. So maybe they expect me to go back to rock? If they think I'll play rock, they might play paper. But in the last round, I played scissors, so if they expect me to repeat, they might play scissors again. But last time I played scissors, they also played scissors. If they think I'll switch, maybe they'll play rock to counter scissors. Wait, if I played scissors last time, the counter would be rock. So if they expect me to play scissors again, they might play rock. But in that case, I should play paper to beat their expected rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch from scissors to rock, they might play paper. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, after I played scissors, the move that beats scissors is rock. So they might play rock next. If that's the case, I should play paper to beat their expected rock. Let's test this hypothesis. If the opponent's strategy is to play the move that beats my last move, then:\n\nMy last move was scissors. The move that beats scissors is rock. So they would play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat rock. That would work. But how accurate is this assumption? Let's check previous rounds:\n\nRound 1: I played paper. The move that beats paper is scissors. They played scissors. So that fits.\n\nRound 2: I played rock. The move that beats rock is paper. But they played scissors, which doesn't fit. So maybe that's not their strategy.\n\nWait, in round 2, if they were following the strategy of playing the move that beats my last move, after I played paper (which they countered with scissors), then when I played rock next, they should have played paper. But they played scissors again. So that breaks the pattern. So maybe that's not their strategy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a different pattern. Let's see their moves again: scissors, scissors, paper, scissors. Maybe they are favoring scissors, but occasionally switching. Three out of four times they played scissors. So maybe they have a bias towards scissors. If that's the case, playing rock would beat scissors. But in round 3, they played paper, which would lose to rock. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my expected counter. For example, after I lost with paper against their scissors, I switched to rock, which beat their scissors. Then they might expect me to stick with rock, so they played paper in round 3. But I played paper again, leading to a tie. Then in round 4, I switched to scissors, which they countered with scissors again. \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to find a pattern in their moves. Let's list their moves:\n\nRound 1: scissors\n\nRound 2: scissors\n\nRound 3: paper\n\nRound 4: scissors\n\nSo scissors, scissors, paper, scissors. The only time they deviated was round 3. Maybe they thought I would play rock again after winning with rock in round 2, so they played paper in round 3. But I played paper, leading to a tie. Then in round 4, they went back to scissors. Maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper? But the sequence doesn't show that. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my previous move's outcome. For example, when I won with rock, they switched to paper. But when I tied with paper, they went back to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a simple rotation. Let's see: scissors, scissors, paper, scissors. Not a clear rotation. Maybe they are trying to play the move that I played two turns ago. Let's check:\n\nRound 1: my move paper, their scissors.\n\nRound 2: my move rock, their scissors.\n\nRound 3: my move paper, their paper.\n\nRound 4: my move scissors, their scissors.\n\nIf they are following my move two turns prior:\n\nRound 3: two moves before was paper (round 1), so they play paper.\n\nRound 4: two moves before was rock (round 2), so they play scissors (which beats rock). But they played scissors, which does beat rock. Hmm, that could fit. Let's see:\n\nIf their strategy is to play the move that beats my move from two rounds ago:\n\nRound 1: no prior two moves, so maybe random.\n\nRound 2: two moves before (none), so maybe scissors again.\n\nRound 3: two moves before round 1 (paper), so play scissors. But they played paper. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe they are using a different pattern. \n\nAlternatively, considering that in the last two rounds, when I played paper and then scissors, they played paper and scissors respectively. So maybe they are mirroring my last move. Let's check:\n\nRound 3: I played paper, they played paper.\n\nRound 4: I played scissors, they played scissors.\n\nIf that's the case, then they are mirroring my previous move. So if I played scissors last time, they will play scissors again. Therefore, if I play rock, which beats scissors, I can win. But wait, in round 3, I played paper, they mirrored with paper. Then in round 4, I played scissors, they mirrored with scissors. If this pattern continues, they will play whatever I played last. So if I played scissors last, they will play scissors again. Therefore, I should play rock to beat scissors. \n\nBut wait, in round 3, after I played paper, they mirrored. Then in round 4, after I played scissors, they mirrored. So if the pattern is mirroring, then next they will play whatever I played last, which was scissors. So I should play rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to counter the move that would beat their last move. For example, in round 4, they played scissors. The move that beats scissors is rock. So they might expect me to play rock, so they would play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut this is speculative. Without a clear pattern, it's challenging. Another approach is to use a mixed strategy to avoid being predictable. However, since this is a text-based interaction and the opponent might be a human or a bot with a certain pattern, I need to look for tendencies. \n\nGiven that the opponent has played scissors three times out of four, maybe they have a preference for scissors. If that's the case, playing rock would be advantageous. However, in round 3, they switched to paper, which might indicate they can adapt. \n\nAlternatively, considering the last two rounds were ties when I mirrored their previous move (paper and scissors). If they notice that I mirrored, they might expect me to do it again and counter accordingly. For example, if I mirrored their last move (scissors), they might expect me to play scissors again and counter with rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat their expected rock. \n\nBut this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the safest bet is to assume they might play scissors again, given their tendency, so play rock. Alternatively, if they expect me to play rock after they played scissors, they might switch to paper. In that case, I should play scissors. \n\nAlternatively, considering the last two moves were scissors (theirs and mine), they might think I'll switch to rock, so they play paper. Then I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to rotate moves in a non-predictable way. Since I last played scissors, then rock, then paper, then scissors. Wait, my moves were paper, rock, paper, scissors. So the sequence is paper, rock, paper, scissors. Maybe I should continue rotating. Next would be rock again. But if the opponent is mirroring, they would play scissors again, so rock would win. \n\nAlternatively, if they are mirroring, they'll play scissors again, so rock is good. But if they are countering, they might play paper. \n\nHmm. Given the previous two ties when I mirrored their move (paper and scissors), maybe they'll try to break the tie by changing. If they played scissors last time and we tied, they might switch to rock to beat my scissors. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Without a clear pattern, it's challenging. Maybe the best approach is to play rock, expecting them to play scissors again, given their history. But they might have noticed that I played scissors last time and expect me to switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they tied with scissors last time, they might switch to rock. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with scissors again, so rock would win. \n\nThis is a bit of a gamble. Considering they've played scissors three times, maybe they have a bias. So I'll go with rock.\n",

Then I picked scissors, they picked scissors (tie). Then I chose rock, they chose rock (tie). \n\nHmm, so their moves in order were scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, rock. Wait, no.

That's a bit inconsistent. They started with scissors twice, then paper, then scissors again, then rock. Maybe they're trying to switch things up. \n\nLooking for patterns: They used scissors three times, paper once, rock once. Maybe they favor scissors. But after I countered with rock (which beat their scissors in round 2), they switched to paper in round 3.

But they chose rock in round 5, which tied with my rock. \n\nNow, for the next move, I need to predict what they'll do. If they chose rock last time, maybe they'll stick with rock again, or switch. If they think I'll play scissors to beat their previous rock, they might play rock again to counter scissors. Alternatively, they might switch to paper expecting me to stay with rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been switching between moves, maybe they'll go back to scissors. But their last move was rock. If I assume they might follow a pattern of rotating through moves, maybe after rock comes paper.

Wait, but if they expect me to think they'll switch to paper, they might stay with rock. This is getting a bit complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my moves. Let's see my previous moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock. So my last move was rock. If they think I'll repeat rock, they might play paper. So to counter that, I should play scissors. \n\nBut if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors to beat paper. Then I should play rock. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two ties were with rock, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should choose scissors. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Maybe the best approach is to look for any possible pattern. Their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, rock. So after scissors twice, paper, then scissors, then rock. Not a clear pattern. Maybe they're trying to avoid being predictable. \n\nAlternatively, they might be using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, after playing rock, they might play paper next (since paper beats rock). But that's speculative. \n\nAlternatively, since they played rock last time, maybe they'll go back to scissors, which they used more often. If I choose rock again, I can beat scissors. But if they choose paper, rock loses. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been choosing rock twice (round 2 and 5), maybe they expect me to choose rock again and will counter with paper. So I should choose scissors to beat their expected paper. \n\nBut this is a lot of overthinking. Maybe the safest move is to go with paper, expecting them to possibly play rock again. Wait, no, they just played rock. If they think I'll switch to paper to beat rock, they might play scissors. So if I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they stick with rock, I should play paper. But they might not. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to cycle through moves. My last move was rock. So next could be paper. But that's not necessarily a pattern. \n\nAlternatively, since the opponent's last move was rock, and they might expect me to counter with paper, so they might play scissors. Then I should play rock. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, given that they've played rock once, maybe they'll go back to scissors. So I should play rock again. But in the last round, they tied with me on rock. Maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they tied with rock, they might switch to paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should go with scissors, expecting them to choose paper. But if they choose rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since they've used scissors three times, maybe they'll go back to it. So rock would be good. \n\nBut their last move was rock. Maybe they'll switch. \n\nI think I'll go with scissors, hoping they choose paper. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, play paper to beat a possible rock. \n\nWait, their last move was rock. If they follow the same pattern as before, after rock they might go back to scissors. So rock would beat scissors. But if they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper. \n\nThis is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the best approach is to choose randomly, but given the history, perhaps scissors is a good choice. \n\nWait, but in the last round, both chose rock. If they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stay with rock, they might choose paper, so I should choose scissors. \n\nI'm getting stuck. Maybe I should just pick paper. If they played rock last time, maybe they'll play paper to counter my expected rock. Then scissors would beat paper. \n\nWait, no. If they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut if they think I'm switching to scissors, they might play rock. Then I lose. \n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. The optimal strategy is to be unpredictable, but since the opponent is a human (or another AI), maybe there's a pattern. \n\nAlternatively, since the opponent has played rock once, maybe they'll cycle through. Rock, then paper, then scissors. But their previous move was rock, so next would be paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut this is all speculative.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been switching their moves based on previous outcomes. Let me recap the history to spot a pattern.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they chose scissors. I lost. Then I switched to rock, which beat their scissors. Next, I picked paper again, but they also chose paper, leading to a tie. Then I went scissors, they did too. Then rock, they also rock. Then scissors beat their paper. Then paper beat their rock. \n\nLooking at their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock. Hmm. After losing with scissors to my rock, they switched to paper, which I then beat with scissors. Then when I used paper, they chose rock again. Wait, the last two times I won with scissors and paper. Now, they might expect me to continue a pattern. \n\nIf they lost with rock last time, maybe they'll switch to paper to beat my previous paper. But if I just used paper to beat their rock, they might think I'll stick with paper again, so they might go scissors to beat my paper. Alternatively, they might go back to rock if they think I'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been switching after losses, maybe they'll try to counter my last move. My last move was paper, which beats rock. If they think I'll repeat paper, they might choose scissors. To counter that, I should choose rock. But wait, if they choose scissors, rock would beat them. But if they think I'm switching from paper to rock, they might stay with paper. Hmm, this is getting a bit complex. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Their last move was rock, so next could be paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they think I'm going to counter their rock with paper again, they might choose scissors. So maybe I should choose rock to beat their possible scissors. \n\nWait, this is a bit of a mind game. Let's think about common patterns. After a loss, players often switch to the move that would have beaten their previous choice. For example, if they lost with rock, they might switch to paper next. But in the last round, they lost with rock to my paper. So they might switch to scissors to beat paper. If that's the case, I should choose rock to beat their scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stay with paper again, they might go scissors. So choosing rock would beat their scissors. But if they think I'm going to switch from paper to something else, maybe they'll stick with rock again. But that's less likely. \n\nAnother angle: looking at their move history. They played scissors twice, then paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock. It's a bit random, but there's a tendency to switch after a loss. After losing with rock, they might switch to paper. But in the previous instance, when they lost with scissors, they switched to paper. Wait, no: after I beat their scissors with rock, they switched to paper, which I then tied with. Then they went scissors again, which I also tied with. Then rock, which tied. Then I beat their paper with scissors, then their rock with paper. \n\nSo after losing with rock, they might switch to paper. But in the last round, they lost with rock, so maybe they'll switch to paper. If that's the case, I should choose scissors to beat paper. But if they think I expect them to switch to paper, they might stay with rock. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. My last move was paper, so they might choose scissors. To counter that, I should choose rock. \n\nBut I need to balance between predicting their next move based on their patterns and avoiding being too predictable myself. Since they've lost the last two rounds when they chose rock and paper, they might try to go back to scissors. If they go scissors, I should choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they're cycling through moves in order (rock, paper, scissors), their last move was rock, so next would be paper. Then I should choose scissors. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's tricky. Maybe the safest bet is to go with rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after their last rock loss. Or scissors to beat paper if they switch to paper. \n\nWait, let's think again. Their last move was rock, which lost to my paper. If they follow the \"lose, then switch to the move that would beat the move that just beat them\" pattern: my paper beat their rock, so they might choose scissors to beat paper. If they choose scissors, I should choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stick with paper again, they choose scissors. So rock beats scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch from paper to something else, maybe they'll stay with rock. But that's less likely. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps choosing rock is the best option here, anticipating they might go for scissors. Alternatively, if they switch to paper, then I lose. But given their history, after losing with rock, they might switch to paper. Wait, when they lost with scissors (first round), they switched to scissors again? Or maybe not. Let me check the exact sequence:\n\nRound 1: Opponent scissors (I chose paper, lost)\nRound 2: Opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\nRound 3: Opponent paper (I chose paper, tie)\nRound 4: Opponent scissors (I chose scissors, tie)\nRound 5: Opponent rock (I chose rock, tie)\nRound 6: Opponent paper (I chose scissors, won)\nRound 7: Opponent rock (I chose paper, won)\n\nSo after losing with scissors in round 1, they played scissors again in round 2. Then after losing with scissors in round 2, they switched to paper in round 3. Then after tying with paper in round 3, they went back to scissors in round 4. Then after tying with scissors in round 4, they switched to rock in round 5. Then after tying with rock in round 5, they went to paper in round 6. Then after losing with paper in round 6, they went to rock in round 7. \n\nHmm, their pattern seems a bit erratic. After a loss, they sometimes repeat the same move (round 1 to 2: scissors to scissors), but other times switch (round 2 to 3: scissors to paper; round 6 to 7: paper to rock). \n\nIn the last round, they lost with rock, so maybe they'll switch to paper. If that's the case, I should choose scissors. But if they instead switch to scissors (to beat my previous paper), then I should choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might think that since I've been using paper and scissors recently, they might expect me to use rock next. So they might choose paper to beat rock. In that case, I should choose scissors. \n\nThis is getting a bit too convoluted. Maybe a better approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list their moves again:\n\n1. scissors\n2. scissors\n3. paper\n4. scissors\n5. rock\n6. paper\n7. rock\n\nLooking at this, they alternated between scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock. It's hard to see a clear pattern. Maybe they're cycling through the moves but not in order. \n\nAlternatively, after two losses with scissors, they switched to paper. Then back to scissors, then rock, then paper, then rock. It's possible they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I chose rock (round 2), they went scissors again. When I chose paper (round 3), they went paper. When I chose scissors (round 4), they went scissors. When I chose rock (round 5), they went rock. When I chose scissors (round 6), they went paper. When I chose paper (round 7), they went rock. \n\nWait, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Let's see:\n\nMy move before their move in each round:\n\nRound 1: I chose paper, they chose scissors (scissors beats paper)\nRound 2: I chose rock, they chose scissors (rock beats scissors)\nRound 3: I chose paper, they chose paper (tie)\nRound 4: I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie)\nRound 5: I chose rock, they chose rock (tie)\nRound 6: I chose scissors, they chose paper (scissors beats paper)\nRound 7: I chose paper, they chose rock (paper beats rock)\n\nWait, in round 1, they beat my paper with scissors. In round 2, I beat their scissors with rock. In round 3, they tied my paper. Round 4, tied my scissors. Round 5, tied my rock. Round 6, I beat their paper with scissors. Round 7, I beat their rock with paper. \n\nSo the opponent's strategy seems to be reacting to my previous move. For example, after I chose paper (round 1), they chose scissors. After I chose rock (round 2), they chose scissors again. Then after I chose paper again (round 3), they chose paper. Then after I chose scissors (round 4), they chose scissors. After I chose rock (round 5), they chose rock. After I chose scissors (round 6), they chose paper. After I chose paper (round 7), they chose rock. \n\nSo it seems like the opponent is choosing the move that would beat my previous move. Let's check:\n\nMy previous move before their current move:\n\nRound 1: My first move was paper. They chose scissors (which beats paper).\nRound 2: My move was rock. They chose scissors (which loses to rock, but they chose scissors again. Hmm, that doesn't fit.)\nWait, maybe not. Let's see the sequence properly.\n\nWait, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: I chose paper, they chose scissors. I lost.\nRound 2: I chose rock, they chose scissors. I won.\nRound 3: I chose paper, they chose paper. Tie.\nRound 4: I chose scissors, they chose scissors. Tie.\nRound 5: I chose rock, they chose rock. Tie.\nRound 6: I chose scissors, they chose paper. I won.\nRound 7: I chose paper, they chose rock. I won.\n\nSo, after each of my moves, their next move seems to be:\n\nAfter I played paper (round 1), they played scissors (beats paper).\nAfter I played rock (round 2), they played scissors (loses to rock).\nAfter I played paper (round 3), they played paper (ties).\nAfter I played scissors (round 4), they played scissors (ties).\nAfter I played rock (round 5), they played rock (ties).\nAfter I played scissors (round 6), they played paper (beats scissors).\nAfter I played paper (round 7), they played rock (loses to paper).\n\nHmm, this is inconsistent. Sometimes they choose the move that would beat my previous move (round 1, 6), sometimes the same move (round 3,4,5), and sometimes a losing move (round 2,7). \n\nBut in the last two rounds (6 and 7), after I played scissors, they chose paper (which beats scissors), and after I played paper, they chose rock (which loses to paper). So maybe in the last two rounds, they tried to counter my previous move. \n\nIf that's the case, then in the next round, after I played paper (round 7), they might choose scissors to beat paper. So I should choose rock to beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they notice that I beat their rock with paper, they might switch to scissors to beat my paper. So I should choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll expect them to choose scissors, they might choose paper again, but that's less likely. \n\nGiven that in the last two rounds, they tried to counter my previous move (after scissors, they chose paper; after paper, they chose rock), perhaps they are following a pattern of choosing the move that beats my previous move. So if my last move was paper (round 7), they'll choose scissors next. Therefore, I should choose rock to beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they are instead cycling through their own moves, but their last move was rock, maybe they'll go to paper next. Then I should choose scissors. \n\nBut considering their recent behavior, the safer bet is to assume they'll try to counter my last move (paper) with scissors, so I should choose rock.\n",

If they were scissors, then paper, then rock, then scissors again, maybe they're following a cycle. If the last move was paper (which I beat with scissors), they might go back to rock. But in the last round, I beat their paper with scissors, so they might expect me to repeat scissors and counter with rock. Therefore, I should counter their expected rock with paper. \n\nWait, but in the previous round, when I used scissors and they used paper, they lost. They might switch to rock to beat scissors. So if I play paper, it would beat their rock. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock again and play paper to counter. This is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their responses. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been winning the last few rounds by anticipating their counters, maybe they'll try to break the cycle. But given that they've been following a pattern of reacting to my previous move, I should predict based on that. If I just played scissors and won, they might play rock next. So I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they notice that I tend to counter their expected move, they might double-bluff. But given that they're a new player, they might not be that advanced. Sticking with the basic pattern: after losing with paper, they might switch to rock. So paper would be the safe choice here.\n",

Now, they might expect me to stick with paper again, so they might switch to scissors to beat my paper. But if I anticipate that, I should play rock to beat their scissors. Wait, but they might also think I'll switch to rock and play paper instead. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me look at the history again.\n\nIn the previous rounds, after I played paper and won, they played rock again, which I beat with paper again. Then when I switched to scissors, they played paper, which I beat. Then when I played rock, they played scissors. It seems like they might be trying to counter my previous move. So if I just played paper and won, they might think I'll repeat paper, so they'll play scissors. To counter that, I should play rock. But if they catch on that I'm switching to counter their expected move, they might play paper instead. Wait, this is a cycle. Maybe I should try to detect a pattern or stick with a strategy that's less predictable. Alternatively, since they've been following a counter pattern, maybe I can double bluff. For example, if I just played paper and won, they might go scissors, so I play rock. But if they think I'll play rock, they might play paper. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their paper.

Alternatively, since they've been switching between rock, scissors, paper, maybe they'll go back to rock again. Wait, the last move they made was rock, which I beat with paper. Then I played scissors, which they countered with paper. Then I played rock, which they countered with scissors. Then I played scissors again, which they countered with paper. Then paper, which they countered with rock. So the opponent's moves have been: scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock. Hmm, not a clear pattern. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move each time. For example, when I played paper, they went scissors. Then I played rock, they went scissors. Then I played scissors, they went paper. Then I played paper, they went rock. So it seems like they are countering my last move. If that's the case, then whatever I played last, they will play the move that beats it. So if my last move was paper, they will play scissors. Therefore, I should play rock to beat their expected scissors. That makes sense. Let's go with that.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been playing scissors a lot, especially when I played rock. But in the last round, they played scissors again, and I beat them with rock. Now, they might think I'll stick with rock, so they might switch to paper to counter. But wait, maybe they expect me to switch to paper to beat their anticipated rock. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.\n\nLooking at the pattern, after I won with rock, they might try to predict my next move. If I keep using rock, they might go for paper. But if I switch to scissors, I can beat paper. Wait, no, scissors lose to rock. Let me think again. The last few moves have been a cycle: rock beats scissors, then paper beats rock, then scissors beats paper. The opponent might be trying to follow this cycle. \n\nWait, in the last round, I used rock and they used scissors. If they think I'll continue with rock, they might switch to paper. So to counter paper, I should choose scissors. But if they think I'm going to counter their paper with scissors, they might stay with rock. This is a bit of a mind game. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with scissors because they're trying to break the cycle. But that's less likely. Most players try to anticipate the counter. Let's go with paper. If they expect me to play rock again, they'll play paper, so I should play scissors. Wait, no. If they play paper, I need scissors to beat it. But if they think I'm switching from rock to paper, they might play scissors. Hmm, this is confusing. \n\nWait, the opponent's last move was scissors, which I beat with rock. They might switch to paper to beat my rock. So I should switch to scissors to beat their paper. But if they think I'm switching to scissors, they might stay with rock. I need to outguess them. Maybe the safest move is to stick with rock again, expecting them to stay with scissors. But they might have learned. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been winning by anticipating their counters, maybe they'll try to break the pattern. Let's try paper. If they think I'm going to play rock again, they'll play paper, so I play scissors. Wait, no. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they play rock, scissors lose. This is a risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors again, thinking I'll switch. So I should stay with rock. But they might have switched to paper. This is a tough call. Based on the previous pattern, they might alternate between scissors and paper. Let's go with scissors to beat paper. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with paper to cover both possibilities. If they play rock, paper wins. If they play scissors, I lose. But they just played scissors last time, so maybe they'll switch. \n\nWait, the last few moves: I played rock, they played scissors. Then I played paper, they played paper (tie). Then scissors, they played scissors (tie). Then rock, they played rock (tie). Then scissors, they played paper (I won). Then paper, they played rock (I won). Then rock, they played scissors (I won). Then scissors, they played paper (I won). Then paper, they played rock (I won). Then rock, they played scissors (I won). \n\nLooking at their moves: scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors. Wait, no, let me check the history again. The opponent's moves were: scissors (lost), scissors (tie), scissors (tie), rock (tie), paper (lost), rock (lost), scissors (lost), paper (lost), rock (lost), scissors (lost). Wait, maybe they're sticking with scissors and rock alternately. But the last few times, after I played rock, they played scissors. Then when I played paper, they played paper. Then scissors, they played scissors. Then rock, they played rock. Then scissors, they played paper. Then paper, they played rock. Then rock, they played scissors. So their moves are: scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, scissors. Hmm, it's a bit inconsistent. \n\nMaybe the opponent is trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played paper (tie). When I played scissors, they played scissors (tie). When I played rock, they played rock (tie). Then when I played scissors, they played paper (I won). When I played paper, they played rock (I won). When I played rock, they played scissors (I won). So perhaps the opponent is mirroring my previous move. If that's the case, then my last move was rock, so they might play rock again. But in the last round, I played rock and they played scissors. Wait, no. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the last round: I played rock, they played scissors. So they didn't mirror. Maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. For example, if I played rock, they might play paper next. But in the last round, after I played rock, they played scissors. That doesn't fit. Maybe they're cycling through moves. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be using a pattern like rock-paper-scissors in order. But their moves don't show a clear cycle. It's possible they're making random choices. However, given that I've been winning consistently by anticipating their counters, maybe they're trying to adjust. \n\nGiven that the last time I played rock, they played scissors. Now, if I play scissors, they might expect me to play rock again and choose paper. But if I play scissors, I can beat paper. Wait, no. Scissors lose to rock. If they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper, so I should play scissors. But if they play rock, scissors lose. Alternatively, if they think I'm switching to paper, they might play scissors. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to stick with the pattern that's been working. Since I've been countering their previous move successfully, perhaps I should predict their next move based on their last move. Their last move was scissors, so they might play rock to counter my previous rock. Wait, no. Let me check the sequence again. \n\nWait, the last round: I played rock, they played scissors. So their last move was scissors. If they follow the pattern of trying to counter my previous move, which was rock, they might play paper next. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they instead think I'll play paper to counter their expected paper, they might play scissors. This is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between scissors and rock. Their last two moves were scissors and rock. If that's the case, next might be paper. But I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to play paper. If they expect me to play rock again, they'll play paper, so I can play scissors. But I have to choose one move. Alternatively, if they play rock, paper beats it. If they play scissors, paper loses. Wait, no. Paper loses to scissors. So if I play paper, I lose if they play scissors. But their last move was scissors. Maybe they'll stick with scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost with scissors last time, they might switch to rock. If I play paper, I beat rock. But if they switch to paper, it's a tie. Hmm. \n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe I should go with the move that beats their most frequent move. Looking back, they've played scissors several times. But in recent rounds, they've been switching. Maybe they're trying to break the pattern. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been winning by countering their expected counters, perhaps I should continue that strategy. Last time I played rock, they played scissors. Now, if I play paper, expecting them to play rock again. Wait, no. If they played scissors last time, and I beat them with rock, they might switch to paper to beat rock. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. \n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to follow the cycle. Rock beats scissors, so next they might play paper. I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they play rock, scissors lose. Alternatively, if they play paper, scissors win. It's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been losing when I counter their previous move, maybe they'll try to break the cycle by playing the same move again. If they played scissors last time, they might play scissors again, so I should play rock. But they might have switched. \n\nGiven all this uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play paper. It beats rock, which they might play if they expect me to play scissors. Alternatively, if they play scissors again, I lose. But given that they just lost with scissors, they might switch. \n\nWait, the last time they played scissors, I beat them with rock. Then they played scissors again, and I played rock again, which tied. Then they played paper, which I beat with scissors. Then they played rock, which I beat with paper. Then scissors again, which I beat with rock. So their moves have been scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors. It seems like they might be cycling through. If the pattern is scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, then next might be paper again. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to play the move that would have beaten my last move. My last move was rock, so they might play paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nI think I'll go with scissors, expecting them to play paper. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if they play rock, I lose. It's a risk. \n\nWait, another approach: since the opponent has been losing when they try to counter my previous move, maybe they'll start randomizing. In that case, there's no pattern, and I should play randomly. But since I'm trying to maximize points, maybe I should stick with a move that has been successful. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been winning with rock, paper, scissors in a cycle, maybe I should continue that cycle. Last move was rock, so next is paper. But that might be predictable. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's just go with scissors, hoping they play paper. \n\n[move] (Anticipating opponent to switch to paper) scissors\n",

The last move they made was paper, which I beat with scissors. Now, in the next round, I need to predict what they'll do.\n\nIf they were using scissors last time and I countered with rock, they might expect me to play rock again. So maybe they'll switch to paper to beat my rock. But wait, the last round they played paper, and I used scissors. If they think I'll stick with scissors, they might go for rock to beat my scissors. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Let's look at the history. The last few moves from the opponent were scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper. Wait, no, let me check again. The last few results: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost). Then I played rock, they played scissors (I won). Then I played paper, they played paper (tie). Then scissors, they played scissors (tie). Then rock, they played rock (tie). Then scissors, they played paper (I won). Then paper, they played rock (I won). Then rock, they played scissors (I won). Then scissors, they played paper (I won). Then paper, they played rock (I won). Then rock, they played scissors (I won). Then scissors, they played paper (I won). \n\nWait, the opponent's recent moves after the last corrections: they played paper when I played scissors, then rock when I played paper, then scissors when I played rock, then paper again. It seems like they might be trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played scissors, they played rock (but in one case, they played paper). Hmm, maybe they're following a pattern of countering my last move. If that's the case, then if I last played scissors, they might play rock next. So to counter that, I should play paper. But wait, in the last round, I played scissors and they played paper, which I beat. Now, if they expect me to play scissors again, they might play rock, so I should play paper. But I need to check the latest move.\n\nWait, the last move I made was scissors, and they played paper. So if they think I'll repeat scissors, they might play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat their expected rock. Alternatively, if they're alternating, maybe they'll switch back to scissors. But given the recent pattern, they might be trying to counter my previous move. So if I last played scissors, they might play rock. Therefore, I should play paper. Let me confirm the last few moves:\n\n- I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n- Then I played paper, they played rock (I won).\n- Then I played rock, they played scissors (I won).\n- Then I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n- Then I played paper, they played rock (I won).\n- Then I played rock, they played scissors (I won).\n- Then I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n\nSo the opponent's moves after my scissors were paper, then after my paper was rock, after my rock was scissors, and so on. It seems like they are consistently playing the move that would beat my previous move. For example, after I play scissors (which beats paper), they play rock (which beats scissors). Then I play paper (beats rock), they play scissors (beats paper). Then I play rock (beats scissors), they play paper (beats rock). Wait, no, that's not exactly consistent. Let me map it out:\n\nMy move -> Their move:\nscissors -> paper (I won)\npaper -> rock (I won)\nrock -> scissors (I won)\nscissors -> paper (I won)\npaper -> rock (I won)\nrock -> scissors (I won)\nscissors -> paper (I won)\n\nWait, this pattern shows that when I play scissors, they play paper; when I play paper, they play rock; when I play rock, they play scissors. So they are actually playing the move that my previous move beats. For example, scissors beats paper, so if I play scissors, they play paper. Paper beats rock, so if I play paper, they play rock. Rock beats scissors, so if I play rock, they play scissors. This is a losing strategy for them because they're always playing the move that I can beat. But maybe they're stuck in this pattern. If that's the case, then my next move should be whatever beats the move that my previous move beats. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf my last move was scissors, which beats paper, and they played paper, then next, if I play paper (which beats rock), they would play rock. Then if I play rock (beats scissors), they play scissors. So the pattern is that they are always playing the move that my previous move beats. Therefore, to counter this, I should play the move that beats the move they will choose based on my last move. Since my last move was scissors, they will play paper again. Wait, no, because in the last round, I played scissors, they played paper. If the pattern is that they play the move that my previous move beats, then regardless of what I do next, they will play the move that my last move beats. So if I just played scissors, they will play paper again. Therefore, I should play scissors again to beat their paper. But in the last round, I did play scissors and they played paper, so I won. If I play scissors again, they might play paper again, leading to another win. But maybe they will catch on and change their strategy. However, based on the history, they keep following this pattern. So if I keep playing the same move, I can keep winning. But the problem is that if they realize this, they might switch. But according to the given history, they haven't switched yet. So maybe I should continue exploiting this pattern. However, in the last round, I played scissors, they played paper, I won. If I play scissors again, they might play paper again, so I win. But perhaps they will adjust. Alternatively, if they think I will repeat, they might play rock to beat my scissors. So I need to anticipate that. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. But how to decide?\n\nLooking at the history, every time I play a move, they play the move that my previous move beats. So if I just played scissors, they play paper. If I play paper, they play rock. If I play rock, they play scissors. Therefore, the pattern is that their move is my previous move's beaten move. Therefore, to counter this, I can cycle through the moves that beat their expected move. For example, if I just played scissors (beats paper), they will play paper. So I should play scissors again to beat their expected paper. But if they continue this pattern, I can keep winning by repeating. However, if they break the pattern, I might lose. But given that they haven't broken it yet, maybe it's safe to continue. Alternatively, if I switch, I can continue the cycle. For example, after scissors (beats paper), they play paper. Then I play scissors again, they play paper again. But maybe they will eventually switch. Alternatively, if I play paper next, they will play rock (since my previous move was scissors, which beats paper, so they play paper. Wait, no, the pattern is that their move is the one that my previous move beats. So if I played scissors (beats paper), they play paper. Then if I play paper (beats rock), they play rock. Then if I play rock (beats scissors), they play scissors. Then scissors (beats paper), they play paper. So the cycle is scissors -> paper -> rock -> scissors -> paper -> rock, etc. So if I follow this cycle, I can keep winning. But in the actual game history, after I played scissors and they played paper, I then played paper, they played rock, then I played rock, they played scissors, then scissors, they played paper, etc. So the pattern holds. Therefore, to continue winning, I should play the move that beats their expected move, which is based on my previous move. So if my last move was scissors, they will play paper, so I should play scissors again. But in the last round, I played scissors, they played paper, I won. If I play scissors again, they might play paper again, leading to another win. However, if they catch on and decide to counter my scissors by playing rock, then I would lose. But according to the history, they haven't done that yet. So perhaps it's safe to continue. Alternatively, to avoid being predictable, I can switch. But given that the opponent is following this pattern, maybe it's better to exploit it. \n\nWait, but in the last few rounds, every time I play a move, they play the move that my previous move beats. So the strategy is to play the same move again, expecting them to play the same counter. For example, if I play scissors, they play paper. If I play scissors again, they play paper again, and I win again. But if they start adjusting, this could backfire. However, since they haven't adjusted yet, maybe I should keep doing it. Alternatively, if I switch to paper, they will play rock, which I can beat with paper. Wait, no, if I switch to paper, then according to the pattern, they will play rock (since my previous move was scissors, which beats paper, so they play paper. Wait, no, the pattern is that their move is the one that my previous move beats. So if my previous move was scissors (beats paper), their move is paper. Then if I play paper next, their move will be rock (since paper beats rock). Then if I play rock, their move is scissors. So the cycle continues. Therefore, to maximize points, I should follow the cycle: scissors -> paper -> rock -> scissors, etc. But in the last round, I played scissors, they played paper. Now, if I play scissors again, they might play paper again. But if they do, I win again. However, if they switch to rock, I lose. But given the history, they haven't switched yet. So perhaps it's better to continue the cycle. Alternatively, if I play paper now, expecting them to play rock (since my last move was scissors, which beats paper, so they play paper. Wait, no, the pattern is that their move is the one that my previous move beats. So if I played scissors last time (beats paper), they play paper. Then if I play paper next, they will play rock (since paper beats rock). Then I can play paper again to beat their rock. Wait, but according to the pattern, after I play paper, they play rock. So I should play paper to beat their rock. But in the current scenario, my last move was scissors, so they are expected to play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors again to beat their paper. But if they continue the pattern, that's a win. However, if they break the pattern and play rock, I lose. But since they haven't broken it yet, maybe it's safe. Alternatively, maybe they are starting to adapt. Let me check the latest moves again. The last few rounds:\n\n1. I played paper, they played scissors (I lost).\n2. I played rock, they played scissors (I won).\n3. I played paper, they played paper (tie).\n4. I played scissors, they played scissors (tie).\n5. I played rock, they played rock (tie).\n6. I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n7. I played paper, they played rock (I won).\n8. I played rock, they played scissors (I won).\n9. I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n10. I played paper, they played rock (I won).\n11. I played rock, they played scissors (I won).\n12. I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n13. I played paper, they played rock (I won).\n14. I played rock, they played scissors (I won).\n15. I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n\nWait, after the initial rounds where there were some ties and losses, the opponent started following the pattern where their move is the one that my previous move beats. So from move 6 onwards, every time I play a move, they play the move that my previous move beats. For example:\n\n- I played scissors (beats paper), they played paper.\n- Then I played paper (beats rock), they played rock.\n- Then I played rock (beats scissors), they played scissors.\n- Then I played scissors (beats paper), they played paper.\n- And so on.\n\nSo the pattern is clear: they are always responding with the move that my previous move beats. Therefore, to continue winning, I just need to play the same move again, because they will keep playing the same counter. For example, if I played scissors and they played paper, then if I play scissors again, they will play paper again, and I win again. But wait, according to the pattern, their next move is determined by my previous move. So if I just played scissors, they will play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors again to beat their paper. However, if I keep playing scissors, they might eventually catch on and play rock. But according to the history, they haven't done that yet. So perhaps it's safe to continue. Alternatively, if I follow the cycle, I can keep rotating through scissors, paper, rock, etc., each time beating their expected move. For example:\n\n- Play scissors, they play paper (win).\n- Play paper, they play rock (win).\n- Play rock, they play scissors (win).\n- Repeat.\n\nThis way, I cycle through the moves, and they keep playing the move that my previous move beats, allowing me to win each time. So the next move after scissors would be paper, then rock, then scissors again. But in the last round, I played scissors, they played paper. So according to the cycle, I should now play paper, expecting them to play rock. Then play rock, expecting them to play scissors, and so on. However, in the actual game history, after I played scissors and they played paper, I then played paper, they played rock (I won), then rock, they played scissors (I won), then scissors, they played paper (I won), etc. So following this cycle works. Therefore, the next move should be paper, as the cycle would dictate. Wait, but the last move I made was scissors, and they played paper. So according to the cycle, the next move should be paper to beat their expected rock. Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIf I play scissors, they play paper (I win).\nThen I play paper, they play rock (I win).\nThen I play rock, they play scissors (I win).\nThen I play scissors again, they play paper again (I win).\nSo the cycle is scissors -> paper -> rock -> scissors -> paper -> rock, etc.\n\nBut in the game history, after scissors (win), I played paper (win), then rock (win), then scissors (win), etc. So the cycle is working. Therefore, the next move after scissors should be paper. But according to the last move, I played scissors, they played paper. So the next move in the cycle is paper. Therefore, I should play paper now, expecting them to play rock. Then I play paper, which beats rock. But wait, according to the pattern, when I play paper, they play rock. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the next move should be paper. But in the last round, I played scissors, they played paper. So following the cycle, I should now play paper. However, in the previous cycle, after scissors, I played paper. Let me check:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Round 6: I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n- Round 7: I played paper, they played rock (I won).\n- Round 8: I played rock, they played scissors (I won).\n- Round 9: I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n- Round 10: I played paper, they played rock (I won).\n- Round 11: I played rock, they played scissors (I won).\n- Round 12: I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n- Round 13: I played paper, they played rock (I won).\n- Round 14: I played rock, they played scissors (I won).\n- Round 15: I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n\nSo the cycle is scissors -> paper -> rock -> scissors -> paper -> rock, etc. Therefore, after scissors, the next move is paper. Then after paper, rock. Then after rock, scissors. So in the current situation, the last move was scissors, so the next move should be paper. Therefore, I should play paper now, expecting them to play rock, which I can beat. But wait, according to the pattern, when I play paper, they play rock. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the correct move is paper. But in the last round, I played scissors, they played paper. So next, I play paper, they play rock, I win. Then I play rock, they play scissors, I win. So the cycle continues. Therefore, the next move should be paper.\n",

Let me look at the pattern of their moves.\n\nLooking back, the opponent's moves have been scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. It seems like they're cycling through the moves, possibly trying to counter my previous choices. After I played paper and they lost with rock, they might expect me to repeat paper, so they might choose scissors. If I choose rock this time, I can beat their scissors. But wait, if they think I'm going to counter their expected scissors with rock, they might stay with paper to beat my rock. This is a common rock-paper-scissors mind game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking to a pattern. Let's see: after losing with rock, they might switch to paper next. If they choose paper, then I should choose scissors. But I need to consider their possible strategies. Since they've been following a cycle before, maybe they'll continue. Let me check the last few moves. The last few opponent moves were rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. It's a bit inconsistent, but there's a pattern of switching to beat the previous move. For example, after I played scissors and they lost with paper, they switched to rock. Then when I played paper, they used rock again and lost, so maybe they'll switch to paper next. If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. But if they think I'm going to choose scissors, they might choose rock. This is a loop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to break the cycle. Since they lost with rock against my paper, they might go back to scissors to beat paper again. But I just beat their rock with paper, so if they go back to scissors, I should play rock. Wait, but if I play rock and they play scissors, I win. If they play paper, I lose. It's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe they'll stick with rock again, thinking I might switch to scissors. But that's less likely. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to continue the cycle. If they were on rock last time and lost, they might switch to paper. So I should choose scissors. But I need to make sure. Let me think again. If they lost with rock, they might think I'll stay on paper, so they go scissors. If I switch to rock, I beat their scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might stay on paper. This is a classic RPS dilemma. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they mirror my last move. For example, if I played paper, they might play paper next. But in the last round, I played paper and they played rock, so that doesn't fit. Hmm. \n\nAnother approach: since I've been winning several times by anticipating their counters, maybe they'll try to break the pattern. If I keep switching to beat their expected move, maybe I should go with paper again. But that's risky if they choose scissors. \n\nWait, looking at the history: when I played paper, they played rock (I won). Then I played scissors, they played paper (I won). Then I played rock, they played scissors (I won). Then scissors again, they played paper (I won). Then paper, they played rock (I won). Then rock, they played scissors (I won). Then scissors, they played paper (I won). Then paper, they played rock (I won). So the opponent seems to be consistently choosing the move that would have lost to my previous move. For example, after I played paper, they played rock (which loses to paper). Then I played scissors, they played paper (loses to scissors). Then I played rock, they played scissors (loses to rock). So it seems like the opponent is always choosing the move that my previous move beats. Therefore, if I played paper last time, they will choose rock again. If that's the case, I should play paper again to beat their expected rock. But wait, in the last round, I played paper and they chose rock, so if they keep doing that, I can keep playing paper. But maybe they'll realize this and switch. However, based on the pattern, they haven't adjusted yet. So maybe sticking with paper is safe. But if they do switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if they continue the pattern, they'll choose rock again, so paper is safe. But after several losses, they might change. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is stuck in a loop of choosing the move that my previous move beats. If that's the case, then my next move should be the same as my last move, which was paper. But if they switch, I need to adjust. However, given the pattern, it's likely they'll continue choosing the losing move. Therefore, I should play paper again. But I need to confirm. Let me check the last few rounds:\n\n- I played paper, opponent rock (win)\n- I played scissors, opponent paper (win)\n- I played rock, opponent scissors (win)\n- I played scissors, opponent paper (win)\n- I played paper, opponent rock (win)\n- I played rock, opponent scissors (win)\n- I played scissors, opponent paper (win)\n- I played paper, opponent rock (win)\n\nSo every time, the opponent is choosing the move that my previous move beats. Therefore, if I played paper last time, they will choose rock again. Therefore, I should play paper again. But if they break the pattern and choose scissors, I lose. However, since they haven't broken the pattern yet, it's safer to assume they'll continue. Therefore, the best move is paper.\n",

The last few rounds: when I played paper, they played scissors. Before that, when I played scissors, they played paper. It seems like they're countering my previous move.

Wait, no, the last few moves were: when I played rock, they played scissors; then I played scissors, they played paper; then I played paper, they played scissors. So their moves were scissors, paper, scissors. Hmm, maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper. If that's the case, next they might play rock.

But they just played scissors, so maybe they'll stick with it. But that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern of their own.

The last two times I chose paper, they picked scissors, so I lost. Maybe they're expecting me to stick with paper again, so they might go for scissors once more. If I switch to rock, that would beat scissors. But wait, if they think I'll switch to rock, maybe they'll choose paper instead. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern. Let me look back at the history. The last few moves: I played paper twice, they played scissors both times. Before that, when I played scissors, they played paper. So when I play scissors, they play paper; when I play paper, they play scissors. It seems like they're countering my previous move. If that's the case, if I play rock next, they might expect me to follow the cycle and play paper, so they might choose scissors again. But rock beats scissors. Wait, if they think I'll play paper again, they might go scissors, so I should play rock.

Wait, but they just played scissors twice. Maybe they're sticking with scissors. If I play rock now, I can beat scissors. But I need to predict their next move based on my previous moves and their responses. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they counter the move that would beat my last move. For example, when I played paper, which is beaten by scissors, they played scissors. So if I played paper, they play scissors. If I played scissors, they play rock? Wait, no. When I played scissors before, they played paper. Wait, scissors beats paper, so if I play scissors, they play paper, which I beat. But in the last round, when I played paper, they played scissors, which beats paper. So their strategy seems to be to counter my last move. So if I play paper, they play scissors. If I play scissors, they play rock. If I play rock, they play paper. Wait, that's a cycle. So if I can predict that they're always countering my last move, I can choose the move that beats their expected counter. \n\nFor example, if I just played paper, they'll play scissors.

If I now play rock, expecting them to play scissors again, but maybe they'll change their strategy. Wait, but they might notice that I'm adapting. Alternatively, maybe they have a fixed pattern. Let me test this. If I play rock now, and they play scissors again, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given that they've been countering my last move, maybe they'll continue. So if I played paper last, they play scissors. If I now play rock, which beats scissors, I can win. Let's try that.\n",

Wait, but I just played rock and they played scissors. If they switch to rock, I need paper. But if they think I'll stay with rock, they might play paper.

They played scissors three times in a row (rounds 13, 14, 15). Then after I played rock and won, they might switch. But in round 15, they played scissors again. So maybe they're sticking with scissors. If they keep playing scissors, I should play rock again. But they might have noticed that I played rock twice in a row (rounds 2 and 15).

The last two moves were paper (tie) and scissors (they lost). Wait, no, the last move was paper (tie). Before that, they played scissors (I won with rock). Then before that, scissors (they won). So their recent moves: scissors (they won), scissors (I won), paper (tie). Hmm, not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to play the move that beats my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors. When I played rock, they played scissors. When I played scissors, they played paper. So perhaps their strategy is to play the move that beats my last move. If that's the case, then since my last move was paper, they will play scissors. Therefore, I should play rock to beat scissors. But in the last round, when I played paper, they played paper (tie), which contradicts that pattern. So maybe they changed their strategy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after a tie, they decide to stick with the same move. So if they played paper last time and tied, they might play paper again. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they switch, then scissors might lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll play scissors to beat their paper, they might play rock. So I should play paper again. But this is a lot of second-guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to play randomly, but given the history, the opponent seems to have a tendency to play scissors and paper more often. So perhaps playing rock would be safer, as it beats scissors and ties with rock. But in the last few rounds, they played paper twice (tie and loss). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the opponent has played paper twice in a row (the last two moves: paper (tie) and before that, scissors (they lost)). Wait, no, the last move was paper (tie), before that they played scissors (I won with rock), then scissors (they won), then paper (I won with scissors), etc. So their recent moves are scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, paper. It seems like they alternate between scissors and paper, but the last two were paper. Maybe they are sticking with paper now. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they switch to rock, scissors loses. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, scissors wins. But given that they tied with paper last time, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. But it's uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to counter my expected move. Since I've been cycling through rock, paper, scissors, maybe they expect me to play scissors next (since last was paper). So they might play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat rock. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, given that the last two times I played paper, they played scissors and then paper. So after a tie, maybe they'll go back to scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they play paper again, rock loses. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the best approach is to play the move that beats their most frequent recent move. Looking at their last three moves: paper, scissors, paper. So paper and scissors are common. Rock hasn't been played as much. So maybe play rock to beat scissors, but if they play paper, rock loses. Alternatively, play scissors to beat paper. But if they play scissors, scissors ties. Alternatively, play paper to tie or beat rock. But they haven't played rock recently.\n\nAlternatively, since they tied with paper last time, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat rock. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, use a counter to their expected counter. If they think I'll play scissors to beat their paper, they play rock. So I play paper to beat rock. But this is a meta-level strategy.\n\nGiven all this uncertainty, maybe the safest move is to play scissors, expecting them to play paper again. But in the last round, they played paper and tied, so they might switch. Alternatively, play rock to beat scissors if they switch. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, stick with paper again, but that led to a tie last time.\n\nWait, the last time I played paper, they played paper (tie). If I play scissors now, and they play paper again, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie. But given their history, they might switch to scissors after a tie. So scissors vs scissors is a tie, which isn't great. Alternatively, if I play rock, and they switch to scissors, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. If they stay with paper, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering that after a tie, they might expect me to change my move. So if I played paper last time and tied, they might think I'll switch to scissors. So they play rock to beat scissors. Therefore, I should play paper to beat rock. That could work. So the move would be paper.\n\nBut in the previous round, when I played paper and they tied, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they play rock. So I play paper to beat rock. That's a possible line of reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stick with paper again, they might play scissors. So I should play rock. But this is conflicting.\n\nThis is really a game of predicting the opponent's prediction. Given that, perhaps the best approach is to cycle through the moves in a non-patterned way. But since I've been following a cycle (rock, paper, scissors), maybe the opponent has caught on. If my last move was paper, the next in the cycle would be scissors. So they might expect scissors and play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat rock. But this is assuming they know my cycle.\n\nAlternatively, break the cycle. If I was cycling rock, paper, scissors, and last was paper, the next would be scissors. But instead, I play rock to break the cycle. If they expect scissors and play rock, I play paper. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the opponent's possible reactions and trying to anticipate their move, the best guess is that they might expect me to switch to scissors after paper, so they play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat rock. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, it's a tie again. But given that they tied last time, they might switch. So playing paper could either tie or win, depending on their move. Alternatively, playing scissors could beat paper if they stay, but lose to rock if they switch. Rock could beat scissors if they switch, but lose to paper if they stay. It's a gamble.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. But given that they tied with paper, they might switch. Alternatively, play rock to counter a possible switch to scissors. But without a clear pattern, it's hard to decide. \n\nWait, looking back, after a tie, the opponent sometimes repeated the move. For example, after a tie with paper, they might play paper again. If I play scissors, I win. But in the previous tie (round 3), after a tie with paper, they played scissors next. Wait, no, let me check the history again.\n\nLooking back at the rounds:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent scissors (I lost)\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent scissors (I won)\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent paper (tie)\nRound 4: I played scissors, opponent scissors (tie)\nRound 5: I played rock, opponent rock (tie)\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent paper (I won)\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent rock (I won)\nRound 8: I played rock, opponent scissors (I won)\nRound 9: I played scissors, opponent paper (I won)\nRound 10: I played paper, opponent rock (I won)\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent scissors (I won)\nRound 12: I played scissors, opponent paper (I won)\nRound 13: I played paper, opponent scissors (I lost)\nRound 14: I played rock, opponent scissors (I won)\nRound 15: I played paper, opponent paper (tie)\nRound 16: I played paper, opponent scissors (I lost)\nRound 17: I played rock, opponent scissors (I won)\nRound 18: I played paper, opponent paper (tie)\n\nSo after the first tie in round 3 (both paper), the opponent next played scissors in round 4. Then after another tie in round 4 (both scissors), the opponent played rock in round 5. Then after a tie in round 5 (both rock), the opponent played paper in round 6. So after a tie, the opponent tends to switch to the next move in the cycle. So after paper tie, they played scissors. After scissors tie, they played rock. After rock tie, they played paper. So following that pattern, after the latest paper tie (round 18), they might switch to scissors again. Therefore, I should play rock to beat scissors.\n",

I just beat their scissors with rock, so maybe they'll expect me to play rock again. If they think I'll stick with rock, they might switch to paper to counter it. But wait, they might also try to outsmart me by staying with scissors if they think I'll switch to paper. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the pattern, after I won with rock, they might anticipate that I'll go for paper next. So if they go for scissors to beat paper, I should play rock again. But if they think I'm going to repeat rock, they might go paper. This is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should mix it up. Since they've been using scissors multiple times, perhaps they have a tendency to stick with it. But after losing to rock, they might switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a cycle. Let's recap the recent moves: I played rock and won against their scissors. Then I played paper, which tied. Then rock again, which won. So they might be alternating between scissors and paper. If that's the case, next they might play rock. Wait, no, the last move they made was scissors, which I beat with rock. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. But if they stay with scissors, I should play rock again. \n\nBut since I just played rock and won, they might expect me to play paper next. If they switch to scissors to beat paper, then I should play rock. But if they think I'm going to play rock again, they might go paper. It's a bit of a guessing game. Maybe the best approach is to counter their most likely move. Since they've been using scissors a lot, but just lost to rock, they might switch to paper. If that's the case, I should play scissors. But I need to balance between predicting their next move and not being too predictable myself. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to follow a pattern where they switch to the move that beats my previous move. For example, if I played rock last time, they might play paper next. If that's the case, I should play scissors. But I'm not sure. Let's take a risk and assume they'll switch to paper. So I'll play scissors. Wait, but if they stick with scissors again, scissors ties with scissors. Hmm. Maybe I should go with paper to beat their possible rock. But they just played scissors, so rock would beat scissors again. This is confusing. \n\nWait, the last few moves: I played rock and won, then paper (tie), then rock (win), then paper (tie), then rock (win). They played scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors. Wait, no, looking back:\n\n- When I played paper, they played paper (tie).\n- Then scissors, they played scissors (tie).\n- Then rock, they played scissors (I won).\n- Then paper, they played scissors (I lost).\n- Then rock, they played scissors (I won).\n- Then paper, they played scissors (I lost).\n- Then rock, they played scissors (I won).\n- Then paper, they played scissors (I lost).\n- Then rock, they played scissors (I won).\n- Then paper, they played scissors (I lost).\n- Then rock, they played scissors (I won).\n\nWait, the opponent seems to be sticking with scissors a lot, especially after I play rock. But sometimes they switch to paper. Maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper. If the last move was scissors, maybe they'll switch to paper. But in the last round, I played rock and they played scissors again. So maybe they're sticking with scissors. If that's the case, I should play rock again. But they might expect that and switch to paper. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of scissors, paper, scissors, paper. If that's the case, after scissors, they'll play paper. So I should play scissors. But I need to check the history. Let me try to track the opponent's moves:\n\n1. Opponent: scissors (I played paper, lost)\n2. Opponent: scissors (I played rock, won)\n3. Opponent: paper (I played paper, tie)\n4. Opponent: scissors (I played scissors, tie)\n5. Opponent: scissors (I played rock, won)\n6. Opponent: scissors (I played paper, lost)\n7. Opponent: scissors (I played rock, won)\n8. Opponent: scissors (I played paper, lost)\n9. Opponent: scissors (I played rock, won)\n10. Opponent: scissors (I played paper, lost)\n11. Opponent: scissors (I played rock, won)\n\nWait, actually, the opponent has been playing scissors almost every time except when they played paper once. So they seem to favor scissors. If that's the case, playing rock again would beat scissors. But they might catch on and switch to paper. However, given their tendency to stick with scissors, maybe it's safer to play rock again. But I have to consider that they might adapt. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been alternating between rock and paper, maybe they expect me to switch to scissors next. If I play scissors, and they play scissors, it's a tie. If they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. But given their history, they might stick with scissors. So playing scissors would tie. But I want to win. So maybe rock is still the safer choice. \n\nBut if they expect me to play rock again, they'll play paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they stick with scissors, I lose. It's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe they're not adapting and keep choosing scissors. In that case, rock is the best. \n\nGiven the opponent's strong tendency to choose scissors, even after multiple losses, I'll go with rock again. But wait, in the last round, I played rock and they played scissors again. So maybe they're not adapting. Let's try rock once more.\n",
