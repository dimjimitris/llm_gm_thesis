The user's previous response had the [move] tag, an explanation, and then the move on a new line. The system probably wants the entire move message in one line without any line breaks. So the correction is to make sure that the move is on the same line as the [move] tag and the explanation, without any markdown or nested parentheses.\n\nSo the correct format should be: [move] (Explanation here) paper. All in one line. The user's previous response had the move on a separate line, which might have caused the error. Now, the assistant needs to resend the move in the correct format without indicating that there was a correction. Therefore, the move should be \"paper\" again, but formatted properly this time.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I just won the first round by choosing paper against their rock. Now I need to decide my next move. The opponent is a new player, so maybe they'll adjust their strategy after losing. Let me think.\n\nIn the first round, they chose rock, which is a common first move. Since I beat them with paper, they might expect me to stick with paper again. If they think that, they might switch to scissors to beat my paper. But wait, if I anticipate that, I should choose rock to beat their scissors. Alternatively, they might stick with rock again, thinking I might switch to scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to paper themselves to counter a possible rock from me. If I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But I need to consider the possible patterns here. New players sometimes repeat their moves or switch predictably. Since they lost with rock, they might try a different move. Let's break down the possibilities:\n\nIf they played rock first and lost, possible next moves:\n- Rock again: hoping I switch to scissors. If I choose paper again, I win. If I choose scissors, they win.\n- Switch to paper: expecting me to stay with paper, so they choose scissors. Wait, no. If they think I'll stay with paper, they'd choose scissors. But if they switch to paper, it's a tie. If they switch to scissors, they beat my paper.\n\nBut since I won with paper, they might think I'll either repeat paper or switch. If they go scissors, then I should choose rock. If they go paper, I should choose scissors. If they stay with rock, I can choose paper again.\n\nBut maybe they'll think I expect them to switch to scissors, so they might choose paper instead. This is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to simplify. Since they're new, they might not be overcomplicating. After losing with rock, they might switch to paper or scissors. Let's look at the possible outcomes:\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- Beats scissors, loses to paper, ties with rock.\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- Beats rock, loses to scissors, ties with paper.\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- Beats paper, loses to rock, ties with scissors.\n\nIn the first round, they chose rock. If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. If they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. If they stay with rock, I should choose paper again. But how likely are they to switch? New players might either stick with the same move (thinking it's just bad luck) or switch to the move that beats the last winning move. Since paper beat their rock, they might choose scissors next to counter paper. So if I think they'll choose scissors, I should go with rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll stay with paper, they choose scissors, so I should choose rock. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might stay with rock, leading to a tie. This is a bit of a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to mirror my previous move. Since I used paper, they might use paper next, leading to a tie. But I don't know. Another angle: the points. When I beat their rock with paper, I got 3 points. If they choose scissors and I choose rock, I get 1 point. If they choose paper and I choose scissors, I get 1 point. If they choose rock again and I choose paper, I get 3 again. So maybe going for paper again is higher reward if they repeat rock. But if they switch to scissors, I lose 1. Hmm. Risk vs reward.\n\nGiven that they're new, maybe they'll switch to scissors to try to beat my previous paper. So I should counter with rock. But if they think that, they might go paper. Alternatively, they might not think that deeply and just randomly switch. It's hard to predict. Maybe the safest move is to switch to rock, expecting them to go scissors. Alternatively, stick with paper if they repeat. But since they lost once, they might not repeat. I'll go with rock this time to counter their possible scissors.\n",

Alternatively, if they think I'll stay on rock, they might choose paper. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to consider that they might try to predict my pattern.

But they might not do that. \n\nWait, maybe they're following a pattern of their own. They played rock, then scissors. If they're going in reverse order (rock, scissors, paper), next would be paper. But that's just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my last move. My last move was rock, which beats scissors. So they might think I'll play rock again, so they play paper. If they play paper, I should play scissors. \n\nBut if they think I'm going to switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors to beat paper. Then I should play rock again. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Since they've lost twice, they might be more cautious. Maybe they'll switch to paper to beat my previous rock. So I should play scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with scissors again, thinking I'll switch to paper.

Then I went with scissors, predicting they'd go to paper, which worked again. So each time, they seem to be shifting to the move that would beat my previous move.

Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move each time. After I used paper, they went rock (lost), then scissors (lost to my rock), then paper (lost to my scissors). Wait, that's not a consistent pattern. Let me list their moves:\n\nOpponent's moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. So they cycled through rock, scissors, paper. That's the standard order. Maybe they're cycling through the moves in order. If that's the case, after paper, the next would be rock again. So if they follow rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, etc., then next would be rock.\n\nBut wait, their first move was rock, then scissors, then paper. So the sequence is rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock... So next would be rock. If that's the case, I should choose paper again to beat rock. But maybe they'll notice the pattern and change. Alternatively, they might think I expect them to cycle and try to counter that.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost three times, they might try to break the cycle. Maybe they'll stick with the same move, hoping I change. For example, if they used paper last time and lost, maybe they'll switch to rock to beat scissors, thinking I'll expect them to cycle. But I need to predict based on their possible reactions.\n\nAnother angle: the opponent is a new player. New players often start with rock, then maybe switch to what would beat the last move. Since I beat their rock with paper, they might switch to scissors. Then when I used rock, they might have thought I was alternating, so they went scissors. Then when I used scissors, they went paper. Now, after three losses, they might try to counter my last move. My last move was scissors, so they might choose rock to beat scissors. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat their expected rock.\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'm cycling through moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper... So next I would choose paper again. If they expect that, they might choose scissors. But then I should choose rock to beat scissors. Wait, but that's getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to mirror my previous move. For example, after I used scissors, they might use scissors next. But that's not likely since they lost with paper last time. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, they might be using a \"losing strategy\" where they follow the move that would have lost to my previous move. For example, after I played paper, they played rock (which loses to paper). Then after I played rock, they played scissors (loses to rock). Then after scissors, they played paper (loses to scissors). So each time, they're choosing the move that my previous move beats. If that's the case, then my next move should be whatever beats the move that my last move (scissors) beats. Since scissors beats paper, they might choose paper again, so I should choose scissors again. But wait, that's what happened last time. If they keep doing that, then scissors would beat their paper again. But maybe they'll break the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, if they keep choosing the move that my previous move beats, then my next move should be the same as my previous move. Because if I used scissors last time, which beats paper, they might choose paper again, so scissors would still win. But if they realize that, they might switch to rock to beat scissors. So maybe I should switch to paper to beat their potential rock.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to simplify. The opponent's moves so far: rock, scissors, paper. If they're cycling through the moves in reverse order (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock...), then next is rock. So I should choose paper. But if they're cycling in the standard order (rock, paper, scissors), but they went rock, scissors, paper, that's not the standard order. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move each time. For example:\n\n- I chose paper, they chose rock (paper beats rock)\n- I chose rock, they chose scissors (rock beats scissors)\n- I chose scissors, they chose paper (scissors beats paper)\n\nSo each time, they chose the move that my previous move beats. So if I keep choosing the move that beats their previous choice, which is the move that my previous move beats, then they might continue this pattern. So next, they would choose the move that my last move (scissors) beats, which is paper. So if they choose paper again, I should choose scissors again. But if they realize that I'm repeating, they might switch to rock. Alternatively, if they keep following the pattern, they'll choose paper again, so scissors would work. But since they lost three times, maybe they'll change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll start choosing randomly. But as a new player, they might not. Alternatively, they might think that since I've beaten them three times with paper, rock, scissors, I'm cycling through, so next I'll choose paper again. So they might choose scissors to beat paper. Then I should choose rock to beat scissors.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. The safest bet might be to assume they continue the pattern of choosing the move that my previous move beats. Since my last move was scissors (beats paper), they'll choose paper again. So I should choose scissors again. But if they think I'll repeat, they might choose rock. So maybe I should switch to paper to beat rock.\n\nAlternatively, since they've lost three times, they might try to break the pattern. Maybe they'll go back to rock, thinking I expect them to follow the previous pattern. So if they choose rock, I should choose paper.\n\nAlternatively, they might try to counter my last move. My last move was scissors, so they might choose rock. So I should choose paper.\n\nHmm. There's a few possibilities here. The key is to predict their next move based on their past behavior. Given that they've followed the pattern of choosing the move that my previous move beats, then next they'll choose paper again (since I last chose scissors). So scissors would beat paper again. But if they notice that I've used scissors twice in a row (last two moves: rock, scissors, scissors?), wait no, my moves were paper, rock, scissors. So last move was scissors. If they follow the pattern, they choose paper again. So scissors would work. But if they think I'll repeat scissors, they might choose rock. So maybe I should switch to paper.\n\nAlternatively, since they've lost three times, they might start choosing randomly. But as a new player, they might not. They might stick to a pattern. Let's go with the assumption that they continue the pattern. So scissors again. But that's risky. Alternatively, if they choose rock, paper beats it. If they choose scissors, rock beats it. If they choose paper, scissors beats it. So maybe the safest move is rock, which beats scissors. But why?\n\nWait, let's think about possible opponent moves:\n\n- If they choose rock: paper beats it (3 points)\n- If they choose paper: scissors beats it (1 point)\n- If they choose scissors: rock beats it (1 point)\n\nSo if I choose paper, I get 3 points if they choose rock, lose 3 if they choose paper, and lose 1 if they choose scissors. If I choose scissors, I get 1 point if they choose paper, lose 1 if they choose scissors, lose 3 if they choose rock. If I choose rock, I get 1 point if they choose scissors, lose 1 if they choose rock, lose 3 if they choose paper.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best is to predict their next move and choose accordingly. If I think they'll choose rock, then paper. If they choose paper, scissors. If scissors, rock.\n\nBut based on their previous pattern, they might choose paper again. So scissors. But if they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll expect them to choose paper again and I choose scissors, they might choose rock. So maybe I should choose paper to beat rock.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been following the pattern of my previous move's beaten move, and my last move was scissors (beats paper), they'll choose paper again. So scissors would work. But if they break the pattern and choose rock, I lose. But maybe the pattern is too consistent to ignore.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to counter my previous move. My last move was scissors, so they might choose rock. So I should choose paper.\n\nBut this is a lot of overthinking. Let's look at the history again:\n\nRound 1: Me: paper (beats their rock)\nRound 2: Me: rock (beats their scissors)\nRound 3: Me: scissors (beats their paper)\n\nSo their moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. That's a cycle in reverse order. So next would be rock again. So if they cycle rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, then next is rock. So I should choose paper again. That would give me 3 points if correct.\n\nAlternatively, they might think that since I used paper, rock, scissors, I'm cycling, so next I'll use paper again. So they might choose scissors to beat paper. Then I should choose rock to beat scissors.\n\nBut this is getting too tangled. Maybe the best approach is to cycle as well. Since I used paper, rock, scissors, next would be paper again. But that's a cycle. Alternatively, since the opponent is cycling rock, scissors, paper, next is rock. So paper beats rock. So I'll go with paper again.\n\nBut wait, the opponent's pattern is rock, scissors, paper. If they continue, next is rock. So paper would win. But if they break the cycle, maybe they'll do something else. But as a new player, they might not be that strategic. They might just be trying to counter the last move. For example, after losing with rock, they tried scissors (to beat paper), then after losing with scissors, they tried paper (to beat rock), then after losing with paper, they might try rock (to beat scissors). So if my last move was scissors, they choose rock. So I should choose paper.\n\nYes, that makes sense. If they are trying to counter my previous move each time, then:\n\n- I used scissors last, so they choose rock to beat scissors.\n- I should choose paper to beat their expected rock.\n\nThat seems logical. So the answer is paper.\n",

Let me check:\n\nRound 1: My move: paper. Their move: rock. Paper beats rock.\nRound 2: My move: rock. Their move: scissors. Rock beats scissors.\nRound 3: My move: scissors. Their move: paper. Scissors beats paper.\nRound 4: My move: paper. Their move: rock. Paper beats rock.\nRound 5: My move: rock. Their move: scissors. Rock beats scissors.\n\nSo their move in each round is the one that loses to my previous move. For example, after I played paper, they played rock (which loses to paper). Then after I played rock, they played scissors (loses to rock). Then after scissors, they played paper (loses to scissors). Then after paper again, rock again. Then after rock, scissors again. \n\nSo it seems like they are always choosing the move that would lose to my previous move. So if I played rock last time, they choose scissors. If I played scissors, they choose paper. If I played paper, they choose rock. \n\nIf that's the case, then in the next round, since my last move was rock, they will choose scissors again. So I should choose rock again to beat scissors. But wait, that's what I did last time, and they still chose scissors. But maybe they're stuck in this pattern. \n\nBut wait, if they keep choosing the move that loses to my previous move, then my next move should be the same as my previous move. Because if I played rock last time, they choose scissors, so I can play rock again to beat scissors. But in the previous rounds, after I played paper, they chose rock, so I played paper again, and they chose rock again. So maybe they are stuck in a loop where they always choose the move that loses to my previous move. \n\nIf that's the case, then my optimal strategy is to keep playing the same move, because they will keep choosing the losing move. For example, if I keep playing rock, they keep choosing scissors, and I keep winning. But in the game, after I played rock twice, they still chose scissors. So maybe they are not adapting. \n\nBut in the last round, I played rock, they played scissors. If I play rock again, they might play scissors again, leading to another win. But maybe they will realize the pattern and switch. However, given their past behavior, they haven't adapted yet. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are following a fixed pattern regardless of my moves. Their moves: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors. So next would be paper. If that's the case, I should play scissors. \n\nBut given that in each round, their move was the one that loses to my previous move, it's more likely that they are reacting to my previous move by choosing the losing move. So if I played rock last time, they choose scissors. Therefore, I can play rock again to beat scissors. \n\nBut if I keep doing that, they might eventually catch on and switch. However, since they are a new player, maybe they haven't figured it out yet. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to cycle through their moves in reverse order: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, etc. So next would be paper. \n\nBut given that in each case, their move was the one that loses to my previous move, the pattern seems more reactive. \n\nSo, to test this, if I play scissors next, they would play paper (since scissors beats paper). Then I can play scissors again to beat their paper. But wait, in the third round, I played scissors, and they played paper. Then in the fourth round, I played paper, and they played rock. So yes, each time they choose the move that loses to my previous move. \n\nTherefore, if my last move was rock, they will choose scissors. So I can play rock again. But if I do that, they might switch. However, since they haven't switched yet, maybe it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I switch to paper, expecting them to play rock (since my last move was rock, they might play scissors again, but if I play paper, paper beats rock. Wait, no. If my last move was rock, they play scissors. So if I play paper now, they would play rock (since paper beats rock). Wait, no. Let me clarify. \n\nIf the opponent's strategy is to choose the move that loses to my previous move, then:\n\n- If I played rock last time, they choose scissors (rock beats scissors).\n- If I played scissors last time, they choose paper (scissors beats paper).\n- If I played paper last time, they choose rock (paper beats rock).\n\nSo, in the next round, since my last move was rock, they will choose scissors. Therefore, I should play rock again to beat scissors. \n\nBut in the previous round, I played rock and they chose scissors. If I play rock again, they might choose scissors again, leading to another win. \n\nHowever, if they start to notice that I'm repeating rock, they might switch to paper to beat my rock. But since they are a new player and haven't adapted yet, maybe they'll stick to their pattern. \n\nAlternatively, to avoid being predictable, I could switch to paper, expecting them to play scissors (if they think I'll play rock again). Wait, no. If they are following the pattern of choosing the move that loses to my previous move, then regardless of what I choose next, they base their move on my previous move. \n\nWait, no. Their move is based on my previous move, not predicting my next move. So if I played rock last time, they choose scissors. My next move is independent. So if I choose paper now, their move would be based on my previous move (rock), so they choose scissors. Then paper beats scissors? Wait, no. Paper beats rock, scissors beat paper. So if they choose scissors (because I played rock last time), and I choose paper now, scissors would beat paper. That would be bad. \n\nWait, this is a key point. If the opponent's move is determined by my previous move, then:\n\n- My last move was rock.\n- They choose scissors (because rock beats scissors).\n- If I now choose paper, paper loses to scissors. So I would lose.\n\nBut if I choose rock again, rock beats scissors. So I win.\n\nIf I choose scissors, scissors would tie with scissors. \n\nTherefore, the safest move is to play rock again, expecting them to play scissors again. \n\nBut if they start to adapt and think, \"He's been playing rock twice, maybe he'll do it again, so I'll play paper,\" then I should play scissors. \n\nBut given that they are a new player and have been following the pattern so far, it's more likely they'll stick to the same strategy. \n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to play rock again. \n\nBut wait, in the previous rounds, after I played rock twice, they still chose scissors. So maybe they are not adapting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are cycling through their moves regardless of my actions. Their moves: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors. Next would be paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut which is more likely? The opponent reacting to my previous move or following their own cycle. \n\nGiven that in each round, their move was the one that loses to my previous move, it's more likely they are reacting. For example:\n\n- After I played paper, they played rock (loses to paper).\n- After I played rock, they played scissors (loses to rock).\n- After I played scissors, they played paper (loses to scissors).\n- After I played paper again, they played rock again.\n- After I played rock again, they played scissors again.\n\nSo this pattern suggests they are always choosing the move that loses to my previous move. Therefore, if I played rock last time, they will choose scissors again. So I should play rock again. \n\nBut if I keep doing this, they might eventually catch on. However, since they are a new player and haven't adapted yet, it's safe to continue. \n\nTherefore, the best move is to play rock again.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I just lost the last round because I chose rock and the opponent chose paper. So they probably noticed that I was sticking with rock after a couple of wins. Maybe they thought I'd keep using rock again, so they switched to paper to counter it. Now I need to adjust my strategy.\n\nHmm, the opponent's pattern so far has been: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper. Wait, let me check the history again. \n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they chose rock. I won. Then I chose rock, they chose scissors. I won again. Then scissors against their paper. Then paper against their rock. Then rock against their scissors. Then rock again, but they switched to paper. So after a few wins with rock, they anticipated me continuing and used paper. \n\nSo now, they might expect me to switch from rock to something else. If they just beat my rock with paper, maybe they'll think I'll go for scissors next to beat their paper. But if they predict that, they might switch to rock to counter my scissors. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again, thinking I'll stay with rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of cycling through moves. Let's see their moves: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper. Wait, that's a cycle of rock -> scissors -> paper -> rock... So after paper, they went back to rock. But in the last round, they chose paper again. Wait, no, the last move was paper, which beat my rock. So maybe their pattern is not a strict cycle. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my previous move. Let's see:\n\nMy moves: paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, rock.\n\nTheir moves: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper.\n\nSo when I played paper, they played rock. Then I played rock, they played scissors. Then scissors, they played paper. Then paper, they played rock. Then rock, they played scissors. Then rock again, they played paper. \n\nSo it seems like they are countering my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played rock (which loses to paper). Wait, no, that's not countering. Wait, maybe they are trying to predict my next move based on my previous one. Let me think.\n\nWait, when I played paper first, they played rock. Then I played rock, they played scissors. Then I played scissors, they played paper. Then I played paper again, they played rock. Then I played rock again, they played scissors. Then I played rock again, they played paper. \n\nSo their moves seem to be the move that would lose to my previous move. For example, after I played paper, they played rock (which loses to paper). Then after I played rock, they played scissors (loses to rock). Then after scissors, they played paper (loses to scissors). Then after paper again, rock. Then after rock, scissors. Then after rock again, paper. \n\nSo it seems like the opponent is always choosing the move that would lose to my previous move. That's a possible pattern. If that's the case, then they are always one step behind. So if I played rock last time, they choose scissors (which loses to rock). But in the last round, I played rock again, and they chose paper, which beats rock. Wait, that breaks the pattern. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe the opponent is trying to counter my previous move by choosing the move that would beat my previous move. Let's check:\n\nAfter I played paper (first move), they played rock (which loses to paper). Then I played rock, they played scissors (loses to rock). Then I played scissors, they played paper (loses to scissors). Then I played paper again, they played rock (loses to paper). Then I played rock again, they played scissors (loses to rock). Then I played rock again, they played paper (beats rock). \n\nSo up until the last move, they were choosing the move that loses to my previous move. But in the last round, when I played rock again, they switched to paper, which beats rock. So maybe they realized that I was repeating rock and adjusted. \n\nSo perhaps the opponent was following a pattern of choosing the move that loses to my previous move, but then when I repeated the same move (rock twice in a row), they changed their strategy to counter it. \n\nSo now, after I played rock and they countered with paper, they might expect me to switch to scissors to beat their paper. If they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock to beat my scissors. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again, thinking I might stay with rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are now trying to predict my next move based on my previous patterns. Since I've been using rock a lot, they might expect me to switch, so they might choose a move that beats scissors (like rock) or paper (like scissors). \n\nAlternatively, considering that they just successfully countered my rock with paper, they might expect me to switch to scissors, so they might choose rock. If I choose scissors, they choose rock, I lose. If I choose paper, they choose scissors, I win. If I choose rock again, they might choose paper again. \n\nBut since I just lost by choosing rock, I should avoid repeating it. So maybe I should switch to paper or scissors. \n\nIf I choose scissors, and they choose rock, I lose. If they choose paper, I win. If they choose scissors, it's a tie. \n\nIf I choose paper, and they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose rock, I win. If they choose paper, tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they will stick with paper again, thinking I might switch to scissors. But if they choose paper again, then I should choose scissors. But if they expect that, they might choose rock. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's think about possible strategies. \n\nOne common strategy is to detect the opponent's pattern. If the opponent was previously choosing the move that loses to my previous move, but then switched when I repeated, maybe they are now trying to counter my current move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a counter-strategy where they choose the move that beats my most frequent move. I've used rock three times, paper twice, scissors once. So rock is my most common. They might expect me to use rock again and choose paper. \n\nBut since I just lost with rock, I might switch. So they might expect me to switch to scissors or paper. \n\nIf I choose paper, and they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose rock, I win. \n\nIf I choose scissors, and they choose rock, I lose. If they choose paper, I win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are randomizing, but given the previous pattern, they might not be. \n\nAlternatively, since they just beat my rock with paper, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they'll choose rock. If I choose paper, I beat their rock. \n\nSo perhaps choosing paper now would be a good move, expecting them to choose rock again. But they might not. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used paper, maybe they'll cycle to the next move, which would be scissors. So if they go paper -> scissors, then I should choose rock to beat scissors. But that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are cycling through moves in a fixed order. Their moves so far: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper. So the pattern is rock -> scissors -> paper -> rock -> scissors -> paper. So next would be rock again. If that's the case, then I should choose paper to beat rock. \n\nBut in the last round, they broke the cycle. Wait, their previous moves were: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper. So after paper, the next would be rock again. But in the last round, they chose paper again. Wait, no, let me check the history again. \n\nWait, the opponent's moves were:\n\nRound 1: rock\n\nRound 2: scissors\n\nRound 3: paper\n\nRound 4: rock\n\nRound 5: scissors\n\nRound 6: paper\n\nSo the pattern is rock, scissors, paper, repeating every three rounds. So round 7 would be rock again. If that's the case, then choosing paper would beat their expected rock. \n\nBut in the last round (round 6), they chose paper, which beat my rock. So if the pattern continues, round 7 would be rock. So I should choose paper. \n\nBut maybe the opponent is aware of their own pattern and will change it. Alternatively, maybe they are following a different pattern. \n\nAlternatively, considering that they just used paper to beat my rock, they might expect me to switch to scissors, so they might choose rock. If I choose paper, I beat their rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper to beat their expected rock, so they might choose scissors to beat my paper. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. \n\nAnother approach: since I just lost with rock, I should avoid it. The opponent might expect me to switch to scissors or paper. \n\nIf I choose scissors, they might expect that and choose rock. \n\nIf I choose paper, they might expect that and choose scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with paper again. \n\nAlternatively, since they have a pattern of cycling through rock, scissors, paper, their next move would be rock. So I should choose paper. \n\nBut given that in the last round they broke the cycle (if it was a cycle), perhaps they are not following it anymore. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they choose the move that would have beaten my previous move. For example, after I chose rock, they chose paper (which beats rock). So if I choose scissors next, they might choose rock (which beats scissors). If I choose paper, they might choose scissors (which beats paper). If I choose rock again, they choose paper again. \n\nSo if their strategy is to choose the move that beats my previous move, then whatever I did last (rock), they will choose paper. So to counter that, I should choose scissors to beat their expected paper. \n\nWait, but in the last round, I chose rock, they chose paper. If their strategy is to beat my previous move, then next they will choose whatever beats my last move, which was rock. So they would choose paper again. Therefore, I should choose scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut if they think I will switch to scissors, they might choose rock instead. \n\nThis is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a tit-for-tat strategy, where they play the move that I played in the previous round. But in the previous round, I played rock, so they would play rock. But they played paper, so that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my last move. So since I played rock, they played paper. If I play scissors next, they would play rock. If I play paper, they play scissors. \n\nIf that's the case, then to counter their expected move (which is the move that beats my last move), I need to choose the move that beats their expected move. \n\nSo my last move was rock. They will choose paper (to beat rock). So I should choose scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut in the previous round, when I played rock, they did choose paper, so that strategy holds. So if I follow that logic, they will choose paper again. Therefore, I should choose scissors. \n\nBut wait, if they keep choosing paper every time I choose rock, then I can exploit that by choosing scissors. But if they realize that I'm switching to scissors, they might switch to rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are adapting. \n\nBut given that the opponent is a fresh player and has been following a pattern of countering my previous move, I can try to exploit that. \n\nSo, if I assume that the opponent will choose the move that beats my previous move (rock), which is paper, then I should choose scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut if they instead think I will switch to scissors and choose rock, then I would lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are now varying their strategy. \n\nGiven that I've been winning most rounds, the opponent might be trying to adjust. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother angle: the payoffs. Paper gives +3, which is the highest reward. So if I can predict when the opponent will play rock, using paper gives the most points. \n\nIn the last round, they played paper to beat my rock. If they continue to play paper, I should choose scissors. But if they switch back to rock, I should choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just succeeded with paper, they might stick with it. \n\nBut if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. \n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. The optimal strategy in rock-paper-scissors is to randomize moves, but since we're dealing with a predictable opponent, exploiting their pattern is key. \n\nGiven the opponent's history of countering my previous move (except when I repeated rock), perhaps they are now trying to counter my previous move. So if I last played rock, they play paper. To counter that, I should play scissors. \n\nBut if they expect that and play rock instead, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if I play paper, and they play scissors, I lose. \n\nThis is a risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is now cycling through their moves. Their last three moves were scissors, paper, paper. Wait, no, let's check:\n\nOpponent's moves:\n\n1. rock\n\n2. scissors\n\n3. paper\n\n4. rock\n\n5. scissors\n\n6. paper\n\nSo the pattern is rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper. So next would be rock again. If that's the case, I should play paper. \n\nBut in the last round, they played paper, which was part of the cycle. So if the cycle continues, next is rock. \n\nIf I follow that, I should play paper. \n\nBut if they break the cycle and play something else, like scissors, then paper would lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are following a different pattern. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to assume they continue their cycle and play rock next. So I choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just played paper, maybe they'll play scissors next. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to be certain. \n\nAnother approach: since I lost the last round by choosing rock, I should avoid it. The opponent might expect me to switch to scissors or paper. \n\nIf I choose scissors, and they choose rock, I lose. If they choose paper, I win. \n\nIf I choose paper, and they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose rock, I win. \n\nGiven that they just used paper, maybe they'll switch back to rock as part of their cycle. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with paper to try to beat my possible rock again. \n\nBut I just lost with rock, so I'm less likely to choose it again immediately. \n\nIf I choose scissors, and they choose paper, I win. If they choose rock, I lose. \n\nIf I choose paper, and they choose rock, I win. If they choose scissors, I lose. \n\nIt's a gamble. \n\nConsidering the opponent's possible patterns and the previous cycle, I'll go with paper, expecting them to choose rock again as part of their cycle. \n\nBut wait, their cycle after paper would be rock. So if they follow the cycle, next is rock. So paper beats rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they are now aware that I'm predicting their cycle, they might break it. \n\nBut given that they are a new player, they might not be adjusting yet. \n\nSo, final decision: choose paper to beat their expected rock.\n",

Let me recap the previous rounds to spot a pattern.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they chose rock. I won. Then they switched to scissors, I picked rock and won again. Next, they went to paper, I used scissors. Then they went back to rock, I used paper. Then scissors again, I used rock. Then they switched to paper, which beat my rock. Last round, I chose paper again, and they also chose paper, resulting in a tie.\n\nHmm, after losing with rock against my paper, they tried paper again but tied. Maybe they're trying to break the cycle. They might expect me to stick with paper again, so they might switch to scissors to beat paper. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors to counter their possible paper, so they might stay with paper. But since the last move was a tie with paper, they might try to switch to something else. Maybe they'll go back to rock, thinking I'll stay on paper. Or maybe they'll try scissors to beat my expected paper. I need to predict their next move based on their possible adjustments. Let's go with rock to beat scissors if they're trying to counter paper, or if they switch back to rock, it's a tie. Alternatively, maybe scissors to beat their possible paper. Wait, last time they used paper and tied, so maybe they'll switch to scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they think I'll switch from paper to rock, they might choose paper again. This is tricky. Let's see the pattern again: their moves were rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper. So after paper, they tried paper again. Now, after a tie, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So rock would be good. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again. Hmm. Maybe I should go with scissors to beat paper. But if they switch to scissors, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. Alternatively, if they go back to rock, scissors would lose. Wait, the last two moves were paper (tie) and before that, they had a pattern of rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper. So after paper, they tried paper again.

Alternatively, they might continue the cycle, so next would be rock. If that's the case, I should choose paper. But if they think I expect them to go back to rock and choose paper, they might choose scissors. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again. Given the tie last time, they might switch. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper if they repeat, but lose to rock. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. Hmm. Maybe the safest bet is to go with paper again, expecting them to return to rock. But they might anticipate that. Alternatively, since they've been following a cycle, maybe they'll go back to rock.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what move to make next. The opponent's pattern seems a bit tricky. Let me recap the previous rounds to spot any trends.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they chose rock. I won. Then I picked rock, they picked scissors. Another win. Then scissors against their paper. Another win. Then paper against their rock again. Then rock against their scissors. Then I stuck with rock again, but they switched to paper, so I lost. Then I tried paper again, which tied when they also chose paper. Then I went paper again, but they picked scissors, so I lost.\n\nHmm, so after a few wins, they started adapting. When I kept choosing rock twice, they switched to paper. Then when I went back to paper, they tied and then went scissors. It seems like they might be trying to counter my previous moves. Let's see the sequence of their moves: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors. Wait, that's not a clear cycle. Maybe they're reacting to my moves. For example, after I used paper multiple times, they started using scissors. When I used rock, they went paper. So maybe they're trying to counter my last move.\n\nIn the last round, I chose paper, they chose scissors. So if they think I might stick with paper again, they might go scissors again. But if I switch to rock, which beats scissors, I could win. Alternatively, if they expect me to switch to rock, they might go paper. But that's getting into second-guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of switching moves after a loss. Let's see their moves and outcomes:\n\n1. Rock (loss)\n2. Scissors (loss)\n3. Paper (loss)\n4. Rock (loss)\n5. Scissors (loss)\n6. Paper (win)\n7. Paper (tie)\n8. Scissors (win)\n\nWait, after their first win with paper, they tied with paper, then won with scissors. Maybe they're trying to vary their moves. If they won with scissors last time, maybe they'll stick with it or switch. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors, rock is good. But this is getting a bit too uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Let's see their moves in order: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors. That doesn't look like a strict cycle. Maybe they're using a strategy where they counter the last move. For example, after I played paper, they played scissors. So if I played scissors last, they might play rock. Wait, but in the last round, I played paper, they played scissors. So if they're countering my last move, they might expect me to play paper again and choose scissors again. But I just lost by choosing paper, so maybe they'll stick with scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern based on their own previous moves. Let's list their moves again:\n\n1. Rock\n2. Scissors\n3. Paper\n4. Rock\n5. Scissors\n6. Paper\n7. Paper\n8. Scissors\n\nLooking at this, after rock comes scissors, then paper, then rock again. Then scissors, paper, paper, scissors. It's a bit random, but maybe there's a cycle of rock -> scissors -> paper -> rock. If that's the case, after scissors, the next would be paper. But their last move was scissors, so next would be paper. If that's the cycle, then I should choose scissors to beat paper. But I'm not sure if that's their actual pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to avoid repeating the same move too much. They used scissors twice in a row (moves 2 and 5), then paper twice (6 and 7), then scissors again. Maybe they alternate more. But it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven that they just beat me with scissors when I chose paper, they might expect me to switch to rock to counter scissors. If they think that, they might switch to paper to beat my rock. In that case, I should choose scissors to beat their expected paper. But this is a lot of mind games.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been successful with scissors last time, maybe they'll stick with it. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, their last move was scissors. The move that beats scissors is rock. So they might play rock next. If that's the case, I should play paper to beat rock. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, considering that they've been changing their move each time, maybe they'll switch from scissors to rock. If so, paper would win. But again, this is a guess.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their responses. They lost when I played paper, then rock, then scissors, then paper, then rock, then scissors, then paper. Wait, no, the sequence of my moves was paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, rock, paper, paper. Their responses were rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors.\n\nLooking at their responses to my moves:\n\nWhen I played paper, they played rock (first round) and then scissors (last two times). Wait, no, in the first round, I played paper, they played rock. Then when I played paper again in round 4, they played rock again. Then in round 7, I played paper, they played paper (tie). Then in round 8, I played paper, they played scissors. So their response to my paper has been rock, rock, paper, scissors. Not a clear pattern.\n\nWhen I played rock, they played scissors (round 2 and 5), then paper (round 6). So when I play rock, they sometimes play scissors, sometimes paper.\n\nWhen I played scissors (round 3), they played paper. Then when I played scissors again (round 8?), no, in round 3 I played scissors, they played paper. Then in later rounds, I didn't play scissors again until maybe round 8? Wait, let me check:\n\nRound 1: me paper, them rock\nRound 2: me rock, them scissors\nRound 3: me scissors, them paper\nRound 4: me paper, them rock\nRound 5: me rock, them scissors\nRound 6: me paper, them paper\nRound 7: me paper, them scissors\nRound 8: me paper, them scissors (lost)\nWait, no, in round 7, I played paper, they played paper (tie). Then in round 8, I played paper again, they played scissors (I lost). Then in the last round, I played paper again, they played scissors again, leading to my loss.\n\nSo their response to my paper has been rock, rock, paper, scissors, scissors. So they might be shifting to countering my paper with scissors. If I keep playing paper, they might keep choosing scissors. So to counter that, I should play rock to beat scissors. But if they expect that, they might switch to paper. It's a bit of a guessing game.\n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten my paper with scissors twice in a row, maybe they'll stick with scissors. So I should play rock. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their paper. But this is getting into higher-level thinking.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a simple strategy of playing the move that beats my last move. For example, in the last round, I played paper, so they played scissors. If I play scissors next, they might play rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. But this is assuming they follow that pattern.\n\nAlternatively, if they're using a rotating strategy, like rock-paper-scissors in order, but their moves don't show that. Their moves have been rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors. It's not a strict rotation.\n\nGiven all this uncertainty, maybe the safest bet is to switch to a move that hasn't been used recently. Let's see, my last move was paper, which lost. Their last move was scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they expect that and play paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors, I win. It's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, since they've used scissors twice in a row (last two times they played scissors), maybe they'll switch. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten their last move. Their last move was scissors, so the move that beats scissors is rock. So they might play rock next. If that's the case, I should play paper.\n\nBut this is all speculative. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best approach is to choose the move that beats their most frequent move. Looking at their moves: rock (3 times), scissors (4 times), paper (2 times). So they've used scissors most often. To counter scissors, I should play rock. But they might expect that and switch to paper.\n\nAlternatively, since they just used scissors twice, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to rock, I play paper. If they switch to paper, I play scissors. But again, it's a guess.\n\nGiven that they've beaten me twice with scissors when I played paper, they might expect me to switch to rock. If they do, they'll play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. But this is a level 2 thinking.\n\nAlternatively, if they're not thinking that deeply, they might just repeat scissors. So rock would be safe.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe I should go with rock to counter their possible scissors again. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to catch them if they expect rock and play paper. But if they play scissors again, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, since the last two times they played scissors, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to rock, I play paper. If they switch to paper, I play scissors. But without knowing, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a mixed strategy. Since they've been using scissors a lot, maybe rock is a good choice. But given the previous losses when I assumed they'd stick with a move, maybe it's better to vary.\n\nWait, in the last round, I played paper and they played scissors. If I play scissors now, and they play scissors again, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to paper, I win. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through their moves. Their last three moves were paper, scissors, scissors. Not a clear cycle.\n\nI think the best bet is to assume they'll continue with scissors, so play rock. But given that they might expect that, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But this is a risk.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been successful with scissors, they might stick with it. So rock would be the safe choice. But if they switch, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, given that they've used scissors twice, maybe they'll switch to rock. So I should play paper.\n\nThis is really a 50-50 guess. Without a clear pattern, it's hard. Maybe the best approach is to choose randomly, but since I need to make a decision, I'll go with rock to counter their possible scissors again. But given that they might expect that, maybe paper. Wait, no. If they expect rock, they play paper. So scissors would beat paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, use the previous pattern. They beat my paper with scissors, so if I play scissors, they might expect me to play rock and thus play paper. So scissors beats paper. But if they play scissors again, it's a tie. If they play rock, I lose.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to choose rock, expecting them to play scissors again. If they do, I win. If not, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to counter their possible switch to paper.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors more, rock is statistically better. Let's go with rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent's moves so far have been: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nFirst round: opponent chose rock, I chose paper and won. Then they switched to scissors, I chose rock and won. Then they went to paper, I chose scissors and won. Then they went back to rock, I chose paper again and won. Then they switched to scissors again, I chose rock and won. Then they tried paper, I chose scissors again. Then they went to scissors, I chose rock and won. Then they tried paper again, I chose scissors but they chose scissors that time? Wait, no. Let me retrace the steps based on the hints provided.\n\nLooking back at the history:\n\n1. Round 1: Opponent rock, me paper. I won.\n2. Round 2: Opponent scissors, me rock. I won.\n3. Round 3: Opponent paper, me scissors. I won.\n4. Round 4: Opponent rock, me paper. I won.\n5. Round 5: Opponent scissors, me rock. I won.\n6. Round 6: Opponent paper, me scissors. I won.\n7. Round 7: Opponent scissors, me rock. I won.\n8. Round 8: Opponent paper, me scissors. I lost because they chose scissors? Wait, no. Wait, the last rounds:\n\nAfter the tie when both chose paper, then I chose paper again and they chose scissors, so I lost. Then I chose rock, they chose scissors again, and I won. Now, the next move.\n\nThe opponent's pattern seems to be cycling through rock, scissors, paper, but maybe not in a strict order. Let's list their moves based on the results:\n\n1. Opponent: rock (I chose paper)\n2. Opponent: scissors (I chose rock)\n3. Opponent: paper (I chose scissors)\n4. Opponent: rock (I chose paper)\n5. Opponent: scissors (I chose rock)\n6. Opponent: paper (I chose scissors)\n7. Opponent: scissors (I chose rock) - but here, in round 7, the opponent chose scissors again, and I chose rock, won.\n8. Then in the next round, opponent chose paper, I chose scissors, but they chose scissors? Wait, no. Wait, the user's last message says:\n\nAfter the tie (both paper), then I chose paper again and lost because they chose scissors. Then I chose rock, they chose scissors again, and I won. So opponent's moves: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors.\n\nWait, maybe the opponent is cycling through rock, scissors, paper, but sometimes repeating. Alternatively, they might be trying to counter my previous move. For example, after I play paper, they might switch to scissors, then I play rock, they switch to paper, etc. But their moves seem a bit inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a pattern where they choose the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I played paper, they might choose scissors next. But in the last round, I played rock, they chose scissors, which is beaten by rock. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe they are trying to predict my next move based on my previous pattern.\n\nLooking at my moves: I've been cycling through paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, etc., but adjusting based on their moves. The opponent might be trying to counter my expected move. For example, after I played paper, they might expect me to play rock next (since I alternated before), so they play paper to beat rock. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be following a simple pattern like rock-paper-scissors in order, but with some variations. Let's see their moves again:\n\n1. Rock\n2. Scissors\n3. Paper\n4. Rock\n5. Scissors\n6. Paper\n7. Scissors\n8. Paper\n9. Scissors\n\nWait, after the initial rock, scissors, paper, they went back to rock, scissors, paper, then scissors, paper, scissors. It's possible they are cycling but sometimes repeating. Maybe they are trying to break the cycle after a loss. For example, after losing with paper, they might go back to rock. But it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be using a strategy where they choose the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I last played rock, they might play paper next. Let's check:\n\n- After I played paper (win), they played scissors (which beats paper). Then I played rock (beats scissors), they played paper (beats rock). Then I played scissors (beats paper), they played rock (beats scissors). Then I played paper (beats rock), they played scissors (beats paper). Then I played rock (beats scissors), they played paper (beats rock). Then I played scissors (beats paper), they played scissors (which is a tie if I had played scissors, but in that case, I lost because they chose scissors when I chose paper. Wait, no. Let me check the exact sequence again.\n\nWait, the user's history is as follows (from the hints):\n\nRound 1: I chose paper, opponent rock. I won.\nRound 2: I chose rock, opponent scissors. I won.\nRound 3: I chose scissors, opponent paper. I won.\nRound 4: I chose paper, opponent rock. I won.\nRound 5: I chose rock, opponent scissors. I won.\nRound 6: I chose scissors, opponent paper. I won.\nRound 7: I chose rock, opponent scissors. I won.\nRound 8: I chose paper, opponent scissors. I lost.\nRound 9: I chose rock, opponent scissors. I won.\nNow, the next round.\n\nLooking at the opponent's moves: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors? Wait, no. Let me list each round's opponent move based on the hints:\n\n1. Opponent: rock (I chose paper)\n2. Opponent: scissors (I chose rock)\n3. Opponent: paper (I chose scissors)\n4. Opponent: rock (I chose paper)\n5. Opponent: scissors (I chose rock)\n6. Opponent: paper (I chose scissors)\n7. Opponent: scissors (I chose rock)\n8. Opponent: scissors (I chose paper, lost)\n9. Opponent: scissors (I chose rock, won)\n\nWait, in round 8, the opponent chose scissors when I chose paper, so I lost. Then in round 9, I chose rock, they chose scissors again, and I won. Now, the next move.\n\nSo the opponent's last three moves were scissors, scissors, scissors. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nRound 7: opponent scissors\nRound 8: opponent scissors\nRound 9: opponent scissors\n\nWait, no. Let me check again:\n\nRound 7: I chose rock, opponent scissors. I won.\nRound 8: I chose paper, opponent scissors. I lost (because scissors beats paper).\nRound 9: I chose rock, opponent scissors. I won.\n\nSo opponent's last three moves were scissors, scissors, scissors. So they chose scissors three times in a row. But in round 8, they chose scissors again after I had chosen paper (which lost to their scissors). Then in round 9, they chose scissors again, which I beat with rock. Now, what's next?\n\nIf the opponent is sticking with scissors, maybe they'll switch. But why would they choose scissors three times? Maybe they're trying to counter my expected move. For example, after I lost with paper (round 8), they might expect me to switch to rock (to beat scissors), so they could switch to paper. But in round 9, they chose scissors again, which I beat with rock. Now, if they keep choosing scissors, I can keep choosing rock. But they might switch to paper to beat my rock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are stuck in a loop of choosing scissors. But that's unlikely. More likely, they might switch to paper to counter my expected rock. So if I keep choosing rock, they might choose paper. Therefore, I should choose scissors to beat their expected paper. But this is a bit of a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, since they've chosen scissors three times, maybe they'll switch back to rock. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But if they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in their moves. The opponent's moves so far: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors. Wait, that's not a clear cycle. It seems after the initial rock-scissors-paper cycle, they started repeating scissors. Maybe they are trying to exploit my pattern. For example, if I tend to choose rock after they choose scissors, they might switch to paper. But in the last round, they chose scissors again, which I beat with rock. So maybe they are not adapting.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be a bot that cycles through moves in a certain order. If they were following rock-paper-scissors-rock-paper-scissors, but after a few rounds, they started repeating scissors. Maybe they have a bug or a specific pattern.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the opponent is a new player, they might be making random moves or trying to counter my last move. For example, if I played rock last time, they might play paper this time. Since I played rock in the last round, they might choose paper now. Therefore, I should choose scissors to beat paper.\n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's see: in round 9, I chose rock, they chose scissors. If they follow the pattern of choosing the move that beats my last move, then after I chose rock, they would choose paper. So I should choose scissors to beat their expected paper.\n\nAlternatively, if they are trying to counter my previous move, which was rock, they might choose paper. So I should choose scissors.\n\nBut if they are sticking with scissors, then I should choose rock again. But they might switch.\n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Given that they chose scissors three times in a row, maybe they'll switch. But it's hard to predict. However, since they lost the last round by choosing scissors against my rock, they might switch to paper. Therefore, I should choose scissors to beat paper.\n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stick with rock, they might choose paper, so I should choose scissors. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. But that's getting too meta.\n\nAlternatively, since I've been alternating between paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, etc., maybe they expect me to follow that pattern. My last move was rock, so next would be paper. If they expect me to choose paper, they might choose scissors. So I should choose rock to beat scissors again. But they might anticipate that and choose paper.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. The opponent's recent moves: scissors, scissors, scissors. If they keep choosing scissors, I should keep choosing rock. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, I should choose paper. But given that they've chosen scissors three times, maybe they'll switch. But how to know?\n\nAlternatively, since they lost the last round with scissors, they might switch. If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. But without knowing, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, use a counter-strategy. Since they've been choosing scissors a lot, maybe they'll continue. But after three times, they might think I expect them to switch. So they might stick with scissors to surprise me. In that case, I should choose rock again.\n\nBut this is a gamble. Alternatively, use a mixed strategy. But since this is a deterministic game, the best approach is to predict their next move based on their history.\n\nGiven that the opponent's last three moves were scissors, scissors, scissors, perhaps they are stuck on scissors. So choosing rock again would win. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, I should choose paper. But there's no indication of that.\n\nAlternatively, considering that after three losses with scissors, they might switch to paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper.\n\nBut this is all speculative. Another angle: the opponent's initial pattern was rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, then scissors, scissors, scissors. Maybe they started with a cycle but then got stuck on scissors. If they continue the initial cycle, the next move after scissors would be paper. But they already did that in round 6. Wait, their moves:\n\n1. Rock\n2. Scissors\n3. Paper\n4. Rock\n5. Scissors\n6. Paper\n7. Scissors\n8. Scissors\n9. Scissors\n\nSo after the initial rock-scissors-paper cycle twice (rounds 1-6), they went scissors three times. Maybe they're now in a scissors loop. If that's the case, rock is safe. But if they break the loop, it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be using a strategy where they choose the move that beats the move that beat their last move. For example, in round 9, they chose scissors, which was beaten by my rock. The move that beats rock is paper, so they might choose paper next. Therefore, I should choose scissors to beat paper.\n\nAlternatively, they might think that since I've been choosing rock to beat their scissors, I'll do it again, so they choose paper. Therefore, I should choose scissors.\n\nBut this is a lot of second-guessing. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to assume they'll continue with scissors, so choose rock again. But if they switch, I lose. Alternatively, if they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. But without knowing, it's a gamble.\n\nAnother approach: since the opponent has lost three times in a row with scissors, they might be frustrated and switch. The most logical switch would be to paper to beat my expected rock. Therefore, I should choose scissors to beat their expected paper.\n\nAlternatively, they might switch to rock, expecting me to choose scissors. But that's less likely.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the opponent's recent pattern of scissors and possible adaptation, I'll predict they switch to paper and choose scissors.\n",

But that's getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is following a pattern of repeating their move after a loss. Let's see:\n\nAfter round 1: they lost with rock, then switched to scissors.\nRound 2: lost with scissors, switched to paper.\nRound 3: lost with paper, switched to rock.\nRound 4: lost with rock, switched to scissors.\nRound 5: lost with scissors, switched to paper.\nRound 6: lost with paper, switched to scissors (but wait, in round 7, they chose paper again after I lost. Hmm, maybe not a strict pattern.\n\nAlternatively, when they win, they stick with the same move. For example, in round 7, they won with paper, then in round 8, they chose scissors (which is a switch). So that doesn't hold. Maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. For example, after I chose paper, they chose scissors. After I chose rock, they chose paper. After I chose scissors, they chose rock. But in some cases, they didn't. For example, after I chose scissors (round 3), they chose paper (which is correct), but then in round 4, I chose paper, they chose rock. So that's a counter. Then in round 5, I chose rock, they chose scissors. Round 6, I chose scissors, they chose paper. Round 7, I chose rock, they chose paper. Round 8, I chose paper, they chose scissors. Round 9, I chose rock, they chose scissors. Round 10, I chose scissors, they chose paper. Round 11, I chose paper, they chose rock. Round 12, I chose rock, they chose scissors. Round 13, I need to choose.\n\nIf the opponent is trying to counter my previous move, then after I chose rock last time, they might expect me to choose paper next, so they would choose scissors. But if I choose scissors, I can beat their expected scissors (if they think I'll choose paper). Wait, no. If they think I'll choose paper, they choose scissors. So to counter that, I should choose rock. But this is getting too into their head. Alternatively, based on their history, after I play rock, they tend to play scissors (as in rounds 2,5,9,12). So maybe they'll play scissors again. But in round 7, after I played rock, they played paper. So there's inconsistency. Maybe they alternate between responding to my move and following a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the opponent's moves: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors. The last few moves after round 7: paper, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors. It's a bit hard to see a clear pattern. Maybe they are cycling through rock, scissors, paper, but sometimes repeating. If the next move in the cycle after scissors is paper, then I should choose scissors. But if they break the cycle and choose rock again, then paper would be better. Alternatively, since they just chose scissors in the last round, maybe they'll go back to paper. But in the previous cycle after scissors, they went to paper. So perhaps scissors -> paper -> rock -> scissors... So after scissors, next is paper. Therefore, I should choose scissors to beat paper. But wait, in the last round, they chose scissors. If the cycle is rock, scissors, paper, then after scissors comes paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. Alternatively, if they are stuck on scissors, maybe they'll choose rock. But that's not following the cycle. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the opponent has a tendency to switch to the next move in the cycle after a loss. Since they lost with scissors last time, they might switch to paper. So I should choose scissors. But if they instead decide to go back to rock, then paper would win. But given the cycle, paper is next. So scissors is the safe choice. Alternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my previous rock by choosing paper, so I should choose scissors. But I'm not sure. Given the uncertainty, maybe the best move is to choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. Alternatively, if they keep choosing scissors, then rock would win again. But they just chose scissors in the last round, and the pattern before was rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors. So after scissors, maybe paper again. So scissors would beat paper. But in the previous instances, after scissors they went to paper. So I'll go with scissors.\n",

The previous moves have shown a pattern where the opponent tends to switch moves after consecutive losses. For example, when the user played paper, the opponent went from rock to scissors, then to paper, and so on.\n\nIn the last round, the user played rock and won against the opponent's scissors. Now, the opponent might anticipate that the user will stick with rock again, so they might switch to paper to counter. But wait, the opponent has been switching their moves in a cycle: rock, scissors, paper, rock, etc. After scissors, the next logical move in their cycle might be paper. However, the user just beat scissors with rock, so the opponent might expect the user to stay with rock and thus play paper to beat it. Alternatively, the opponent might revert to rock again, thinking the user will switch to scissors.\n\nBut considering the opponent's previous behavior, after losing with scissors, they might switch to paper. If the user plays scissors now, they can beat paper. However, if the opponent expects the user to switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors instead. This is getting a bit complicated.

Then opponent went back to rock (user played paper and won).\n11. Then opponent switched to scissors (user played rock and won).\n\nLooking at this, the opponent's pattern seems to cycle through rock -> scissors -> paper -> rock, etc. After scissors, the next move is paper, then rock again. The last move was scissors, so the next expected move would be paper. Therefore, the user should play scissors to beat paper. But wait, the user just played rock and won against scissors. If the opponent follows their cycle, they should play paper next. So scissors would be the correct move. However, the opponent might break the cycle if they notice the user is predicting their moves.

Then paper again, they played rock. So it seems like they were following a rock -> scissors -> paper -> rock cycle. But after a few rounds, they started to adjust. \n\nWait, after I played paper and they played rock, I kept playing paper again, and they switched to scissors, which made me lose.

But looking at the recent moves, the opponent seems to be cycling through rock, scissors, paper repeatedly. Every time I counter their current move, they go to the next in the cycle. So after rock comes scissors, then paper, then rock again. \n\nGiven that the last move was scissors (which I beat with rock), the next in their cycle would be paper. So if I play scissors, I can beat their expected paper. But if they break the cycle and stay with scissors to counter my expected paper, then I should play rock again. However, since they've been following the cycle strictly, it's safer to assume they'll go to paper next. Therefore, playing scissors would be the optimal move.\n",

I've been countering their moves by predicting the next in their cycle. Last time they played paper, so according to their cycle, the next move should be scissors. To beat scissors, I should play rock. Wait, but in the previous rounds, when they played scissors, I played scissors and won. Hmm, maybe they're sticking to the cycle. Let me check the history again.\n\nWait, the last few moves: they played paper, then scissors, then rock, then paper again. It seems like a cycle of rock-paper-scissors. If they just played scissors, the next would be rock. But in the last round, they played paper, so next should be scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But wait, when they played paper, I played paper and tied once. Maybe they'll switch it up. Alternatively, they might expect me to predict their cycle and counter. Maybe they'll go back to rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But I need to consider their possible adjustments. Let me think. Since they've been following a cycle, even after a tie, they might continue. So if their last move was paper, next is scissors. So I should play rock. But in the previous instance, when I played rock, they played scissors, which I beat. If they expect me to play rock again, they might switch to paper. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should stick to the cycle prediction. If their cycle is rock-paper-scissors, after paper comes scissors. So I'll play rock to beat scissors. Alternatively, if they break the cycle, maybe they'll go back to rock. Then paper would be better. Hmm. I need to decide. Let's go with the cycle prediction. Play rock to beat their expected scissors.\n",

If they were cycling through rock, paper, scissors, after a tie on rock, they might expect me to stay on rock again. So perhaps they'll switch to paper to beat my expected rock. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat their paper. Alternatively, they might stick with rock again, thinking I'll change. But since we just tied, they might anticipate me changing. Hmm. Maybe paper is a safer bet if they think I'll go to paper. Wait, but if they play paper, I should play scissors. But if they think I'm switching from rock, they might go paper, so scissors would win. Alternatively, if they think I'll stay on rock, they might play paper. Either way, scissors could be a good move here. Or maybe they'll switch back to scissors. If they do, then rock would win.
