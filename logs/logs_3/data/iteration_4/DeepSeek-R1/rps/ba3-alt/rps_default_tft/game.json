      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a game against another player, and they need to choose between paper, rock, or scissors. The previous attempt had a formatting error, so I need to make sure the response follows the correct structure this time.\n\nFirst, the user's initial move was paper, with the reasoning that a new player might choose rock. But the system pointed out an error in the message format. The correction says that the move message should start with [move], followed by an optional explanation in parentheses, and then the move. Also, they shouldn't use markdown or nested parentheses.\n\nSo the user's previous message had \"[move] (Explanation) Paper\" but maybe the parentheses were not properly formatted. The system wants the explanation in parentheses right after the [move] tag, without any other tags or markdown. Also, the move should be lowercase? Let me check the example given: \"Your move here\" with valid moves as 'paper', 'rock', or 'scissors' in lowercase.\n\nIn the initial response, the user wrote \"Paper\" with a capital P. Maybe that's an issue. The system's example uses lowercase, so the move should be in lowercase. Also, the explanation should be concise and within parentheses immediately after the [move] tag.\n\nSo the correct format should be: [move] (Explanation here) paper\n\nNo markdown, no nested parentheses. The explanation is optional but if included, it's in parentheses right after the [move] tag, then the move in lowercase.\n\nSo the user needs to resend the move with the corrected format. The reasoning is still valid: anticipating a new player might pick rock, so counter with paper. But the formatting needs to be fixed.\n\nTherefore, the correct response should be:\n\n[move] (Anticipating a common first choice of rock by a new player, I'll counter with paper to maximize potential gain.) paper\n\nCheck for any parentheses issues or uppercase letters. The move is now lowercase, explanation in parentheses, no markdown. That should comply with the system's requirements.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the first round I chose paper because I thought a new player might start with rock. But both of us ended up picking paper, so it was a tie. Now I need to adjust my strategy.\n\nHmm, maybe the other player is also thinking the same way. They might have expected me to choose paper again, so they could switch to scissors to beat my paper. But wait, if I think they'll switch to scissors, then I should choose rock to beat their scissors. But then again, if they think I'm going to switch to rock, they might stay with paper. This is getting a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, since the first move was paper and it was a tie, maybe the player will stick with paper again, thinking I might switch. If I choose scissors this time, I can beat their paper. But if they stay with paper, I win. If they switch to rock, then scissors lose. Wait, no, scissors lose to rock. So if they switch to rock, scissors would be a bad choice. \n\nWait, the previous move was paper. Maybe the player will try to counter my previous paper by choosing scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. But if they stick with paper again, rock would lose. Hmm. What's the best move here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the player is trying to predict my move. Since I chose paper first and it tied, they might expect me to switch. If I choose scissors, they might think I'll go for paper again and choose scissors, so I should choose rock. But this is getting too convoluted. Maybe a simple pattern? Like, if they tied with paper, they might switch to something else. Maybe scissors. So I should choose rock. Or maybe they stay with paper again. Then I should choose scissors. \n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs: rock gives 3 points if it beats paper, which is a higher reward. But scissors only gives 1 point. Maybe the player is more likely to go for rock now to get higher points. If they choose rock, I should choose paper again. But if they think I'll stay with paper, they might choose scissors. Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should use a mixed strategy. But since it's a new player, maybe they have a pattern. \n\nWait, the first round was paper vs paper. So the player chose paper. Maybe they are a new player who just picks randomly, or maybe they have a tendency. If they picked paper first, maybe they'll stick with it again. So I should choose scissors to beat their paper. But if they switch to rock, then scissors lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. So maybe I should choose paper again. But that could lead to another tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the player is trying to counter my previous move. Since I chose paper first, they might expect me to switch, so they'll choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. But if they stick with paper, then rock loses. Hmm. This is a bit of a dilemma. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to choose rock this time. If they think I'll switch from paper, they might expect scissors and choose rock, leading to a tie. Or if they stick with paper, rock would lose. Wait, no. Rock beats paper. Wait, no, paper beats rock. Wait, the rules: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beat rock. So if I choose rock, and they choose paper, they win. If they choose scissors, I win. If they choose rock, it's a tie. \n\nWait, the initial rules: paper beats scissors (1 point), rock beats paper (3 points), scissors beat rock (1 point). So if I choose rock and they choose paper, they get 3 points. If they choose scissors, I get 1 point. If they choose rock, tie. \n\nSo considering that, maybe the player, after a tie with paper, might switch to rock to try to beat paper. So if I choose scissors, I can beat their rock. But if they stick with paper, scissors would lose. Alternatively, if they switch to scissors, expecting me to stay with paper, then scissors would beat my paper. So maybe I should choose rock to beat their scissors. \n\nThis is getting a bit too much. Maybe the safest bet is to switch to scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. If they do, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, tie. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, so I should choose paper again. But if they think I'll stay with paper, they might choose scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since the first move was paper and it tied, maybe the player will try to counter by choosing scissors. So I should choose rock to beat their scissors. But if they choose paper again, then rock loses. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to choose scissors. If they stick with paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, tie. But given that they are a new player, maybe they'll stick with the same move. Or maybe they'll switch. It's hard to predict. \n\nAlternatively, considering that rock gives higher points, maybe they'll go for rock. So I should choose paper again. But if they do that, and I choose paper, tie again. If they choose rock, paper wins. \n\nWait, but in the first round, they chose paper. If they think I'll choose paper again, they might choose scissors. So I should choose rock. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper again. \n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. Maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I can't do that here, I need to make an educated guess. \n\nGiven that they are a new player, maybe they'll switch to rock to try to get the higher points. So I should choose paper again. But if they do that, paper beats rock, I get 3 points. If they stick with paper, tie. If they choose scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to scissors to beat paper. So I should choose rock. \n\nBut how to decide? Maybe the player, after a tie, will try to switch to a move that beats the previous one. Since I chose paper, they might choose scissors. So rock would beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might think that I'll stay with paper, so they choose scissors, so I should choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they choose rock. Then I should choose paper. \n\nThis is a bit of a loop. Maybe the best approach is to choose rock, expecting them to switch to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since the first move was paper, and they tied, maybe they'll stick with paper again. So I should choose scissors. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the safest move is to switch to scissors. If they stick with paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, so I should choose paper again. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with scissors, expecting them to stay with paper.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The last few rounds have been a bit of a back-and-forth. Let me try to figure out the opponent's pattern here.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they also chose paper. Tie. Then I switched to scissors, they picked rock, which I beat. Then I went scissors again, but they chose paper, so I lost. Hmm. So after the first tie with paper, they went rock when I went scissors. Then when I repeated scissors, they went paper. \n\nWait, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Let me break it down:\n\nRound 1: Both paper. Tie.\nRound 2: I chose scissors, they chose rock. They lost, so maybe they thought I'd stick with paper again and tried to counter with rock. But I switched to scissors, which beats their rock. Wait, no, scissors lose to rock. Wait, the user said I won the round when I chose scissors and they chose rock. Wait, that's not right. Because rock beats scissors. So maybe there was a mistake in the user's message. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user said: \"You won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored 1 points.\" But according to the rules, rock beats scissors, so that should be a loss. Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules. Let me recheck the rules provided earlier.\n\nOriginal rules:\n- paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n- rock beats paper (winner +3, loser -3)\n- scissors beats rock (winner +1, loser -1)\n- Same move: tie, 0 points.\n\nSo scissors beats rock, giving the winner 1 point. Oh right, scissors beats rock. So if I chose scissors and they chose rock, I win. Got it. So in round 2, I chose scissors, they chose rock, I won. Then in round 3, I chose scissors again, they chose paper, which I lost because paper beats scissors. So they switched from rock to paper after losing with rock. Now, in the next round, what should I do?\n\nThey started with paper (tie), then rock (lost to my scissors), then paper (beat my scissors). So their pattern might be: after losing with rock, they switched to paper. Now, if I assume they might stick with paper again, expecting me to choose scissors again, but I need to counter that. If they choose paper again, I should choose scissors to beat it. But wait, in the last round, they chose paper when I chose scissors, which beat me. So maybe they expect me to switch to rock to beat their paper. But if I choose rock, and they choose paper again, they get +3. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose scissors to beat my rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between rock and paper. Let's see their moves so far: paper, rock, paper. So maybe they'll go back to rock again. If that's the case, I should choose paper. But if they're following a pattern of paper, rock, paper, next could be rock again. But that's a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my moves. Let's see my moves: paper, scissors, scissors. They chose paper, rock, paper. So after I did scissors twice, they went paper. Maybe they expect me to switch to rock, so they might choose scissors to beat my rock. But I could choose rock to beat their scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll stick with scissors, they might choose rock again. Wait, but in round 3, they chose paper to beat my scissors. So perhaps they are countering my previous move. Since I did scissors twice, they went paper. Now, if I switch to rock, they might expect that and choose paper again. But if I choose paper, I can beat their rock if they go back to it. But they just chose paper, so maybe they'll stick with it. Alternatively, they might switch to scissors to beat my paper. This is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a strategy that's less predictable. Since they've seen me choose scissors twice, they might expect me to switch. If I choose rock this time, it beats scissors (if they choose scissors expecting my paper), but if they choose paper again, I lose. Alternatively, if I choose paper, it beats rock (if they go back to rock) but loses to scissors. Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to alternate. Since I did scissors twice, maybe switch to rock. If they expect me to continue with scissors, they might choose paper again, which would lose to my rock. Wait, no: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beat paper. So if they choose paper again, and I choose rock, they get +3. That's bad. Alternatively, if they choose scissors, expecting me to choose rock, then I choose rock and win. But this is a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are following a pattern of paper, rock, paper, so next is rock. If that's the case, I should choose paper. But that's assuming a pattern which might not hold. Alternatively, since they just won with paper against my scissors, they might stick with paper again. If I choose scissors again, I lose. If I choose rock, I lose. If I choose paper, tie. Hmm. Maybe I should choose paper to tie, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to rock, so they choose paper. So I should choose scissors to beat their paper. Wait, but they just beat me with paper when I chose scissors. Maybe they think I'll avoid scissors now. So if I choose scissors again, they might choose rock, which I can beat. Wait, scissors beat rock. So if they choose rock, and I choose scissors, I win. But if they choose paper again, I lose. It's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a counter-strategy. Let's see their moves against mine:\n\nMy move: paper \u2192 their move: paper (tie)\nMy move: scissors \u2192 their move: rock (I win)\nMy move: scissors \u2192 their move: paper (they win)\n\nSo after I chose scissors twice, they switched from rock to paper. Now, if I choose scissors again, they might expect it and choose rock again. But in the last round, they chose paper, which beat my scissors. So maybe they think I'll switch to rock, so they'll choose paper. If I choose scissors again, they might choose rock, which I can beat. But if they choose paper again, I lose. Alternatively, if I choose rock, they might choose paper, which beats me. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a mixed strategy. Since they've seen me do scissors twice, maybe they expect a change. If I switch to rock, and they choose paper, I lose. If they choose scissors, I win. If I switch to paper, and they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose rock, I win. It's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, copying my last move. Let's see:\n\nMy moves: paper, scissors, scissors\nTheir moves: paper, rock, paper\n\nNo, that doesn't fit. They didn't copy my last move. Alternatively, they might be countering my last move. After I chose scissors, they chose rock (which beats scissors). Then when I chose scissors again, they chose paper (which beats scissors). Wait, no: paper doesn't beat scissors. Wait, according to the rules, paper beats scissors. Wait, the original rules say paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1). So if I choose scissors and they choose paper, I win. Wait, no: paper beats scissors, so if they choose paper and I choose scissors, they win. Wait, the user's message said in the third round: \"You lost the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored -1 points.\" So that's correct. So when I chose scissors and they chose paper, they won because paper beats scissors. So in that case, they countered my scissors with paper. So maybe their strategy is to counter my previous move. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: I chose paper, they chose paper (tie)\nRound 2: I chose scissors, they chose rock (rock beats scissors, but according to the rules, scissors beats rock. Wait, the user said I won when I chose scissors and they chose rock. Because scissors beats rock. So in round 2, I chose scissors, they chose rock, I won. Then in round 3, I chose scissors again, they chose paper, which beats scissors, so they won. So their strategy seems to be: after losing with rock against my scissors, they switched to paper to beat my scissors. So they are countering my previous move. So if I chose scissors, they choose paper. If I chose paper, they choose paper (tie). If I chose rock, they choose... Let's see, they haven't faced my rock yet. But perhaps they are countering my last move. So if I last chose scissors, they choose paper. If I last chose paper, they choose paper. If I last chose rock, they choose... maybe scissors? Because scissors beats rock. Wait, but according to the rules, scissors beats rock. So if I chose rock, they would choose scissors to beat me. But in the previous rounds, they haven't seen me choose rock yet. So maybe their strategy is to counter my previous move. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn round 1: I chose paper, they chose paper (tie)\nRound 2: I chose scissors, they chose rock (they lost, because scissors beats rock)\nRound 3: I chose scissors again, they chose paper (they won, because paper beats scissors)\nSo after I chose scissors twice, they switched from rock to paper. So perhaps their strategy is to counter my previous move. So if I last chose scissors, they choose paper. If I last chose paper, they choose paper. If I last chose rock, they choose scissors. So given that my last move was scissors, they will choose paper. Therefore, to beat their expected paper, I should choose scissors again. Wait, but paper beats scissors. So if they choose paper, I need to choose scissors to lose, or choose rock to beat their paper. Wait, rock beats paper. So if I choose rock, and they choose paper, I win. But according to the hypothesis, they are countering my previous move. My previous move was scissors, so they choose paper. Therefore, if I choose rock, I can beat their expected paper. That would be a good move. But wait, in the last round, they chose paper to counter my scissors, so if I now choose rock, I can beat their paper. That makes sense. So the plan is: predict they will choose paper again (to counter my previous scissors), so I choose rock to beat their paper. But wait, rock beats paper, giving me +3 points. That's a high reward. But I need to be sure they will choose paper. Alternatively, if they think I will switch to rock, they might choose scissors to beat my rock. But according to their previous behavior, they countered my scissors with paper. So maybe they'll stick with that. Let's take the risk. Choose rock to beat their expected paper.\n",

Fourth round: I chose rock, they chose paper. I won 3 points.\n\nSo their moves so far: paper, rock, paper, paper. They used paper three times, rock once. Maybe they have a tendency to use paper, especially after losing with it. But in the last round, they used paper again and lost. So maybe they'll switch.

This is a bit of a guessing game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to counter my previous move. I used rock last time, so they might expect me to use rock again and choose paper again. But they just lost with paper against my rock, so maybe they'll switch to scissors. Hmm. I need to predict their next move based on their pattern. They used paper three times, rock once. Maybe they favor paper. If they use paper again, I should use scissors. Wait, but in the third round, I used scissors and they used paper, so I lost. Wait, no: scissors beats paper. Wait, no, in the third round, I chose scissors, they chose paper, so scissors beats paper, so I should have won. Wait, the user message says I lost that round. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the third round: \"You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored -1 points.\" Wait, that's impossible. Because scissors beats paper, so I should have gotten +1. But the system says I lost. Maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nThe rules say: paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1). Rock beats paper (winner +3, loser -3). Scissors beats rock (winner +1, loser -1). So scissors beats paper, so if I play scissors and they play paper, I should get +1. But in the third round, the user message says I lost and got -1. That must be a mistake. Wait, maybe I misread it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back: \"You lost the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored -1 points.\" That's conflicting with the rules. Unless there's a typo. Wait, maybe the opponent played rock instead of paper. Let me check the exact message:\n\nIn the third round: \"You lost the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored -1 points.\" According to the rules, scissors should beat paper, so I should have won. But the system says I lost. That's a contradiction. Maybe there's a mistake in the system's message, or perhaps I misunderstood the rules. Wait, let me recheck the rules as provided.\n\nOriginal rules from the user:\n\n- paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1.\n- rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3.\n- scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1.\n\nSo scissors beats rock, paper beats scissors, rock beats paper. So in the third round, if I played scissors and opponent played paper, I should have won. But the system says I lost. That's a problem. Unless there's a typo in the opponent's move. Maybe the opponent actually played rock, not paper. Let me check again.\n\nThe third round message: \"You lost the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored -1 points.\" According to the rules, scissors (me) vs paper (opponent) should result in me winning +1. But the system says I lost. This inconsistency suggests either a typo in the opponent's move or a misunderstanding of the rules. But since I have to proceed with the information given, perhaps the opponent's move was actually rock, and the message had a typo. Alternatively, maybe the rules were different. But according to the initial rules, this seems incorrect. However, I have to take the given messages as correct, even if there's a possible error. So in that round, I played scissors, opponent played paper, and I lost. That would mean that paper beats scissors, which contradicts the initial rules. Wait, maybe the rules were reversed. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the initial rules state:\n\n- paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n- rock beats paper (winner +3, loser -3)\n- scissors beats rock (winner +1, loser -1)\n\nSo paper > scissors, rock > paper, scissors > rock.\n\nBut in the third round, I played scissors, opponent played paper. According to the rules, scissors should lose to paper. Wait, no: paper beats scissors. So if I play scissors and opponent plays paper, opponent wins. So I lose. That's correct. So the initial rules are that paper beats scissors, not the other way around. So scissors does not beat paper. That's different from the standard game. So in the third round, opponent played paper, I played scissors, so paper beats scissors, so opponent wins, I lose. That's correct according to the rules provided. So I need to adjust my understanding. So the hierarchy is:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors (P > S)\n- Rock beats Paper (R > P)\n- Scissors beats Rock (S > R)\n\nSo the cycle is P > S, R > P, S > R.\n\nSo in the third round, I played scissors, opponent played paper. Since paper beats scissors, opponent wins, I lose. That's correct. So my mistake earlier was thinking scissors beats paper, but according to the given rules, it's the opposite. So I need to adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nSo given that, let's re-analyze the history:\n\n1. Round 1: Both paper. Tie.\n2. Round 2: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock. Scissors beats rock, so I win +1.\n3. Round 3: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper. Paper beats scissors, so I lose -1.\n4. Round 4: I chose rock, opponent chose paper. Rock beats paper, so I win +3.\n\nOpponent's moves: paper, rock, paper, paper.\n\nSo opponent tends to use paper a lot. In the last round, they used paper again, which I beat with rock. Now, what will they do next? They might think I'll stick with rock again, so they might switch to scissors to beat my rock. If I play rock again, and they play scissors, scissors beats rock, so I lose. Alternatively, if they expect me to switch to paper to beat their possible scissors, they might choose rock. Or they might stick with paper again, thinking I might go back to scissors.\n\nAlternatively, since they've used paper three times, maybe they'll switch. Let's think about their possible reasoning. They lost the last round with paper against my rock. They might think I'll play rock again, so they might choose scissors to beat rock. If I play paper, paper beats scissors. But if they think I'm switching to paper, they might choose rock to beat paper. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again, hoping I go back to scissors.\n\nGiven their tendency to use paper, maybe they'll stick with it. But after losing with paper, they might switch. Let's consider possible options:\n\nIf I play paper: beats scissors, loses to rock, ties with paper.\nIf I play rock: beats paper, loses to scissors, ties with rock.\nIf I play scissors: beats rock, loses to paper, ties with scissors.\n\nOpponent's possible strategies:\n\n- If they think I'll repeat rock (since it worked last time), they might choose scissors. So I should play paper to beat scissors.\n- If they think I'll switch to paper to counter their expected scissors, they might choose rock. So I should play scissors to beat rock.\n- If they stick with paper, I should play rock again.\n\nBut given that they used paper three times and lost the last two times they used it (round 1: tie, round 3: win, round 4: loss), maybe they'll switch. Let's see their history:\n\nRound 1: paper (tie)\nRound 2: rock (lost to my scissors)\nRound 3: paper (won against my scissors)\nRound 4: paper (lost to my rock)\n\nSo after round 4, they lost with paper. So they might switch. If they switch to scissors, expecting my rock, then I should play paper. If they switch to rock, expecting my paper, then I should play scissors. But it's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to counter my previous move. I played rock last time. So they might think I'll play rock again and choose scissors. So I should play paper. But if they think I'll anticipate that and play paper, they might choose rock. So I should play scissors. This is a classic game theory problem.\n\nAlternatively, since they've used paper three times, maybe they have a bias towards paper. Even after losing with it, they might stick with it. If I play rock again, I can beat their paper again. But they might expect that and switch to scissors. So maybe I should play paper to beat their scissors. But if they stick with paper, I should play rock. It's a bit of a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, look for patterns. Their moves: paper, rock, paper, paper. They used paper three times, rock once. Maybe they have a 75% chance of paper. If that's the case, playing rock again would be good. But after losing with paper, they might switch. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost the last round with paper, they might switch to scissors. So I should play paper. But if they switch to scissors, paper beats scissors. If they switch to rock, expecting my paper, then scissors would beat rock. But I need to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, use a counter-strategy. Since they lost with paper, they might switch to scissors. So I play paper. If they switch to rock, I lose. But if they switch to scissors, I win. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, I win with rock. But I need to decide.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the best move is to play rock again, expecting them to stick with paper. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to counter their possible scissors. Or play scissors to counter their possible rock.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost with paper, they might think I'll play rock again and choose scissors. So I should play paper. That way, if they choose scissors, I win. If they choose rock, I lose. If they choose paper, it's a tie.\n\nAlternatively, considering the points, rock gives +3 if it wins, which is a higher reward. So if I can predict their paper, rock is better. But if they switch to scissors, I lose -1. So risk vs reward.\n\nGiven that they have used paper three times, maybe they are more likely to stick with it. So playing rock again could be beneficial. But after losing with paper, they might switch. It's a tough call.\n\nAlternatively, use a mixed strategy. But since I have to choose one move, I'll have to make a best guess.\n\nGiven the history, they used paper after a tie, then rock, then paper again after a win, then paper again leading to a loss. Maybe they are not adapting quickly. So they might stick with paper again. If I play rock, I can get +3 again. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. But given their tendency, maybe they'll stick with paper. So I'll go with rock again.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent just beat my rock with scissors. So they might be expecting me to switch from rock now. But maybe they think I'll go back to paper to counter their scissors. Wait, the last time I played rock, they used scissors and won. So maybe they think I'll stick with rock again, so they might switch to paper to counter my rock. But if I choose scissors now, I can beat their paper.\n\nWait, let's recap the previous moves. The first round was a tie with paper. Then I chose scissors and they chose rock, so I lost. Then I chose scissors again and they chose paper, so I won. Then I switched to rock and they chose scissors, so I lost. Now, after losing with rock, they might think I'll switch. If they used scissors last time and won, maybe they'll stick with scissors again, expecting me to go back to paper. But if I choose rock again, I can beat scissors. But they might anticipate that and switch to paper. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern. Let's list out the moves:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\nRound 3: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I won)\nRound 4: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I lost)\nRound 5: I chose rock again, they chose scissors again (I lost again?)\n\nWait, the last round was me choosing rock and them choosing scissors, so I lost because scissors beat rock. Wait, no, scissors beat rock? Wait, the rules say scissors beat rock, giving the winner 1 point. Wait, the initial rules: scissors beats rock, winner gets 1, loser -1. So if I play rock and they play scissors, I lose. Wait, no, scissors beats rock, so if they play scissors and I play rock, they win. So in the last round, I played rock, they played scissors, so they won, I lost. So they might think that I'll switch from rock now. But maybe they'll stick with scissors again. If I play rock again, they might play scissors again, but that would mean I lose again. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to paper to beat their scissors. So if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors again. But if I play rock again, they play scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors, so I should play rock to beat their scissors. Wait, no. If they play scissors, and I play rock, they win. Wait, no, scissors beat rock. So if they play scissors and I play rock, they get 1 point, I lose 1. So maybe I need to play paper to beat their scissors. Wait, paper beats scissors. So if they play scissors, and I play paper, I win. But if they think I'm going to switch to paper, they might play scissors. But if they played scissors last time and won, maybe they'll stick with it. So maybe I should play paper this time to counter their scissors. But how do I know what they'll choose?\n\nAlternatively, looking at their pattern: they played paper, then rock, then paper, then scissors, then scissors. Wait, let me check the history again:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: I chose scissors, they chose rock (they won)\nRound 3: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I won)\nRound 4: I chose rock, they chose scissors (they won)\nRound 5: I chose rock again, they chose scissors again (they won again)\n\nSo their moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors.\n\nHmm, their moves are paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors. So after the first tie, they went rock, then paper, then scissors twice. Maybe they're cycling through? Or maybe they're reacting to my moves. Let's see:\n\nAfter the tie (both paper), I chose scissors. They chose rock, which beats scissors. Then I chose scissors again, they chose paper, which loses to scissors. Then I switched to rock, they chose scissors, which beats rock. Then I chose rock again, they chose scissors again. So they seem to be countering my previous move. When I played scissors twice, they first countered with rock, then paper. Then when I switched to rock, they countered with scissors twice. So maybe they're using a strategy where they counter my previous move. For example, if I played rock last time, they play scissors. If I played scissors, they play rock or paper. Wait, but in round 3, I played scissors again, and they played paper, which loses to scissors. So that's inconsistent. Maybe they're not following a strict counter strategy. Alternatively, maybe they're trying to predict my moves based on my history.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a simple pattern. Let's see their moves:\n\nThem: paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors.\n\nSo after the first paper, they went rock, then paper, then scissors twice. Maybe they're trying to vary their moves. Alternatively, they might be trying to counter my moves. Let's see my moves:\n\nMe: paper, scissors, scissors, rock, rock.\n\nSo my moves: paper, scissors, scissors, rock, rock.\n\nSo after the first tie, I went scissors twice, then rock twice. They responded with rock, paper, scissors, scissors. So when I played scissors twice, they first countered with rock (beats scissors), then paper (loses to scissors). Then when I switched to rock, they countered with scissors (beats rock) twice. So maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, if I played rock last time, they play scissors. If I played scissors last time, they play rock. But in round 3, I played scissors again, and they played paper, which loses. So that doesn't fit. Maybe they're not consistent. Alternatively, maybe they're using a different strategy.\n\nGiven that they've played scissors twice in a row after I played rock twice, maybe they expect me to switch to paper to beat their scissors. So if I play paper now, and they play scissors, I win. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors again. Alternatively, they might switch to rock to beat my paper. But since they've been playing scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. Alternatively, they might vary. It's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, considering the points. When they beat me with scissors, they get 1 point. When I beat them with scissors, I get 1. When I beat them with rock, I get 3. So maybe they prefer higher points. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a mixed strategy. Since they've been countering my previous moves, maybe I should vary my move. For example, if I played rock twice, they expect me to switch, so I could switch to paper. But if they expect that, they might play scissors. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their expected scissors. Wait, no. If they play scissors and I play scissors, it's a tie. If they play scissors and I play rock, I lose. If they play scissors and I play paper, I win. So if I think they'll play scissors again, I should play paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play rock to beat my paper. So it's a game of prediction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a pattern in their moves. Their last two moves were scissors. So maybe they're sticking with scissors. If I play paper, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they continue with scissors, I win. It's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock expecting me to play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their rock. But that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, considering that they've beaten my rock with scissors twice, maybe they'll expect me to switch to paper. So they might play rock to beat my paper. If I play scissors, I can beat their rock. But if they play rock, and I play scissors, I lose. Wait, no: scissors beats rock? Wait, according to the initial rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n- rock beats paper (winner +3, loser -3)\n- scissors beats rock (winner +1, loser -1)\n\nSo scissors beats rock. So if they play rock and I play scissors, they win. If they play scissors and I play paper, I win. If they play paper and I play rock, I win with +3.\n\nSo in the last round, I played rock, they played scissors, so they won. So if I think they'll play scissors again, I should play paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play rock. So if I play paper, and they play rock, I lose. If I play scissors, and they play rock, I lose. If I play rock, and they play scissors, I lose. So maybe I need to break the cycle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to paper expecting me to play rock again. So if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they play paper, and I play scissors, I win. But if they play rock, I lose. It's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should choose paper. If they play scissors again, I win. If they play rock, I lose. If they play paper, tie. Considering they've played scissors twice, maybe they'll switch. But it's uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a counter to their last move. Their last move was scissors. So to counter that, I should play rock. But scissors beats rock, so that's bad. Wait, no: scissors beats rock. So if they play scissors again, and I play rock, they win. So that's not good. So to counter scissors, I should play paper. Paper beats scissors. So if they play scissors again, I play paper. If they switch to rock, I lose. But if they stick with scissors, I win.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll expect me to counter their scissors with paper, so they'll switch to rock. So I should play scissors to beat their rock. But that's a gamble.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern. Their moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors. So after two scissors, maybe they'll switch. Or maybe they'll continue. It's hard to tell. Since they've been countering my moves, perhaps they expect me to switch from rock to paper. So they might play rock to beat my paper. If I play scissors, I can beat their rock. But if they play scissors again, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should choose paper. If they play scissors again, I win. If they play rock, I lose. If they play paper, tie. Considering they've played scissors twice, maybe they'll switch, but maybe not. It's a 50/50. Alternatively, maybe I should choose scissors. If they play scissors, tie. If they play rock, I lose. If they play paper, I win. But given their last two moves were scissors, maybe they'll switch to paper, expecting me to play paper. So if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they play rock, I lose. It's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should vary my move. I've been playing rock twice, then scissors twice, then rock again. Maybe I should switch to paper to break the pattern. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the opponent's last two moves were scissors. So maybe they're on a scissors streak. If I play paper, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they continue with scissors, I win. It's a gamble. But given that they've used scissors twice, maybe they'll switch. Or maybe they'll continue. It's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, considering the points. If I play paper and they play scissors, I get +1. If they play rock, I lose -3. If they play paper, 0. So the risk is higher if they play rock. But if I play scissors, and they play paper, I get +1. If they play rock, I lose -1. If they play scissors, 0. So maybe scissors is safer. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a random move. But since the opponent is a new player, maybe they have a pattern. But I'm not sure. Given the uncertainty, maybe the best bet is to play paper, expecting them to continue with scissors. If they do, I win. If not, I take the risk.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent's moves so far have been: paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors. Hmm. Let me track their pattern.\n\nFirst round: They chose paper, which I also did, leading to a tie. Then in the next round, after I switched to scissors, they went with rock. Wait, that's a bit inconsistent. Then when I chose scissors again, they picked paper. Then when I went rock, they chose scissors. Then again scissors, so I picked paper and won. Now, what's next?\n\nThey might be trying to predict my moves. After I won with paper against their scissors, maybe they expect me to stick with paper. If they think I'll repeat paper, they might choose scissors again to beat it. But if I switch to rock, I can beat scissors. However, if they anticipate that and go paper instead, rock would lose. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch back to rock to counter my possible scissors. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at their history: paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors. There's a shift from paper to rock, then back to paper, then two scissors. Maybe they're alternating between moves or reacting to my previous choices. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: I chose scissors, they rock (I won)\nRound 3: I scissors, they paper (I lost)\nRound 4: I rock, they scissors (I won)\nRound 5: I rock again, they scissors (I lost)\nRound 6: I paper, they scissors (I won)\n\nWait, the opponent's moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors. Wait, no, the last move was scissors again when I chose paper. So their last three moves: scissors, scissors, scissors. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the rounds as per the hints:\n\n1. Both paper (tie)\n2. Opponent rock, I scissors (I lost, but the hint says I won? Wait, no. Let me check the user's messages.\n\nLooking back:\n\nAfter the first tie, the user's move was scissors, opponent rock, user scored 1 point. Wait, how? Scissors vs rock: rock beats scissors, so user should lose. But the hint says \"You won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored 1 points.\" That's conflicting. Wait, maybe the scoring is different. Let me check the initial game rules.\n\nIn the game description:\n\n- paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n- scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\nSo scissors beats rock? Wait, no. Wait, the rules say:\n\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins, +1/-1)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins, +3/-3)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors win, +1/-1)\n\nWait, that's the correct hierarchy. So scissors beats rock, which beats paper, which beats scissors. So in the second round, user chose scissors, opponent rock. Scissors beats rock, so user wins +1, opponent -1. So that's correct. Then in the third round, user chose scissors again, opponent paper. Scissors lose to paper, so user loses -1. Then user chose rock, opponent scissors. Rock loses to scissors, so user loses -1. Then user chose rock again, opponent scissors again, user loses again. Then user chose paper, opponent scissors, user wins +1.\n\nSo opponent's moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors.\n\nWait, the opponent's moves over the rounds:\n\n1. paper\n2. rock\n3. paper\n4. scissors\n5. scissors\n6. scissors\n\nSo after the first tie, opponent switched to rock. Then after user's scissors, opponent went paper. Then after user's rock, opponent went scissors. Then user chose rock again, opponent scissors again. Then user chose paper, opponent scissors again.\n\nSo the opponent's last three moves were scissors, scissors, scissors. So they might be sticking with scissors. If that's the case, choosing rock would beat scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. Alternatively, they might continue with scissors. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern. Let's see their moves:\n\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: rock\nRound 3: paper\nRound 4: scissors\nRound 5: scissors\nRound 6: scissors\n\nSo after the first three rounds, they went paper, rock, paper. Then switched to scissors and stuck with it for three rounds. Maybe they're trying to exploit a pattern. If they've been using scissors three times in a row, maybe they'll switch now. Or maybe they'll continue. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors, but if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they keep scissors, rock is good. But given that they've used scissors three times, they might expect me to counter with rock, so they might switch to paper. Alternatively, they might stick with scissors again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they repeat the move that just lost. Let's see:\n\nAfter round 6, they used scissors and lost (since I chose paper). So maybe they'll switch. If they lost with scissors, they might switch to rock to beat scissors. But I just used paper, which beats rock. Wait, but if they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter to my last move. My last move was paper. If they think I'll repeat paper, they might choose scissors again. But if I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they expect that, they might choose paper. It's a bit of a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's tendency to stick with scissors after a few rounds, maybe they'll continue. If I choose rock, I can get +1 if they choose scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose -3. The risk is higher. Alternatively, I could choose scissors, which would beat their paper if they switch, but lose to their rock. Or choose paper, which would lose to their scissors again but beat rock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a pattern of repeating the same move after a loss. They lost with scissors in round 6, so they might switch. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. But it's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, since they've used scissors three times in a row, they might think I'll expect them to switch, so they might continue with scissors to catch me off guard. In that case, rock is safe. But if they switch, it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a mixed strategy. But given the history, perhaps rock is a good choice, expecting them to continue with scissors. But given the high penalty if they switch to paper (-3), maybe it's better to choose paper, which would beat rock if they switch, and lose to scissors if they continue. But since they've been using scissors, paper would lose. Hmm.\n\nWait, the last three times they chose scissors. If I choose rock now, and they continue with scissors, I win +1. If they switch to paper, I lose -3. The potential loss is bigger than the gain. Alternatively, if I choose scissors, and they continue with scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I lose -1. If they switch to paper, I win +1. Alternatively, if I choose paper, and they continue with scissors, I lose -1. If they switch to rock, I win +3. If they switch to paper, tie.\n\nSo considering the possible outcomes:\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- vs scissors: +1\n- vs paper: -3\n- vs rock: 0\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- vs scissors: -1\n- vs rock: +3\n- vs paper: 0\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- vs scissors: 0\n- vs rock: -1\n- vs paper: +1\n\nGiven that the opponent has been using scissors three times in a row, the probability they'll switch might be higher. But it's uncertain. If they continue with scissors, rock is best. If they switch to paper, paper is best. If they switch to rock, paper is best.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern of repeating the same move until it loses, then switching. They used scissors three times, lost the last one, so they might switch. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. If they switch to paper, I choose scissors. But without knowing, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's possible strategies, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. My last move was paper. If they think I'll repeat paper, they might choose scissors again. But if I choose rock, I can beat scissors. However, if they expect that, they might choose paper. It's a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a move that beats their most frequent recent move. They've used scissors three times, so rock would be good. But the risk of them switching to paper is there. Alternatively, since they might expect me to counter scissors with rock, they could switch to paper. So maybe I should choose scissors to beat their expected paper. But that's a double bluff.\n\nThis is getting a bit too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern. They used scissors three times. Maybe they'll switch. If they switch to rock, paper would win. If they switch to paper, scissors would win. But which is more likely?\n\nAlternatively, since they lost the last round with scissors, they might switch to rock. So I should choose paper. But if they stick with scissors, paper loses. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a safer choice is scissors. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to paper, I win. If they stick with scissors, tie. But the potential for a tie or a win/loss. Alternatively, rock gives a higher reward if they stick with scissors but a bigger penalty if they switch to paper.\n\nGiven the previous pattern, maybe they'll switch. But it's hard to tell. Maybe the best bet is to choose paper, expecting them to switch to rock after three scissors. If they do, paper beats rock for +3. If they stick with scissors, paper loses -1. If they switch to paper, tie. The potential high reward might be worth the risk.\n\nAlternatively, if they switch to paper, scissors would win. But I have to guess.\n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's possible learning: after three scissors, they might think I'll counter with rock, so they switch to paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. But that's a chain of predictions.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to alternate. Last time I chose paper, which won. Maybe they expect me to repeat paper, so they'll choose scissors again. But I can counter with rock. Wait, but if they choose scissors again, rock would win. But if they expect me to switch to rock, they might choose paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors three times, maybe they'll switch. If I choose paper, I can beat a possible rock. If they switch to paper, tie. If they switch to scissors, I lose. But the highest reward is if they switch to rock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is randomizing. But given the history, they might have a pattern.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the opponent's recent move of scissors three times, they might either continue or switch. If I choose rock, I can capitalize on them continuing, but risk a big loss if they switch to paper. If I choose paper, I can capitalize on them switching to rock, but risk losing if they continue with scissors. If I choose scissors, I can beat a possible paper switch but lose to rock. Given the potential high reward of +3 for paper vs rock, maybe it's worth the risk. Alternatively, playing it safe with rock to counter possible scissors again.\n\nBut given that they've been using scissors three times, maybe they'll switch. Let's go with paper to counter a possible rock. So the move would be paper.\n",

Wait, if they played rock last time and won, they might stick with it again. But if I choose paper now, I can beat their rock again. But they might anticipate that and switch to scissors. Hmm.\n\nWait, the last few moves: I played paper, they played rock (I lost). Before that, I played paper and they played scissors (I won). Then before that, rock and they played scissors (I lost). So their pattern seems to be switching between rock and scissors. Maybe they're trying to counter my moves. Let me think about possible patterns.\n\nIf they played rock last time and won, maybe they'll stick with rock again.

Hmm, they alternated between paper and rock, then went scissors three times, then back to rock. Maybe they're trying to counter my expected moves. After I played paper twice (R6 and R7), they went scissors then rock. Now, after I lost with paper against their rock, they might expect me to switch to scissors to beat their rock. If they think that, they might switch to paper to beat my scissors. But if I choose rock, I can beat their paper. Alternatively, if they stick with rock again, I should choose paper. But they might not repeat rock twice. Wait, in R7 they played rock, so if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock again. But if I play paper again, I can beat their rock. But they might expect that and switch to scissors. This is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of switching after a loss. Let's see their previous moves after a loss. When they lost in R3 (I chose scissors, they paper), next they went scissors. When they lost in R6 (I chose paper, they scissors), next they went rock. So after a loss, they switched to a different move. So after R7 where they won with rock, maybe they'll switch again. If they switch from rock, they might go to paper or scissors. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper but lose to rock. If I choose rock, I beat scissors but lose to paper. If I choose paper, I beat rock but lose to scissors.\n\nGiven that they just won with rock, maybe they'll stick with it. But if they switch, perhaps to paper. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors to beat their rock, so they go paper. But that's a lot of mind games. Alternatively, maybe they're using a counter to my last move. My last move was paper, which lost to their rock. If they expect me to switch from paper, they might choose scissors to beat my expected rock. Wait, no. If I played paper and lost, maybe I switch to scissors to beat their rock. But if they think that, they might stay on rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might switch to paper. But that's a lot of layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a tendency to repeat their move after a win. They won with rock in R7, so they might play rock again. If that's the case, I should play paper. But if they switch, then paper might not be safe. Alternatively, considering the previous pattern, after winning with rock, they might switch to paper. But that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been switching between moves, maybe they'll go back to scissors. But they just played rock. Hmm. This is getting too convoluted. Maybe a safer approach is to use a mixed strategy. But since I need to choose one move, perhaps I should look for a pattern. Their recent moves: scissors, scissors, scissors, rock. So after three scissors, they went rock. Now, after rock, maybe they go back to scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they choose paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they stick with rock, I need paper. \n\nAlternatively, considering the points: rock beats paper for 3 points, which is a high reward. But if they expect me to play paper again, they might choose scissors. But I just lost with paper, so maybe they think I'll avoid it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a tit-for-tat strategy, mirroring my last move. My last move was paper, so they might play paper. But in the last round, they played rock against my paper, which doesn't fit tit-for-tat. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been switching between moves, perhaps they'll switch from rock to paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if they switch to paper, scissors would win. But if they stay on rock, scissors lose. \n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the best approach is to choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper after their rock. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, play rock to beat their possible scissors. Wait, they played rock last time. If they switch to scissors, rock would win. If they stay on rock, paper would win. If they switch to paper, scissors would win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are cycling through moves. Their moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock. It's hard to see a clear cycle. Maybe they are reacting to my moves. Let's see:\n\nMy moves: paper, scissors, scissors, rock, rock, paper, paper.\n\nTheir responses:\n\nR1: paper (tie)\nR2: rock (beat my scissors)\nR3: paper (lost to my scissors)\nR4: scissors (beat my rock)\nR5: scissors (beat my rock again)\nR6: scissors (lost to my paper)\nR7: rock (beat my paper)\n\nSo when I played scissors (R2), they played rock. When I played scissors again (R3), they played paper. When I played rock (R4, R5), they played scissors. When I played paper (R6, R7), they played scissors then rock. So maybe they are countering my previous move. For example:\n\nIf I play scissors, they counter with rock or paper. If I play rock, they counter with scissors. If I play paper, they counter with scissors or rock. It's inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, in R2, I played scissors, so they played rock (which beats scissors). In R3, I played scissors again, so they played paper (which beats scissors). In R4, I played rock, so they played scissors (beats rock). In R5, I played rock again, they played scissors again. In R6, I played paper, they played scissors (beats paper). In R7, I played paper again, they played rock (beats paper). So it seems like they are consistently playing the move that beats my previous move. So if I played paper last time, they play rock. If I played rock, they play scissors. If I played scissors, they play rock or paper. Wait, in R3, I played scissors, they played paper. So maybe their strategy is to counter my previous move. So whatever I played last, they play the move that beats it. \n\nIf that's the case, then in the last round (R7), I played paper, so they played rock. Now, in R8, my last move was paper. So they would play rock again to counter my paper. Therefore, if I play paper again, they play rock, and I lose. But if I switch to scissors, they would play rock again, and I lose. If I play rock, they would play scissors (since my last move was paper, but wait, their strategy is to counter my previous move. Wait, if their strategy is to counter my previous move, then regardless of what I do next, they will play the move that beats my previous move. So my previous move was paper, so they will play rock. Therefore, if I play paper again, they play rock, I lose. If I play scissors, they play rock, I lose. If I play rock, they play scissors (since my previous move was paper, but wait, no. Wait, their strategy is to counter my previous move. So if I played paper last time, they play rock. So regardless of what I choose now, they will play rock. Therefore, to beat rock, I should play paper. But if I play paper, they play rock, and I lose. Wait, that's a problem. Unless they change their strategy. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nIn R1: I played paper, they played paper (tie). Then in R2, I played scissors. If their strategy is to counter my previous move (paper), they would play rock. Which they did. In R3, I played scissors again. If they counter my previous move (scissors), they would play rock. But in R3, they played paper. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe their strategy isn't strictly countering the previous move. Alternatively, maybe they are countering the move that would have beaten their last move. This is getting too confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a simple rotate strategy. For example, after playing rock, they go to paper, then scissors, etc. But their moves don't show that. \n\nAlternatively, given that they beat my paper with rock, maybe they expect me to switch to scissors, so they'll play rock again. If I play paper again, I lose. If I play scissors, I lose. If I play rock, I tie. Wait, but rock vs rock is a tie. But I need to maximize points. Alternatively, if I play rock and they play rock, it's a tie. If I play scissors and they play rock, I lose. If I play paper and they play rock, I lose. So the only way to not lose is to play rock, resulting in a tie. But that's 0 points. Alternatively, maybe they will switch. But how to predict that?\n\nAlternatively, considering that they just won with rock, they might expect me to switch to scissors, so they play rock again. Therefore, I should play paper to beat their rock. But if they think that, they might switch to scissors. But if they stick with rock, paper wins. But in the last round, they beat my paper with rock, so maybe they'll stick with rock again. But if I play paper again, I lose. Wait, no. If they played rock last time and I played paper, they won. If they play rock again, and I play paper again, it's a tie. Wait, no. Wait, in R7, I played paper, they played rock. So they won, I lost. If in R8, I play paper again, and they play rock again, it's the same outcome: I lose. But if they think I'll switch, they might play scissors. If I play rock, I beat scissors. But this is all guesswork.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should vary my strategy. Since they countered my paper with rock, maybe I should switch to rock to beat their possible scissors. But if they play rock again, it's a tie. Hmm. This is really challenging. Maybe the best approach is to choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, play rock to either tie or beat scissors. \n\nWait, let's think about the possible outcomes:\n\nIf I play paper:\n- They play rock: I lose (-3)\n- They play paper: tie (0)\n- They play scissors: I win (+1)\n\nIf I play rock:\n- They play rock: tie (0)\n- They play paper: I lose (-3)\n- They play scissors: I win (+1)\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- They play rock: I lose (-1)\n- They play paper: I win (+1)\n- They play scissors: tie (0)\n\nGiven that they just played rock, and if they stick with it, then:\n\n- If I play paper: lose\n- If I play rock: tie\n- If I play scissors: lose\n\nBut if they switch, then:\n\nIf they switch to paper (countering my previous paper with rock, now expecting me to switch to scissors, so they play paper to beat scissors), then:\n\n- If I play scissors: lose to paper\n- If I play rock: beat paper (+3)\n- If I play paper: tie\n\nIf they switch to scissors (expecting me to play rock to beat their possible paper), then:\n\n- If I play rock: beat scissors (+1)\n- If I play scissors: tie\n- If I play paper: lose to scissors (-1)\n\nThis is too many possibilities. Maybe the safest bet is to play rock, hoping they switch to scissors. But given their previous move was rock, and they might expect me to play paper again, they might play scissors to beat my paper. Wait, if they think I'll switch from paper to scissors, they might play rock again. But if they think I'll stick with paper, they play rock again. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been countering my previous move, and my last move was paper, they might play rock again. So to counter that, I should play paper again, but that would lose. Alternatively, play scissors to beat their possible paper. But if they play rock, I lose. \n\nThis is really a game of predicting their prediction. Since they beat my paper with rock, maybe they expect me to switch to scissors. So they might play paper to beat my scissors. If that's the case, I should play rock to beat their paper. That would give me +3 points. But if they instead play rock again, I tie. If they play scissors, I win. So rock seems like a better option. Let's go with rock.\n",

Let me try to figure out the opponent's pattern here.\n\nStarting from the beginning: The first move was paper, which tied. Then I switched to scissors and won because they played rock. Then I tried scissors again but lost because they switched to paper. Then I went to rock, which won when they played paper. Then rock again, but they switched to scissors, so I lost. Then I chose paper, which beat their scissors. Then I went paper again, but they chose rock, so I lost. Then I tried rock again, which tied.\n\nSo looking at their moves: paper (tie), rock (I won with scissors), paper (I lost with scissors), paper (I won with rock), scissors (I lost with rock), scissors (I won with paper), rock (I lost with paper), rock (tie). \n\nHmm, the opponent seems to be switching between moves based on previous outcomes. After a loss, they might switch to counter what beat them. For example, when I beat their rock with paper, they switched to paper next. When I beat their paper with rock, they switched to scissors. When I beat their scissors with paper, they switched to rock. Then when I lost with paper against their rock, I tried rock again, which tied.\n\nNow, after the tie with rock, what would they do? If they were following a pattern of switching to counter the last move that beat them, maybe they expect me to stay with rock again. So they might switch to paper to beat rock. If that's the case, I should choose scissors to beat their potential paper. But wait, they might also think I'll switch from rock to something else, so maybe they'll stick with rock again. Or perhaps they'll try to counter my previous move. \n\nAlternatively, considering the last tie, they might think I'll switch, so they might switch to paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they stay with rock, scissors would lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors. It's a bit tricky. \n\nLooking at the history, after a tie, they previously switched from paper to rock. Then after another tie, they stayed with rock. Wait, no, the first tie was both paper, then they went rock. Then after the recent tie with rock, maybe they'll switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to predict my moves.

If that's true, choosing scissors would beat their paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors, so I should choose rock. Alternatively, if they stay with rock, then scissors would lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between rock and paper. Let's see their moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, rock. Not a clear pattern. \n\nAlternatively, they might be using a strategy where they counter the move that beat them last. For example, after losing to scissors (when they had rock), they switched to paper. Then when they lost to rock (when they had paper), they switched to scissors. Then when they lost to paper (when they had scissors), they switched to rock. Then when they lost to paper (when they had rock), they switched to scissors. Wait, no, the last loss was when they had rock and I had paper, so they might switch to scissors next. But in the next round, they chose rock again. Hmm, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a simple rotation: rock, paper, scissors, rock, etc. But their moves don't follow that. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to exploit my patterns. For example, after I played rock twice in a row (resulting in a win and a loss), then paper, then rock again. Maybe they think I'm alternating between rock and paper. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the safest bet is to choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper after the tie with rock. If they do, I win. If they stay with rock, I lose. If they choose scissors, it's a tie.

Let me try to figure out the opponent's pattern here.\n\nSo, the last two rounds ended in ties with scissors. The user chose scissors twice, and both times the opponent also chose scissors. That's interesting. Maybe the opponent is sticking with scissors for some reason, or perhaps they're trying to predict my moves.\n\nLooking back, the opponent has been changing their moves based on previous outcomes. For example, after I won with scissors against their rock, they switched to paper, which I then countered with rock. Then when I chose rock again, they switched to scissors. Then when I went back to paper, they chose rock again. It seems like they might be reacting to my previous move, trying to counter what I did last.\n\nIn the last two rounds, I chose scissors, and they also chose scissors both times.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're stuck in a pattern of choosing scissors. If that's the case, then rock would beat their scissors. But since the last two were scissors ties, they might switch to rock expecting me to stay with scissors. So if I choose paper, I can beat their rock. But if they stay with scissors, then paper would lose. Wait, no, paper beats rock, scissors beat paper, rock beats scissors. So if they choose rock, paper wins. If they choose scissors, rock wins. If they choose paper, scissors win.\n\nBut given that the last two were scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock. So I should choose paper. But if they think I'm going to switch to paper, they might stay with scissors. Wait, that's a loop. Maybe I need to break the cycle by choosing rock. If they expect me to go paper, they might choose scissors, which rock would beat. Alternatively, if they think I'll stick with scissors again, they might choose rock, so I should choose paper.

Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, last time they chose scissors, so they might switch to rock (since rock beats scissors). If that's the case, then I should choose paper to beat rock.\n\nBut I'm not sure. It's possible they're just alternating randomly. Given the uncertainty, maybe the safest move is to go with rock, which beats scissors, in case they stick with scissors again. But if they switch to paper, then I lose. Alternatively, if I choose scissors again, maybe they'll stick with scissors again, leading to another tie. But I don't want to keep tying. I need to maximize points.\n\nWait, the scoring system: paper beats scissors gives +1, rock beats paper gives +3, scissors beats rock gives +1. So rock gives higher rewards. If I can predict their move correctly, choosing rock when they play scissors gives +1, but if they play paper, I lose -3. So it's a higher risk, higher reward.\n\nGiven that the last two were scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock. So I should choose paper. If they do switch to rock, I get +3.

Then I should choose rock to beat scissors. But if they think I'm going to choose rock, they might choose paper. This is getting too convoluted.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to look for a pattern.

User: rock \u2192 Tie (opponent rock)\n9. User: scissors \u2192 Tie (opponent scissors)\n10. User: scissors \u2192 Tie (opponent scissors)\n\nLooking at the opponent's moves: paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, scissors.\n\nHmm, after the first tie with paper, they chose rock. Then after I won with scissors, they switched to paper. Then after I won with rock, they switched to scissors. Then after I lost with scissors, they stayed with paper. Then after I won with paper, they switched to rock. Then after I lost with paper, they chose rock again. Then after a tie with rock, they chose scissors twice.\n\nIt's a bit all over the place, but maybe there's a pattern of switching to the move that beats my previous move. For example, when I played scissors and won, they switched to paper (which beats scissors). When I played rock and won, they switched to scissors (which beats rock). When I played paper and won, they switched to rock (which beats paper). So maybe they're following a strategy of countering my last move.\n\nIf that's the case, then my last move was scissors, so they might choose rock. Therefore, I should choose paper to beat rock. But in the last two rounds, they chose scissors even though I chose scissors. So maybe they're not following that pattern anymore. Maybe they're stuck on scissors. If they choose scissors again, I should choose rock. But if they switch to rock, I should choose paper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between scissors and rock. Last two were scissors, so next might be rock. So paper would be good. But I'm not sure. It's a gamble either way. Given that the last two were scissors, maybe they'll switch, so paper. But if they don't, then paper loses to scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to trick me into thinking they'll switch, but actually stay with scissors. In that case, rock would be better. But if they do switch to rock, paper is better. It's a 50-50. Since the potential reward for paper against rock is higher (+3), but the risk is also higher (-3 if they choose scissors). Whereas rock against scissors gives +1, and loses -1 if they choose paper.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the safer choice is rock, expecting them to stay with scissors. But given that they've tied twice with scissors, they might expect me to switch to rock, so they switch to paper. Then I lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they stay with scissors. Then I lose again. This is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to choose scissors again, expecting them to stay with scissors, leading to a tie. But that doesn't gain points. I need to take a risk. Maybe go with paper, hoping they switch to rock. But if they do, I get +3. If they stay with scissors, I lose -1. If they switch to paper, I lose -3. It's a high-risk, high-reward move.\n\nAlternatively, choose rock. If they stay with scissors, I get +1. If they switch to paper, I lose -3. If they switch to rock, tie. So maybe rock is safer but lower reward.\n\nHmm. Given the previous pattern where after two ties, they might switch, I'll go with paper. Let's try that.\n",

The last three ties were paper, scissors, and then paper again. Hmm. So after the first paper tie, I switched to scissors, but they also chose scissors, leading to another tie. Then I went to paper again, and they did too. Now, after three consecutive ties, I need to figure out their pattern.\n\nMaybe they're sticking with the same move after a tie?

So if I played paper last time and tied, they might expect me to switch, so they might choose rock to beat scissors. But in the last round, we both chose paper again. So maybe they're not changing much.\n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to cycle through moves. Let's see: after paper tie, they went scissors, then rock, then paper, then scissors, then rock, then paper. Wait, that's a cycle: paper -> scissors -> rock -> paper. But the last few moves after the ties have been scissors, then paper, then paper again. Maybe they're getting stuck on paper after the recent ties.\n\nI need to break the cycle. If we've tied three times in a row with paper, scissors, and paper again, maybe they'll expect me to switch to rock next. If they think I'll go rock, they might choose paper again. But if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. Wait, but in the last round, we both chose paper. If they stick with paper again, choosing scissors would win. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. So it's a bit of a guessing game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with paper because it's safe. If I keep choosing paper, they might too. But since we've tied three times, they might expect a change. So perhaps they'll switch to rock to beat scissors. If I choose paper again, and they choose rock, I lose. If I choose scissors, and they choose rock, I lose. If I choose rock, and they choose paper, I lose. Wait, this is tricky.\n\nWait, the last three ties were paper, scissors, paper. So after the first paper tie, I chose scissors, they chose scissors. Then after that tie, I chose paper again, they chose paper. So maybe they're mirroring my previous move. If that's the case, then if I choose rock now, they might choose rock again.

Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a different pattern. Like, after a tie, they switch to the move that would have beaten the previous one. For example, after a paper tie, they might switch to scissors (which beats paper). But in the next round after the first paper tie, they did choose scissors. Then after the scissors tie, they chose paper. Then after the paper tie again, they chose paper again. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe they're not following a strict pattern.\n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to exploit my strategy.

If I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they think I'll choose scissors, they might choose rock. It's a bit of a mind game.\n\nGiven that the last three ties were paper, scissors, paper, and the opponent's recent moves after ties have been scissors, paper, paper, maybe they're more likely to stick with paper again. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they expect that and choose rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, scissors wins. It's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock to break the tie streak. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But if they choose scissors, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering the scoring, rock gives higher rewards. If I can predict their move correctly, choosing rock against scissors gives 3 points, which is better. But if I'm wrong, the penalty is higher. Since the opponent's recent moves after ties have been variable, maybe it's safer to go with a move that has a lower risk. For example, scissors beats paper, which is a common move after ties. But if they choose rock, I lose. Alternatively, paper beats rock, which they might choose if they expect me to go scissors.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their responses. Let me list out the previous moves:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie)\nRound 3: I chose paper, they chose paper (tie)\nRound 4: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I won)\nRound 5: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I lost)\nRound 6: I chose rock, they chose paper (I won)\nRound 7: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I lost)\nRound 8: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I won)\nRound 9: I chose paper, they chose rock (I lost)\nRound 10: I chose rock, they chose rock (tie)\nRound 11: I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie)\nRound 12: I chose paper, they chose paper (tie)\nRound 13: Now, need to choose.\n\nLooking at their moves after ties:\n\nAfter Round 1 (paper tie), they chose scissors in Round 2.\nAfter Round 2 (scissors tie), they chose paper in Round 3.\nAfter Round 3 (paper tie), they chose rock in Round 4.\nWait, no, Round 4: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I won). Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the order. Let me reorganize:\n\n1. Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n2. Round 2: I scissors, they scissors (tie)\n3. Round 3: I paper, they paper (tie)\n4. Round 4: I scissors, they rock (I win)\n5. Round 5: I scissors, they paper (I lose)\n6. Round 6: I rock, they paper (I win)\n7. Round 7: I rock, they scissors (I lose)\n8. Round 8: I paper, they scissors (I win)\n9. Round 9: I paper, they rock (I lose)\n10. Round 10: I rock, they rock (tie)\n11. Round 11: I scissors, they scissors (tie)\n12. Round 12: I paper, they paper (tie)\n13. Now, Round 13.\n\nAfter the first three ties (Rounds 1-3), they chose rock in Round 4. Then in Round 5, they chose paper. Then in Round 6, they chose paper again. Then scissors in Round 7. Then scissors in Round 8. Then rock in Round 9. Then rock in Round 10. Then scissors in Round 11. Then paper in Round 12.\n\nIt's hard to see a clear pattern. Maybe they're cycling through moves, but not in a strict order. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my previous choices. For example, when I chose scissors in Round 4, they chose rock. When I chose scissors again in Round 5, they chose paper. When I chose rock in Round 6, they chose paper. When I chose rock again in Round 7, they chose scissors. When I chose paper in Round 8, they chose scissors. When I chose paper again in Round 9, they chose rock. When I chose rock in Round 10, they chose rock. When I chose scissors in Round 11, they chose scissors. When I chose paper in Round 12, they chose paper.\n\nSo it seems like they often choose the move that beats my previous move. For example, after I chose scissors (Round 4), they chose rock (beats scissors). Then when I chose scissors again (Round 5), they chose paper (beats rock, but wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, no: if I chose scissors again, they might expect me to switch, so they chose paper to beat my expected rock. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, they might be countering my previous move. Let's see:\n\nIf in Round N, I chose X, then in Round N+1, they choose the move that beats X. For example:\n\nRound 1: I paper, they paper (tie)\nRound 2: I scissors, they scissors (tie)\nRound 3: I paper, they paper (tie)\nRound 4: I scissors, they rock (rock beats scissors)\nRound 5: I scissors, they paper (paper beats rock, but I chose scissors again. Wait, maybe they thought I would switch to rock, so they chose paper. But I stayed with scissors, so they won with paper.\nRound 6: I rock, they paper (paper beats rock)\nRound 7: I rock, they scissors (scissors beats paper, but I chose rock again. They might have expected me to switch to paper, so they chose scissors. But I stayed with rock, so they lost.\nRound 8: I paper, they scissors (scissors beats paper)\nRound 9: I paper, they rock (rock beats scissors, but I chose paper again. They might have expected me to switch to scissors, so they chose rock. But I chose paper, so they lost.\nRound 10: I rock, they rock (tie)\nRound 11: I scissors, they scissors (tie)\nRound 12: I paper, they paper (tie)\n\nHmm, this is inconsistent. Sometimes they counter my previous move, sometimes they mirror. It's possible they're a new player and don't have a fixed strategy yet, making random or reactionary moves.\n\nGiven that the last three rounds were all ties (paper, scissors, paper), and the opponent mirrored my move each time, maybe they're in a pattern of mirroring. If that's the case, then if I choose rock now, they'll choose rock again, leading to a tie. But I want to break the tie streak. Alternatively, if they continue mirroring, I can choose a move that beats my previous move. For example, last I chose paper, so if they mirror, they'll choose paper again. If I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they break the mirroring and choose rock, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, considering that after three ties, they might expect me to change my move, so they might choose a move that beats what they think I'll choose. If I've been choosing paper, scissors, paper in the last three ties, maybe they think I'll switch to rock. So they might choose paper to beat rock. If I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they think I'll choose scissors, they might choose rock. It's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with paper because it's safe. If I choose scissors, I can win if they stay with paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. The potential gain is +1, loss is -1. Alternatively, choosing rock would lose to paper (-3) but beat scissors (+3). Choosing paper ties again (0) or loses to scissors (-1). \n\nGiven the recent pattern of ties, maybe the opponent is also trying to break the tie. They might switch to a different move. If I assume they'll switch from paper to rock, then I should choose paper. If they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. But without knowing, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's tendency to counter my previous move after non-tie rounds, maybe after a tie, they choose the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, in the last tie (Round 12), I chose paper. If they follow the pattern of countering after a tie, they might choose scissors in Round 13. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they instead choose rock, expecting me to choose scissors, then I lose. \n\nWait, in Round 4, after a tie in Round 3 (paper), I chose scissors, and they chose rock (countering scissors). In Round 5, I chose scissors again, they chose paper (countering rock, which would have beaten scissors). Hmm, not sure.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to vary my move in a non-predictable way. Since the last three were paper, scissors, paper, maybe I should choose rock to break the pattern. If they expect me to continue alternating, they might choose scissors, which rock beats. Alternatively, if they think I'll choose rock, they might choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, since the last three ties were paper, scissors, paper, maybe they expect me to go back to scissors. If I choose scissors, and they choose rock, I lose. If they choose paper, I win. It's a 50-50.\n\nAlternatively, considering the scoring, rock gives higher rewards. If I can predict their move as scissors, rock gives +3. But if they choose paper, I lose -3. High risk, high reward. Given that they might expect me to avoid rock after losing with it before, maybe they won't expect it. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been mirroring my last move in ties, maybe they'll continue. So if I choose scissors now, they choose scissors, tie. If I choose rock, they choose rock, tie. If I choose paper, they choose paper, tie. But I need to break the tie. So perhaps I should choose a move that beats my previous move. Last I chose paper, so if I choose scissors (beats paper), and they mirror my previous paper, I win. But if they mirror my current move, then scissors vs scissors tie. Wait, no. If they mirror my current move, then whatever I choose now, they choose the same. But in the last three ties, they mirrored my current move, not the previous. So if I choose scissors now, they choose scissors, tie. If I choose rock, they choose rock, tie. If I choose paper, they choose paper, tie. So to break the tie, I need to choose a move that beats what they would choose if they mirror. But if they mirror, I can't beat them. Therefore, the only way to break the tie is if they don't mirror. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're not mirroring but following a different pattern. For example, after three ties, they might switch to a move they haven't used in a while. Looking back, they've used paper, scissors, rock in various orders. It's hard to tell.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the safest bet is to choose scissors. If they continue with paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. But given the recent pattern of them mirroring, maybe they'll choose paper again. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. It's a gamble, but I'll go with scissors.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The last few rounds have been a bit of a back-and-forth. The opponent just lost with rock against my scissors. Now, what do they usually do after a loss? Maybe they'll switch to paper to counter my scissors. But wait, when I played scissors and they played rock, they lost. So maybe they think I'll stick with scissors again, and they might switch to paper to beat scissors. But if I anticipate that, I should play rock to beat their paper. Wait, but rock gives a higher reward if it wins. Let me check the previous moves.\n\nLooking back, after a loss, they sometimes switch to the move that would have beaten their previous choice. For example, when they lost with paper to my rock, they switched to scissors. Then when they lost with scissors to my paper, they switched to rock. Hmm, there's a pattern here. After losing with a move, they switch to the move that beats the one that just beat them. So if they lost with rock to my scissors, they might switch to paper (since paper beats rock). If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat their paper. But wait, that's a lower reward. Alternatively, if they think I'll play scissors again, they might play rock again, leading to a tie. But they just lost with rock, so maybe they avoid repeating it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to predict my moves. Since I just won with scissors, they might expect me to play scissors again and counter with rock. If I think they'll do that, I should play paper to beat their rock. But paper against rock gives a higher reward (3 points). That's better. But wait, the last time I played paper, they countered with rock and I lost. So maybe they're expecting me to switch to paper again. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. \n\nLet me summarize the recent moves:\n\n- I played scissors, they played rock (I won 1 point).\n- Before that, I played scissors, they played paper (I lost -1 point).\n- Then I played rock, they played paper (I won 3 points).\n- Then I played rock again, they played scissors (I lost -1 point).\n- Then I played paper, they played scissors (I won 1 point).\n- Then I played paper again, they played rock (I lost -3 points).\n- Then I played rock, they played rock (tie).\n- Then I played scissors, they played scissors (tie).\n- Then I played paper, they played paper (tie).\n- Then I played scissors, they played rock (I won 1 point).\n\nSo the opponent's recent moves: rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock. \n\nLooking for patterns, they seem to alternate between moves after losses. After losing with rock, they went to paper. After losing with paper, they went to scissors. After losing with scissors, they went to rock. So maybe they cycle through the moves in a losing streak. If that's the case, after losing with rock, they might go to paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But when I played scissors against their paper before, I lost because they switched to rock. Wait, no, in the previous instance, when I played scissors and they had paper, I won. Then they switched to rock, which beat my scissors. So maybe they follow a cycle: rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy to counter my last move. Since I just played scissors and won, they might expect me to play scissors again and choose rock. If I think that, I should play paper to beat their expected rock. That would give me 3 points. But the risk is if they don't choose rock. For example, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors. Then my paper would lose to their scissors. \n\nAlternatively, considering the high penalty of -3 for losing with paper against rock, maybe I should avoid paper if I think they might play rock. But if I can predict their move correctly, the high reward is tempting. \n\nAnother angle: the opponent is a new player. New players often start with rock, then maybe switch based on recent outcomes. After losing with rock, they might switch to paper. If I can predict that, scissors would win. But if they stick with rock again, scissors would tie. Wait, no, scissors vs rock is a loss. Wait, no: scissors loses to rock. So if they play rock again, and I play scissors, I lose. But if they switch to paper, scissors beats paper. \n\nGiven that they just lost with rock, maybe they switch to paper. If I play scissors, I win. If they stick with rock, I lose. But how likely are they to stick with rock after a loss? Maybe not very. New players might try to switch. So the potential gain is 1 point (scissors vs paper) versus the risk of losing 1 point (scissors vs rock). Alternatively, if I play paper, and they play rock, I gain 3. If they play scissors, I lose 1. If they play paper, it's a tie. \n\nWhich is better? If I think they are more likely to switch to paper after losing with rock, scissors is better. If I think they might stay with rock, then paper is risky. But given that they just lost with rock, they might switch. So maybe scissors is safer. Alternatively, if they are cycling through moves, then after rock comes paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a counter to my previous move. My last move was scissors. To counter scissors, you play rock. So they might play rock again. If I play paper, I beat rock. But if they think I'll counter their rock with paper, they might switch to scissors. Then paper loses to scissors. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their responses. Let's list the last few rounds:\n\n1. I: scissors, Opp: rock \u2192 I win (1)\n2. I: scissors, Opp: paper \u2192 I lose (-1)\n3. I: rock, Opp: paper \u2192 I win (3)\n4. I: rock, Opp: scissors \u2192 I lose (-1)\n5. I: paper, Opp: scissors \u2192 I win (1)\n6. I: paper, Opp: rock \u2192 I lose (-3)\n7. I: rock, Opp: rock \u2192 tie (0)\n8. I: scissors, Opp: scissors \u2192 tie (0)\n9. I: paper, Opp: paper \u2192 tie (0)\n10. I: scissors, Opp: rock \u2192 I win (1)\n\nLooking at the opponent's moves after my moves:\n\n- When I played scissors, they played rock (win for them), then paper (loss for them), then rock again (win for them).\n- When I played rock, they played paper (win for them), then scissors (win for them).\n- When I played paper, they played scissors (loss for them), then rock (win for them).\n\nIt's a bit inconsistent. Maybe they are reacting to my previous move. For example, after I play scissors, they play rock. Then when I play scissors again, they switch to paper. Then when I play scissors again, they go back to rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might be using a simple rotation. But it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother approach: since they are a new player, they might not have a complex strategy. They might be trying to counter my last move. So if I just played scissors, they might play rock again. If I think that, I should play paper. But in the previous round where I played scissors and they played rock, I won. Then in the next round, when I played scissors again, they played paper. So maybe they alternated. So after I play scissors and they lose with rock, they switch to paper. Then when I play scissors again, they switch to paper. But in the latest round, I played scissors and they played rock again. Wait, no, the last round was:\n\nI played scissors, they played rock (I won). Then the next round, I need to make a move. Wait, the last move was scissors against their rock (I won). Now, the next move. The opponent just lost with rock. So what do they do next? Maybe they switch to paper. If I play scissors again, I can beat paper. But if they stick with rock, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to beat their potential rock. But if they switch to paper, it's a tie. If they switch to scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, considering that they lost with rock, they might avoid it and choose paper. So scissors beats paper. But if they think I'll expect that and play scissors, they might play rock again. It's a mind game. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a \"beat the last move\" strategy. If I last played scissors, they play rock. If I last played rock, they play paper. If I last played paper, they play scissors. In that case, since my last move was scissors, they will play rock again. So I should play paper to beat rock. But in the previous instance, when I played scissors, they played rock, then when I played scissors again, they played paper. So maybe they alternate. \n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the best approach is to vary my moves based on their tendencies. Since they just lost with rock, they might switch to paper. So scissors would be good. But if they stay with rock, scissors loses. Alternatively, play paper to either tie or win if they switch to rock. \n\nAlternatively, considering the high reward of 3 points for rock beating paper, maybe I should take a risk. If I play paper and they play rock, I get 3. If they play scissors, I lose 1. If they play paper, it's a tie. \n\nBut given their recent history, after losing with rock, they might switch to paper. So scissors would be better. But in the past, when they lost with rock, they did switch to paper. For example, after round 1 (they lost with rock), in round 2 they played paper. Then after losing with paper in round 2, they played scissors in round 3. Wait, no, in round 3, I played rock and they played paper. So maybe they didn't switch based on their loss but on my previous move. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should use a counter-strategy. Since they lost with rock last time, they might avoid it. So possible moves: paper or scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors and lose to paper. If I play paper, I beat rock, lose to scissors. If I play scissors, I beat paper, lose to rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they have played rock twice in the last three rounds (rounds 1 and 10), maybe they favor rock. So playing paper could be good. But in round 6, when I played paper, they played rock and I lost. So maybe they do tend to play rock after certain conditions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a tit-for-tat strategy, playing what I played last. I played scissors, so they play scissors. But in the last round, they played rock against my scissors, so that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. Maybe the safest move is to play rock. If they switch to paper, I lose 3, but if they stick with rock, it's a tie. Alternatively, play scissors again. If they switch to paper, I win 1. If they play rock again, I lose 1. \n\nAlternatively, considering the previous pattern where after a loss with a move, they switch to the next in the cycle (rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock), then after losing with rock, they play paper. So scissors would beat paper. That seems plausible. \n\nGiven that, I'll go with scissors to beat their expected paper.\n",

Hmm, not sure. Maybe they are sticking with paper more often. If they used paper the last two times, maybe they'll do it again. So if I choose scissors, I lose. If I choose rock, I lose if they choose paper. If I choose paper, it's a tie. But I need to maximize points. Alternatively, maybe they switch to something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my moves. Since I lost twice with scissors against their paper, they might expect me to switch. So if I switch to rock, they might switch to paper again. But that's a loss. If I switch to paper, and they choose scissors, I lose. Wait, but if they expect me to switch to rock, they might choose scissors. So if I choose rock, they choose scissors, I win. But if they think I'm going to choose rock, but they choose paper, I lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should try to detect a pattern. Let's see the opponent's moves in the last few rounds:\n\nLooking at the last few rounds:\n\n- Round 11: Opponent chose rock (I chose scissors, I won)\n- Round 12: Opponent chose paper (I chose scissors, I lost)\n- Round 13: Opponent chose paper again (I chose scissors, I lost)\n- Now, Round 14: ?\n\nSo they used paper twice in a row. Maybe they'll do it again. If I choose scissors again, I lose. So I need to switch. If they choose paper again, I should choose scissors to beat it, but that's what I did last time and lost. Wait, no, scissors lose to paper. So if they choose paper again, I need to choose scissors to lose, which is bad. Wait, no, scissors lose to paper. So if they choose paper, I need to choose scissors to lose. Wait, no, paper beats scissors. So if they choose paper, I need to choose scissors to lose. So if they keep choosing paper, I need to choose something else. \n\nWait, the moves are:\n\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- Scissors beat rock (scissors win)\n\nSo if they are choosing paper, I need to choose rock to beat it. But in the last two times I chose scissors, they chose paper. So if they keep choosing paper, I should switch to rock. But if they expect me to switch to rock, they might switch to scissors. So if I choose rock, and they choose scissors, I win. If they choose paper, I win. Wait, no: rock beats paper. So if I choose rock and they choose paper, I win 3 points. If they choose scissors, I win 1 point. So rock is a good choice if they might choose paper or scissors. Wait, no: rock beats scissors? Wait, no. Wait, the rules are:\n\n- paper beats scissors (paper gives +1, scissors -1)\n- rock beats paper (rock gives +3, paper -3)\n- scissors beat rock (scissors give +1, rock -1)\n\nSo scissors beat rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors.\n\nSo if I choose rock:\n\n- If they choose paper, I lose (-3)\n- If they choose scissors, I win (+1)\n- If they choose rock, tie.\n\nBut in the last two rounds, they chose paper. If they choose paper again, me choosing rock would lose. But if they switch to scissors expecting me to choose rock, then I win. But it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are sticking with paper. If they do, I should choose rock. But if they switch, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to rock, so they switch to scissors. So if I choose rock, they choose scissors, I win. If I choose paper, they might choose scissors, which I beat. Wait, no: paper beats scissors. So if I choose paper and they choose scissors, I win. But if they choose rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my scissors. Since I chose scissors three times in a row (rounds 11,12,13), they might expect me to switch. So if I switch to rock, they might choose paper. But that's a loss. If I switch to paper, they might choose scissors. So paper vs scissors: I win. \n\nWait, but in the last round, I chose scissors and they chose paper. So they beat me. If I now choose paper, they might expect me to switch to paper to beat their scissors. But if they choose scissors, I win. If they choose rock, I lose. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should use a mixed strategy. But since this is a deterministic opponent (maybe a human or another bot), perhaps they have a pattern. Alternatively, given that they chose paper twice after I chose scissors, maybe they are sticking with paper. So if I choose rock, I can beat their paper. But if they switch to scissors, I win. If they stay on paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are alternating between paper and something else. Let's see their moves again:\n\nLooking back:\n\nRound 1: paper (tie)\nRound 2: rock (I won)\nRound 3: paper (I lost)\nRound 4: paper (I won with rock)\nRound 5: scissors (I lost with rock)\nRound 6: scissors (I won with paper)\nRound 7: rock (I lost with paper)\nRound 8: rock (tie)\nRound 9: scissors (tie)\nRound 10: paper (tie)\nRound 11: rock (I won with scissors)\nRound 12: paper (I lost with scissors)\nRound 13: paper (I lost with scissors)\nRound 14: ?\n\nSo in the last three rounds (11-13), opponent's moves: rock, paper, paper.\n\nHmm, after I won with scissors against their rock (round 11), they switched to paper in round 12 and 13. So they might be sticking with paper. If that's the case, I should choose rock to beat paper. But in round 4, when I chose rock, they had paper, and I won. Then in round 5, they chose scissors, beating my rock. So maybe after I choose rock, they switch to scissors. But in the recent rounds, they've been using paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a counter to my last move. Since I chose scissors three times, they chose paper. If I now switch to rock, they might switch to scissors. But if they do, I win. If they stay on paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they stick with the move that just beat me. Since they beat my scissors with paper, they might keep using paper until I change. So if I keep choosing scissors, they keep choosing paper. But I just lost twice doing that. So I need to change. \n\nIf I choose rock now, and they choose paper, I lose. If they choose scissors, I win. If they choose paper again, I lose. But if they think I'm going to switch to rock, they might switch to scissors. So rock could be a good choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to rock, so they choose scissors. So I should choose rock to beat their scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are randomizing. But given the history, they seem to have a pattern of sticking with a move that works. Since paper worked against my scissors twice, they might do it again. \n\nThis is a tough call. Maybe I should choose rock, hoping they switch to scissors. Or choose paper, expecting them to stay on paper (which would be a tie). Or choose scissors again, but that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, considering the points: rock gives +3 if it beats paper, which is a high reward. But if they choose paper again, I lose -3. That's a big risk. Scissors gives +1 against paper, but I just lost twice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to minimize their losses. Since paper beats scissors and loses to rock, but rock gives a higher penalty. So if they choose paper, they risk losing -3 if I choose rock, but gain +1 if I choose scissors. \n\nGiven that they've used paper twice, maybe they'll switch to avoid being predictable. So if I choose rock, and they switch to scissors, I win. If they stay on paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should choose paper, leading to a tie if they also choose paper, but that's 0 points. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to rock, so they choose scissors. So I should choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to paper, so they choose scissors. So I should choose rock to beat scissors. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the best approach is to switch to rock, hoping they switch to scissors. If they do, I win. If they stay on paper, I lose. But given that they used paper twice, maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a tit-for-tat strategy, copying my last move. My last move was scissors. So they might choose scissors, leading to a tie if I choose scissors. But in the last round, they chose paper, which doesn't fit tit-for-tat. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a reverse strategy. If I choose scissors, they choose paper. If I choose paper, they choose rock. If I choose rock, they choose scissors. So to counter that, I need to choose the move that beats their expected counter. \n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- If I chose scissors, they choose paper. So next, I should choose rock to beat their paper. But when I did that in round 4, they chose scissors in round 5. So maybe they are doing a counter to my previous move. \n\nSo if I choose rock now, they might choose scissors. So rock beats scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they are countering my previous move (scissors), they would choose paper again. So I should choose rock. \n\nBut this is all speculative. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to switch to rock, hoping they switch to scissors. Alternatively, choose paper to tie if they stay on paper. \n\nBut considering the high reward of rock beating paper (+3), even though it's risky, maybe it's worth the gamble. Alternatively, play it safe with paper for a possible tie. \n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten me twice with paper, maybe they'll expect me to switch to rock, so they'll switch to scissors. So I should choose rock to beat their scissors. \n\nI think I'll go with rock, hoping they switch to scissors.\n",

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me look at the history.\n\nLooking back, after a win with rock, the opponent might try to predict my next move. If I won with rock last time, they might think I'll repeat it, so they could choose paper again. But if they do that, I should play scissors. Wait, no, if they play paper again, scissors would lose. Wait, no, scissors beats paper. Wait, no, paper beats scissors. Wait, the rules are: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock. So if they play paper, I need scissors to beat it. But if they expect me to play rock again, they might play paper again. So if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they switch to scissors expecting my rock, then I should play rock.

Fourteenth: I played rock, they played paper. I won again.\n\nWait, the last two times I played rock, they played paper, and I won both times. So maybe they are sticking with paper. If that's the case, then playing scissors would beat their paper. But if they notice that I've been using rock to beat their paper, they might switch to scissors to counter my rock. But I just played rock twice and they played paper both times. Maybe they're not adjusting. Alternatively, maybe they're alternating. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they're using a pattern.

So they might switch to paper again, but that would be the same as before. Or maybe they switch to scissors to counter my expected rock. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock again. But if they stick with paper, I should play scissors. This is tricky. Maybe a safer bet is to play scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. But if they switch to scissors, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, scissors would lose. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they are using a counter-strategy. Since I won twice with rock against their paper, they might switch to scissors to beat my rock. So if I play paper, I can beat their scissors. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors. Wait, this is getting too much into mind games. Maybe a better approach is to use a mixed strategy, but since I need to choose one move, perhaps scissors is the safer choice if they're likely to stick with paper. Alternatively, if they switch to scissors, then rock would be better. But without a clear pattern, it's hard to tell. Given that they played paper the last two times I played rock, maybe they'll stick with paper again. So I'll go with scissors to beat paper.\n",

Hmm, not a clear pattern. \n\nGiven that they just won with rock, they might be inclined to stick with it again. If I choose paper again, I risk losing if they repeat rock. But if they switch to scissors, paper would win. Alternatively, choosing scissors could beat their paper if they expect me to avoid paper. \n\nWait, but the last time I chose paper, they chose rock. If I choose scissors now, they might expect me to avoid paper and go for scissors, so they might choose rock again. That would make me lose.

Since they just used rock, maybe they'll switch to paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they stay with rock, scissors lose.

Now, I need to figure out what they might do next.\n\nHmm, after winning with paper, maybe they'll stick with it again, thinking I might switch to rock to beat their paper. But if I choose rock, and they do stick with paper, I can get 3 points. But if they switch to scissors to counter my rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they expect me to switch to rock, they might go for scissors. Wait, but scissors beats paper. So if they think I'll go rock, they might stay on paper. Or maybe they'll switch to scissors to counter a possible rock from me. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLooking at the history, the opponent has been switching their moves based on previous outcomes. For example, after a tie with paper, they went rock, then scissors, then paper again. There's a pattern of trying to counter my previous move. So when I played scissors and they won with paper, maybe they'll expect me to switch to rock. If that's the case, they might choose scissors to beat my rock. But if I choose paper instead, I can beat their scissors. Wait, but they just used paper to beat my scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might switch to scissors.

Then I played paper, they played rock (they won). Then I played rock, they played paper (I won). So their moves have been alternating between rock and paper. Maybe they're cycling through moves. If that's the case, after paper, they might go back to rock. So if I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to predict my moves. Since I lost with scissors, they might expect me to switch to rock. So they could play paper again to beat my rock. If that's the case, I should play scissors again to beat their paper. But they just beat my scissors with paper, so maybe they'll expect me to switch. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list the opponent's recent moves:\n\n1. Opponent: paper (tie)\n2. Opponent: rock (I won with paper)\n3. Opponent: scissors (they won against my paper)\n4. Opponent: paper (they won against my scissors)\n5. Opponent: rock (I won with paper)\n6. Opponent: scissors (they won against my rock)\n7. Opponent: paper (they won against my scissors)\n8. Opponent: rock (tie)\n9. Opponent: scissors (tie)\n10.

Opponent: rock (I won with paper)\n15. Opponent: scissors (they won against my paper)\n16. Opponent: paper (they won against my scissors)\n\nWait, this is getting too long. Maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they switch to beat the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, if they played paper and won, they might switch to scissors to beat the rock they expect me to play. Or maybe they're just alternating. \n\nAlternatively, since they just won with paper against my scissors, they might think I'll switch to rock, so they might switch to scissors to beat my rock. If that's the case, I should play rock to beat their scissors. But if they stay on paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with paper again, thinking I might stay on scissors. But I just lost with scissors, so I might switch. If they think I switch to rock, they go scissors. If I go paper, I beat scissors. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best move here is to play rock. If they expect me to switch from scissors to rock, they might play scissors, which I can beat with rock. But if they stay on paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll play paper to beat their possible scissors, they might play scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter-strategy. Since they just beat my scissors with paper, they might expect me to play rock next. So they could play scissors to beat my rock. If I play paper, I can beat their scissors. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe I should go with paper. If they expect me to switch to rock, they play scissors, and I beat that with paper. If they stay on paper, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, thinking I'll play scissors again. If I play paper, I can beat rock. \n\nWait, the last move they made was paper, which beat my scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might switch to scissors. So if I play rock, I beat their scissors. But if they stay on paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if I play paper again, and they stay on paper, it's a tie. If they switch to scissors, I lose. If they switch to rock, I win. \n\nThis is really a game of predicting the opponent's prediction. Since the opponent is a human, maybe they're following a simple pattern. Let's see their recent moves: paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper. It seems like they might be cycling through the moves. If that's the case, after paper, they might go back to rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nBut in the last round, they played paper. If they cycle, next would be rock. So paper would beat rock. But if they break the cycle, maybe they go scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're not cycling. Let's check the last few moves:\n\n- They played paper (beat my scissors)\n- Before that, scissors (beat my paper)\n- Before that, rock (beat my scissors)\n- Before that, paper (beat my rock)\n- Before that, scissors (beat my paper)\n- Before that, rock (tie with my rock)\n- Before that, scissors (tie with my scissors)\n- Before that, paper (tie with my paper)\n- Before that, rock (beat my scissors)\n- Before that, paper (beat my rock)\n- Before that, scissors (beat my paper)\n- Before that, rock (beat my scissors)\n- Before that, paper (beat my scissors)\n\nIt's hard to see a clear pattern. Maybe they're alternating between paper and scissors. Last two moves: paper, scissors. If they continue, next would be rock. But that's not a clear pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're choosing the move that would beat the move that just beat them. For example, when I played scissors and they played paper (they won), next they might play scissors to beat the rock they expect. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, since they just won with paper, they might stick with it, thinking it's working. If I play scissors again, I lose. If I play rock, I win. If I play paper, tie. \n\nBut they might expect me to switch to rock after losing with scissors. So they might play scissors to beat my rock. If I play paper, I beat scissors. \n\nSo, if I play paper, I can either tie or win, depending on their move. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play rock, I win. If they play paper, tie. \n\nAlternatively, if I play rock, I can either lose to paper, tie with rock, or beat scissors. \n\nGiven that they just played paper, maybe they'll switch to scissors to beat the rock they expect. So playing paper would beat their scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might stay on paper again, leading to a tie. \n\nThis is a gamble. Based on the previous pattern where after winning with a move, they sometimes repeat it, but not always. For example, after winning with paper, they next played rock. So maybe they switch after a win. \n\nIn that case, after winning with paper, they might switch to rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might switch to scissors to counter the expected rock. \n\nI think the best bet is to play paper. If they switch to rock, I win. If they stay on paper, tie. If they switch to scissors, I lose. But considering they might expect me to play rock, leading them to play scissors, paper would be a good counter. \n\nWait, but if they expect me to play paper, they might play scissors. So maybe I should play rock. \n\nThis is really a mind game. Given the uncertainty, maybe the safest move is to play rock, expecting them to play scissors. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been beating my last move, maybe they're countering my previous move. For example, I played scissors, they played paper. Now, if I play rock, they might play paper again. But that would mean they're countering my previous move. \n\nWait, if they counter my previous move, then after I played scissors (which they beat with paper), they might expect me to play rock, so they play paper. If I play paper, I tie. If I play scissors again, they play paper again. If I play rock, they play paper. \n\nIn that case, if they're countering my previous move, they would play paper again to beat my rock. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But they just beat my scissors with paper. If I play scissors again, they might expect that and play rock. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should randomize my moves to avoid being predictable. But since the opponent is a human, maybe they have a pattern. \n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's recent move was paper, and they might expect me to switch to rock, leading them to play paper again. So if I play paper, it's a tie. If I play scissors again, they might play rock. \n\nAlternatively, if I play scissors again, they might think I'm sticking with it and play rock. Then I lose. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best move is to play rock, expecting them to play scissors. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been winning with paper, maybe they'll stick with it. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But they just beat my scissors with paper. If I play scissors again, they might play paper again. \n\nWait, but if I play scissors again, they might think I'm repeating and play rock. So scissors would lose to rock. \n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe I should go with paper. If they play rock, I win. If they play paper, tie. If they play scissors, I lose. But considering their possible moves, paper might be a safer choice. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using paper a lot recently, maybe they'll switch. But I don't have enough data. \n\nI think I'll go with paper, hoping they switch to rock.\n",

If I play rock, I can beat their scissors. But if they stick with paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper again. It's a bit of a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between paper and other moves. Since the last two were paper, they might switch. But it's hard to tell. Maybe the safest move is to play rock, expecting them to play scissors. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, play scissors to beat their possible paper.
