This is a good move to start the game against a fresh player.\n\nRock\n"

Rock has a moderate risk and reward (it can win or lose 1 point, or lose 3 points if the opponent chooses Paper).\n\n4. **Long-term Strategy Consideration:**\n   - Depending on the outcome of the first move, adjust subsequent moves.
