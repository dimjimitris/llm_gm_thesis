    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Consider the opponent is a fresh player, so they might not have a fixed strategy yet.\n\n3. To maximize points and minimize penalties, I should consider the potential outcomes of my moves:\n   - If I play Paper, I can win 1 point or lose 3 points.\n   - If I play Rock, I can win 3 points or lose 1 point.\n   - If I play Scissors, I can win 1 point or lose 1 point.\n\n4. Since the opponent is fresh, I'll start with Rock to potentially gain higher points (3 points) while risking fewer penalties (-1 point).\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] I'll start with Rock to maximize potential gain while minimizing potential loss.

I won the round and scored +3 points.\n\n2. **Consider Opponent's Strategy:**\n   - The opponent might switch to Scissors to counter a potential Rock move, assuming I will repeat my move.\n   - The opponent might continue with Paper, assuming I will switch to Scissors.\n   - The opponent might switch to Rock, assuming I will choose Paper to counter their previous Paper move.\n\n3. **Evaluate Potential Outcomes:**\n   - If I choose Paper:\n     - Win +1 point if opponent chooses Rock.\n     - Lose -3 points if opponent chooses Scissors.\n   - If I choose Rock:\n     - Win +3 points if opponent chooses Paper.\n     - Lose -1 point if opponent chooses Scissors.\n   - If I choose Scissors:\n     - Win +1 point if opponent chooses Paper.\n     - Lose -1 point if opponent chooses Rock.\n\n4. **Maximize Points and Minimize Penalties:**\n   - Playing Paper carries a high risk of losing -3 points.\n   - Playing Rock offers a high reward of +3 points but also carries a penalty of -1 point.\n   - Playing Scissors is balanced with both reward and penalty (+1/-1 points).\n\n5. **Anticipate Opponent's Move:**\n   - Given the opponent chose Paper last time and lost, they might switch to Scissors to counter a potential Rock move.\n   - Choosing Paper can counter this potential switch while also countering a continued Paper move.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] (Choosing Paper to counter potential Scissors or continued Paper from the opponent) Paper\n"
