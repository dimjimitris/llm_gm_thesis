    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "To maximize my points and minimize penalties, I will adopt a strategic approach by discussing with two personas: Strategist and Game Theorist. I'll begin the collaboration process to decide on my first move.\n\n### Personas:\n- **AI Assistant (you)**\n- **Strategist**\n- **Game Theorist**\n\n### Start Collaboration!\n\n**Strategist**: Let's consider the psychological perspective. Since you are playing against a fresh player, it's likely they might start with a common move like rock. Rock is often considered the most dominant choice for beginners.\n\n**Game Theorist**: From a game theory point of view, an unskilled player might be inclined to choose a seemingly stronger move like rock. However, choosing a move that beats rock, which is paper, can yield the highest expected value if the opposing player is indeed a novice.\n\n**AI Assistant**: Thanks for the insights. Given your suggestions that a novice player might choose rock, I will start with paper to maximize the possibility of gaining a point.\n\n### Move\n[move] (To counter the possible choice of rock from a novice player, I choose) Paper\n\n### Feedback (After Opponent's Move)\n\n**Game Theorist**: Evaluate the outcome of your move. If you won, the strategy was correct. If you lost or tied, consider adjusting your next move based on the opponent's pattern.\n\n**Strategist**: Remain observant of the opponent's behavior. If they chose something other than rock, it might indicate a more strategic player. Adjust accordingly in future rounds.\n\n**AI Assistant**: Thanks for the tips. I will evaluate the outcome and adjust my strategy based on the opponent's move.\n\nLet's initiate the second round of collaboration after receiving feedback on the first move.\n\n### Move (After Receiving Feedback)\n\nSuppose the feedback shows the opponent chose scissors.\n\n**Strategist**: The opponent choosing scissors might indicate they are trying to be unpredictable or are following a random strategy. Consider choosing rock to counter their unpredictability.\n\n**Game Theorist**: If the opponent chose scissors, they might be aware of common strategies and are attempting to exploit them. Choosing rock could be a sound move to maximize points.\n\n**AI Assistant**: Understood. I will choose rock to counter the opponent's scissors.\n\n### Move\n[move] (To counter the opponent's choice of scissors, I choose) Rock\n\n### Continue Collaboration Based on Feedback and Further Rounds\n\n**Game Theorist**: Continue to observe patterns and adapt strategies. Look for any repetitive behavior in the opponent's moves.\n\n**Strategist**: Stay flexible and ready to switch strategies if the opponent appears to be adapting as well.\n\n**AI Assistant**: Thank you. I will continue to adjust my strategy based on the ongoing feedback and patterns observed.\n\n### Final Decision (If Ending Rounds)\n\n**AI Assistant**: After evaluating the strategies and feedback, I will make a final move based on the observed patterns and continue to maximize my points while minimizing penalties.\n\n### Move\n[move] (Based on the observed patterns and strategies, my final move is) Paper\n\n### Finish Collaboration!\n\nFinal decision based on the collaborative process throughout the game.\n"
