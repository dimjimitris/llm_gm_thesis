    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Start with a balanced move to gather information.\n\n**Behavior Analyst**: Without prior knowledge, assume the opponent might go for rock or paper, as these are common first choices.\n\n**Numbers Expert**: Since we are starting, the goal is to avoid penalties and gather data on the opponent\u2019s strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the hints and strategies, I'll make a balanced move to gather data.\n\n[move] I choose paper.\n\n### Waiting for the opponent's move result...\n---\n\n### Round 2\n**Strategy Analyst**: Depending on the opponent's move, adjust your strategy. If they chose rock, they might be predictable or cautious.\n\n**Behavior Analyst**: If the opponent chose rock, they might go for paper next. If they chose paper, they might go for scissors.\n\n**Numbers Expert**: Keep track of points and assess which move gives the best chance of winning based on the opponent's pattern so far.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Assuming the opponent went with rock first, I\u2019ll choose scissors to counter paper.\n\n[move] I choose scissors.\n\n### Waiting for the opponent's move result...\n---\n\n### Round 3\n**Strategy Analyst**: Continue analyzing and adapting. If the opponent is unpredictable, consider varying your moves.\n\n**Behavior Analyst**: If the opponent switches frequently, try to stay one step ahead. If they continue with a predictable pattern, stick with countering moves.\n\n**Numbers Expert**: Ensure the choice maximizes potential points, avoiding moves that have consistently led to penalties.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: If the opponent chose paper last round, they might switch back to rock. I'll choose paper to counter rock.\n\n[move] I choose paper.\n\n### Waiting for the opponent's move result...\n---\n\n### Round 4\n**Strategy Analyst**: Based on patterns from previous rounds, choose the move that has the highest probability of winning.\n\n**Behavior Analyst**: If the opponent has been switching every round, anticipate their next move based on their pattern.\n\n**Numbers Expert**: Calculate the optimal move that maximizes points based on the observed pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: If the opponent has been switching every round and chose rock last, they might choose paper now. I'll choose scissors.\n\n[move] I choose scissors.\n\n### Waiting for the opponent's move result...\n\n### Final Decision\nBased on the collective analysis and strategies, the final move for this round is:\n\n[move] I choose scissors.\n"
