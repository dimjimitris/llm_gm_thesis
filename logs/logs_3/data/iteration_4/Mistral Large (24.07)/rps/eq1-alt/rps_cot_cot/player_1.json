    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

No points were scored.\n\n2. **Identify Possible Moves**:\n   - The three possible moves are paper, rock, and scissors.\n\n3. **Analyze the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 point for paper, -1 point for scissors).\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 point for rock, -1 point for paper).\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 point for scissors, -1 point for rock).\n   - Tie results in no points.\n\n4. **Assess the Opponent\u2019s Likely Move**:\n   - The opponent chose paper in the last round, and it ended in a tie.\n   - They might switch to rock to beat a potential paper move.\n   - Alternatively, they might choose scissors to beat paper, assuming I will stick with paper.\n   - There's also a possibility they choose paper again, assuming I will change my move.\n\n5. **Formulate a Strategy**:\n   - Anticipate the opponent\u2019s move based on their previous choices and potential adaptation.\n   - Choose a move that counters the most likely opponent move.\n   - Given the opponent might choose rock to beat paper, choosing scissors would be beneficial.\n   - Alternatively, if the opponent chooses scissors to beat paper, choosing rock would be optimal.\n\n6. **Make a Decision**:\n   - Choosing scissors to anticipate and counter the opponent\u2019s potential move to rock is a balanced strategy.\n   - This choice leverages the past behavior of the opponent and maintains variability in my moves.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] (Choosing scissors to counter the opponent\u2019s potential move to rock) Scissors\n\nBy choosing scissors, the goal is to capitalize on the opponent potentially choosing rock while adding variability to my strategy.\n"
