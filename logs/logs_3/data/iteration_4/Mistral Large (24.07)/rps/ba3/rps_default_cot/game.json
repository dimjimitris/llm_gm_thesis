Consider the mindset of a fresh player:\n   - A fresh player might not have a strategy and could choose randomly.\n   - They might also choose the most intuitive move, which is often rock.\n\n3. Determine the optimal move:\n   - Given that a fresh player might choose rock, my best move would be paper to maximize points if they indeed choose rock.\n   - Paper has a potential win of 3 points against rock, which is the highest possible gain.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] I choose paper to maximize my potential gain against a fresh player who might intuitively choose rock.\n"
