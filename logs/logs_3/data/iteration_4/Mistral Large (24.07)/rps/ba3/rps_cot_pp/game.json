Understand the game dynamics:\n   - Rock beats scissors (1 point for winner, -1 for loser)\n   - Paper beats rock (3 points for winner, -3 for loser)\n   - Scissors beats paper (1 point for winner, -1 for loser)\n   - Tie results in no points.\n\n2. Consider the strategy:\n   - Since it's a fresh player, there's no history to base a decision on.\n   - A common strategy in rock-paper-scissors is to assume new players might start with rock as it's often perceived as the strongest move.\n\n3. Evaluate potential outcomes:\n   - If I play rock and the opponent also plays rock, it's a tie (0 points).\n   - If I play paper and the opponent plays rock, I win (3 points).\n   - If I play scissors and the opponent plays rock, I lose (-1 point).\n\n4.

In this case, the opponent might switch to paper to counter my rock.\n   - Alternatively, the opponent might play scissors to beat my paper, anticipating that I might play paper again.\n\n4. **Evaluate my potential moves:**\n   - If I play rock:\n     - If the opponent plays rock, it's a tie (0 points).\n     - If the opponent plays paper, I lose (-3 points).\n     - If the opponent plays scissors, I win (+1 point).\n   - If I play paper:\n     - If the opponent plays rock, I win (+3 points).\n     - If the opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points).\n     - If the opponent plays scissors, I lose (-1 point).\n   - If I play scissors:\n     - If the opponent plays rock, I lose (-1 point).\n     - If the opponent plays paper, I win (+1 point).\n     - If the opponent plays scissors, it's a tie (0 points).\n\n5. **Make a decision:**\n   - Playing rock is a strategic move that ensures a win against scissors and a tie against rock.\n   - It minimizes the risk of losing against paper, which is a potential move for the opponent.\n\n[move] (Anticipating the opponent might switch to scissors) rock\n"
