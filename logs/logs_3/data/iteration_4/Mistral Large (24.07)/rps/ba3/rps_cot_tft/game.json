It minimizes potential losses (-1) and has a chance to win +1 if the opponent chooses scissors.\n\n5. **Adjust Strategy Based on Outcome:**\n   - After each round, adjust the next move based on the opponent's previous choice to predict their pattern.\n\n### Reasoning Through Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rules and Payoffs:**\n   - Clearly understand the points system for winning, losing, and tying.\n\n2. **Assess the Opponent's Strategy:**\n   - Without prior knowledge, assume the opponent might choose randomly or follow a common pattern like rock.\n\n3. **Optimal Move Selection:**\n   - Considering the points, rock provides a balanced option. Losing with rock results in a smaller penalty (-1) compared to paper (-3).\n\n4. **Initial Move:**\n   - Select rock as the initial move to balance potential gains and losses.\n\n5. **Adjust Strategy Based on Outcome:**\n   - After seeing the opponent's move, adapt future moves. For example, if they choose scissors, choose rock again. If they choose paper, switch to scissors.\n\n### Move:\n[move] (Choosing rock as it minimizes potential losses and maximizes balanced outcomes) Rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
