However, psychological factors suggest rock is statistically the most common opening move.\n\n5. **Make strategic decision**: Since new players often default to rock as their first move (it's psychologically appealing and straightforward), I should choose paper to counter this tendency.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to potentially counter a likely rock opening from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper - betting on the statistical tendency for new players to open with rock\n"
