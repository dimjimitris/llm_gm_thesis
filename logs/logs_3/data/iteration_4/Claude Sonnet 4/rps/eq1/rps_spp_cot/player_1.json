    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "I need to think strategically about this rock-paper-scissors game.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Analyze the game structure**: This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game where each move beats exactly one other move and loses to one other move. The payoff is +1 for winning, -1 for losing, and 0 for ties.\n\n2. **Consider my opponent**: I'm told this is a \"fresh player,\" which suggests they may not have established patterns yet or might be playing randomly/intuitively.\n\n3. **Evaluate optimal strategy**: In rock-paper-scissors against an unknown opponent, there's no inherently superior move since the game is symmetric. However, I can consider:\n   - Fresh/new players often have slight tendencies toward certain moves\n   - Rock is psychologically appealing as it feels \"strong\" \n   - Many beginners default to rock initially\n\n4. **Choose my strategy**: Since many new players tend to choose rock as their first move (it's the first move mentioned in \"rock-paper-scissors\" and feels instinctively powerful), I should choose paper to counter this tendency.\n\n5. **Make my decision**: Paper beats rock, so if my opponent does choose rock (which is statistically more likely for a fresh player), I'll win the round.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the common beginner tendency to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This tells me:\n   - My opponent didn't follow the typical \"fresh player chooses rock\" pattern\n   - They might be thinking strategically too, or got lucky with their choice\n   - They could have had similar reasoning to mine (expecting me to choose rock)\n\n2. **Consider opponent's potential reasoning**: Since they chose paper in round 1, they might have:\n   - Expected me to choose rock (similar to my reasoning about them)\n   - Been thinking one level ahead\n   - Made a random choice that happened to match mine\n\n3. **Think about level-2 strategy**: Now that we've both shown we chose paper, my opponent might think:\n   - \"They chose paper, so they might stick with it\" \u2192 choose scissors\n   - \"They chose paper to counter rock, so they might switch to rock now\" \u2192 choose paper again\n   - \"I should randomize\" \u2192 any move\n\n4. **Consider my best response**: Given the tie, I should assume my opponent is somewhat strategic. Common patterns after a tie include:\n   - Switching to the move that would have beaten the previous move (scissors beats paper)\n   - Sticking with the same move\n   - Switching to rock (the \"default\" move)\n\n5. **Make my decision**: Since there was a tie with paper, and my opponent showed strategic thinking, I'll assume they might try scissors (to beat paper if I repeat it). Therefore, I'll choose rock to beat scissors.\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock to counter a potential scissors play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The natural sequence in rock-paper-scissors is often rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. If we're both following similar logical patterns:\n   - We both started with paper (maybe both expected the other to choose rock)\n   - We both switched to rock (maybe both expected the other to stick with paper or choose scissors)\n   - The next logical move in the cycle would be scissors\n\n4. **Consider level-3 thinking**: If my opponent is thinking \"we both chose rock, so they might choose scissors next to complete the cycle,\" they might choose rock again to beat scissors. But if they think I'm thinking that way, they might choose paper to beat my rock.\n\n5. **Break the pattern**: Since we're clearly mirroring each other's reasoning, I should try to break this cycle. Instead of following the expected rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors sequence, I'll choose paper to potentially catch them if they choose scissors (expecting me to follow the cycle).\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to break the mirroring pattern and potentially beat scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My pattern recognition paid off.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Analyze what just happened**:\n   - I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - My total score is now 2 points (3 wins, 1 loss, 4 ties)\n   - My prediction was correct - they expected me to repeat the paper play from after the first rock tie\n   - They chose scissors to counter my expected paper, but I chose rock instead\n\n2. **Review the complete game sequence**:\n   - Round 1: paper vs paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: rock vs rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: paper vs rock (I won)\n   - Round 4: rock vs scissors (I won)\n   - Round 5: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   - Round 6: rock vs paper (I lost)\n   - Round 7: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   - Round 8: rock vs rock (tie)\n   - Round 9: rock vs scissors (I won)\n\n3. **Observe opponent's full sequence**: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They've now played scissors 4 times, rock 3 times, paper 2 times\n   - After losing with scissors, what will they think?\n\n4. **Consider opponent's psychology after this loss**:\n   - They just lost because they tried to counter-predict me\n   - They might be frustrated that I out-thought them\n   - They could either: randomize more, or try to think even deeper\n   - They might expect me to repeat rock (winner's tendency)\n\n5. **Think about their potential reasoning**:\n   - \"They just won with rock, so they might repeat it\" \u2192 choose paper\n   - \"They out-predicted me, so I need to think differently\" \u2192 could be anything\n   - \"I chose scissors twice in a row and lost both times\" \u2192 avoid scissors\n\n6. **Consider the meta-level**:\n   - I've now won 3 rounds by successfully predicting their counter-predictions\n   - They might realize I'm good at reading their attempts to counter me\n   - This could lead them to either play more randomly or try to counter my counter-predictions\n\n7. **Make my strategic decision**:\n   - If they choose paper (expecting me to repeat rock), I should choose scissors\n   - Scissors is also good if they try to play randomly and happen to choose paper\n   - Given that I've been successful with deeper-level thinking, I'll continue this approach\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors to beat paper, anticipating they'll try to counter my winning rock with paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My strategic thinking is working very well.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Analyze what just happened**:\n   - I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1 point)\n   - My total score is now 3 points (4 wins, 1 loss, 4 ties)\n   - My prediction was correct again - they chose paper to counter my previous winning rock\n   - I'm now on a 2-round winning streak\n\n2. **Review the complete game sequence**:\n   - Round 1-2: ties, Round 3-4: I won both\n   - Round 5: tie, Round 6: I lost, Round 7: tie\n   - Round 8: tie, Round 9-10: I won both\n   - Pattern: I seem to do well when I can read their counter-predictions\n\n3. **Observe opponent's recent sequence**: ...rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - After losing with scissors (Round 9), they chose paper (Round 10)\n   - They're consistently trying to counter my previous winning moves\n   - This shows a clear pattern: they expect me to repeat winners\n\n4. **Consider opponent's current psychology**:\n   - They've now lost twice in a row using this counter-strategy\n   - They might be realizing that I'm anticipating their counters\n   - They could: abandon the counter-strategy, try random play, or go deeper in the mind game\n   - They might be getting frustrated with their losses\n\n5. **Predict their potential reasoning**:\n   - \"They just won with scissors, so they might repeat it\" \u2192 choose rock\n   - \"They've beaten me twice by predicting my counters, so I should randomize\" \u2192 any move\n   - \"I need to break this pattern completely\" \u2192 could be anything\n   - But based on their consistent behavior, they'll likely still try to counter\n\n6. **Think about the psychological momentum**:\n   - I'm winning and confident, they're losing and possibly frustrated\n   - Frustrated players often stick to patterns even when they're not working\n   - They might still choose rock to counter my scissors, despite losing twice with this approach\n\n7. **Make my strategic decision**:\n   - If they choose rock (to counter my winning scissors), I should choose paper\n   - This continues my successful strategy of anticipating their counter-moves\n   - Paper beats rock and maintains my winning approach\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to beat rock, anticipating they'll continue trying to counter my previous winning move despite their recent losses.\n\n[move] paper\n"
