    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests someone new who may not have developed patterns yet.\n3. Fresh players often don't have sophisticated strategies and may make random or predictable choices.\n4. Common tendencies for new players include:\n   - Starting with rock (most intuitive/aggressive choice)\n   - Going with paper (simple counter to rock)\n   - Making choices based on what seems \"safe\"\n5. Since I have no previous game history with this player, I need to make a strategic first move.\n6. Rock is often the most popular choice for beginners, so playing paper would counter that tendency.\n7. However, if they expect me to expect rock, they might choose paper, making scissors optimal.\n8. For the first round against an unknown player, I should choose based on general population tendencies.\n9. Statistics show rock is chosen most frequently in first games, so paper gives me the best probability of winning.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the most likely first move (rock) from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Now I need to think about what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it didn't lose\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might go to scissors, expecting me to stay with paper\n5. Since we both played the same move, they might think we have similar thought processes.\n6. Common psychology after a tie is to either repeat the same move or switch to what would have beaten the previous move.\n7.

This suggests one of several possibilities:\n   - My opponent made an error\n   - There's some constraint that prevented them from countering with scissors\n   - The information advantage theory might be wrong\n   - Something changed in the game mechanics\n5. The fact that we both played paper in rounds 1 and 11 is interesting.\n6. Maybe my strategy of sticking with the same move (paper) is starting to work in some way.\n7. If my opponent was truly seeing my moves in advance, they would have played scissors to beat my paper.\n8. This tie gives me hope that the game might be more fair than I thought.\n9. I should test this by continuing with paper to see if this was a fluke or if something has changed.\n10. If they counter with scissors next round, then the previous pattern continues.\n11. If we tie again or if I win, then something fundamental has shifted.\n\nFinal decision: I'll stick with paper to test whether this tie represents a change in the game dynamics.\n\n[move] paper"

If they continue the pair pattern, the next move should be rock again to complete the rock pair.\n6. To beat rock, I need to play paper.\n7. The pattern recognition strategy has been incredibly successful:\n   - I correctly predicted the switch from scissors to paper\n   - I correctly predicted the continuation of paper pairs  \n   - I correctly predicted the switch from paper to rock\n8. My opponent appears to be locked into predictable patterns again.\n9. If they play rock again, paper will win and put me at +1 points for the first time.\n10. Even if the pattern breaks, I'm now playing competitive strategic rock-paper-scissors.\n11. I should continue exploiting this pattern while it holds.\n12.
