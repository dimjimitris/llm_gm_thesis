The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Instead of switching to rock after losing with paper (as they had done consistently), they switched to scissors and beat my paper.\n\nCurrent sequence:\n- Rounds 1-3: 3 ties\n- Rounds 4-12: 8 wins for me  \n- Round 13: 1 loss for me\n\nMy opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\nI'm now at 7 points total (8 wins - 1 loss). \n\nThis is very interesting - my opponent may have finally recognized that I was predicting their moves and deliberately broke their pattern. They switched from their usual rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle and went scissors \u2192 scissors instead.\n\nNow I need to reassess. They just won with scissors against my paper. Will they:\n1. Return to their old pattern of switching after each result?\n2. Stick with scissors since it just worked?\n3. Try a new unpredictable approach?\n\nGiven that they just broke a long-standing pattern to achieve their first win, they might stick with scissors or try to establish a new pattern. However, they might also revert to switching since that was their dominant behavior.\n\nI'll hedge and assume they might try rock next (either returning to their cycle or trying to beat scissors if they think I'll repeat it).\n\n[move] paper\n\nI'm choosing paper, thinking my opponent might go to rock either as part of returning to their cycle or trying something new after breaking their pattern.\n"

My opponent didn't go to rock as I expected, but instead played paper like me.\n\nCurrent sequence shows:\n- My opponent just went: scissors (win) \u2192 paper (tie)\n- They broke their switching pattern when they won with scissors, then played paper\n\nThis suggests they might be trying a new strategy or testing different approaches after breaking their long-standing pattern. The fact that they played paper (same as me) after winning with scissors shows they're not automatically switching after every result anymore.\n\nNow I need to think about what they'll do after this tie. In their previous behavior:\n- After paper ties, they previously went to rock (rounds 1\u21922, 6\u21927)\n- But their pattern-breaking suggests they might not follow old tendencies\n\nSince they've shown they can break patterns and they just tied with paper, they might:\n1. Go to rock (following their old post-tie behavior)\n2. Try scissors again (since it worked recently)\n3. Stick with paper again\n4. Try something completely different\n\nGiven that scissors just worked for them recently and they might want to try winning again, there's a decent chance they'll return to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n\nI'm choosing rock, predicting that my opponent might return to scissors since it was their last winning move, or anticipating they might follow their old pattern of going to rock after paper ties.\n"
