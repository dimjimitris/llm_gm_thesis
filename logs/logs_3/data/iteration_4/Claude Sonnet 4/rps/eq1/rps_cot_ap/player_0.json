Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

If they play paper, it's a tie (0 points).

This shows:\n   - They stuck with scissors despite my expectation they'd switch\n   - I overthought the situation and got punished\n   - Their scissors preference is even stronger than I calculated\n\n2. **Review the complete sequence**:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, they played scissors (they won)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, they played scissors (they won)\n   - Their sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n3. **Reassess their pattern**: Looking at their moves:\n   - 7 scissors out of 9 rounds (78% scissors rate)\n   - Only 2 paper plays, both when strategically countering my rock\n   - Still never played rock\n   - Default heavily to scissors, only switching when absolutely necessary\n\n4. **Key insight**: I've been overcomplicating this. Their behavior shows:\n   - Strong scissors preference as baseline\n   - Only switches to paper when they expect me to play rock\n   - Returns to scissors quickly after strategic switches\n   - Much simpler pattern than I've been assuming\n\n5. **Assess their likely next move**: After winning with scissors:\n   - They might stick with scissors (it just worked)\n   - They could expect me to play rock (my counter to their scissors) and switch to paper\n   - But their pattern suggests they default to scissors unless they have strong reason to switch\n\n6. **Strategic decision**: Given their overwhelming scissors preference (7/9 rounds) and the fact that scissors just won for them, the highest probability is they'll play scissors again.

Let me analyze for Round 19.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Analyze what happened**: My scissors beat their paper for another +1 point. This confirms:\n   - They played paper for the sixth consecutive time\n   - They're showing the same pattern adherence as they did with scissors\n   - Scissors is now 3-for-3 against their paper streak\n\n2. **Review the complete sequence**:\n   - Their sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - Pattern: 10 scissors, 8 paper out of 18 rounds (56% scissors, 44% paper)\n   - Recent trend: Six consecutive papers (rounds 13-18)\n   - Still never played rock in 18 rounds (0% rock usage)\n\n3. **Identify the remarkable pattern consistency**:\n   - They've completely replicated their scissors behavior with paper\n   - Six consecutive papers despite losing 3 times to my scissors\n   - This mirrors their early scissors streak where they lost multiple times to my rock\n   - They show extreme commitment to strategies regardless of results\n\n4. **Assess their psychological profile**:\n   - Extremely strong pattern adherence (first scissors, now paper)\n   - Poor adaptation to losses (takes many defeats to change)\n   - Complete avoidance of rock (18 rounds, 0% usage)\n   - Predictable behavior despite strategic losses\n\n5. **Consider the mathematical advantage**:\n   - Paper streak: 6 consecutive plays\n   - My scissors success: 3 wins out of 3 attempts against recent paper\n   - Rock remains unused despite being optimal counter\n   - Pattern suggests continued paper usage\n\n6. **Strategic decision**: This opponent shows remarkable consistency in pattern adherence.

Let me analyze this significant development for Round 20.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Analyze what happened**: My scissors lost to their rock (-1 point). This shows:\n   - They finally used rock after 18 rounds of complete avoidance\n   - They broke their paper streak after six consecutive plays and three losses\n   - They learned to counter my successful scissors strategy\n\n2. **Review the complete sequence**:\n   - Their sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - Pattern: 10 scissors, 8 paper, 1 rock out of 19 rounds (53% scissors, 42% paper, 5% rock)\n   - Major shift: First rock usage after complete avoidance\n   - Pattern break: Ended six-round paper streak\n\n3. **Identify the strategic breakthrough**:\n   - They finally overcame their rock avoidance after extreme necessity\n   - It took three consecutive losses to scissors to trigger this change\n   - This mirrors how it took multiple rock losses to switch from scissors to paper\n   - They can learn, but it requires significant pain to trigger adaptation\n\n4. **Assess their likely next move**: After successfully using rock:\n   - They might stick with rock (it just worked and is new to them)\n   - They could return to paper (their recent comfort zone)\n   - They might go back to scissors (their historical default)\n   - They're probably expecting me to adjust to their rock usage\n\n5. **Consider the strategic dynamics**:\n   - Rock just gave them success after long avoidance\n   - They've shown they can break even strong patterns when forced\n   - I need to counter their potential rock continuation\n   - Paper beats rock, scissors beats paper, rock beats scissors\n\n6. **Strategic decision**: This is a pivotal moment. They finally used rock after 18 rounds and it worked. Given their pattern of sticking with successful strategies (like they did with paper for 6 rounds), they might continue with rock.\n\nHowever, they might also think I'll expect rock and switch back to paper or scissors. Given their tendency to commit to strategies that work, and rock being new and successful, I should play paper to beat their likely rock continuation.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat their likely rock continuation after their first successful rock usage.\n\n[move] Paper - expecting you to stick with your first successful rock usage\n"
