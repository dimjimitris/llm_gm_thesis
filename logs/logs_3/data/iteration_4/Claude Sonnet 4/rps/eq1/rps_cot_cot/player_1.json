    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This could mean:\n   - They had similar reasoning to mine (expecting rock from a \"fresh player\")\n   - They might have a preference for paper\n   - They could be thinking strategically like me\n\n3. **Consider opponent's next move**: Now that we both played paper, they know I played paper too. They might:\n   - Stick with paper if they think it's a good choice\n   - Switch to scissors to beat paper (thinking I might repeat)\n   - Switch to rock for variety\n   - Try to think what I'm thinking (meta-game)\n\n4. **Evaluate my options**:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors\n   - If they switch to scissors (expecting me to repeat paper): I should play rock\n   - If they switch to rock: I should play paper\n\n5. **Strategic reasoning**: Since we both chose paper last time, there's a psychological tendency for players to either repeat a tied move or switch to counter it. Many players will switch to scissors expecting the opponent to repeat paper.\n\n6. **Make decision**: I'll play rock to counter the likely scissors choice, as it's common for players to play scissors after a paper tie.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter a likely scissors response.\n\n[move] Rock - expecting opponent might switch to scissors to beat my previous paper choice\n"
