    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the opponent's clear strategy:\n   - They choose scissors EVERY TIME I choose paper (rounds 5, 7, 9)\n   - They choose rock when I don't choose paper\n   - This is a predictable counter-strategy: they're reading my paper moves perfectly\n\n3. Recognize the exploitable pattern:\n   - They expect me to continue using paper (since it theoretically beats their rock tendency)\n   - They counter with scissors every single time I use paper\n   - This is now a 100% predictable response\n\n4. Develop the winning counter-strategy:\n   - Since they will choose scissors if they think I'll choose paper\n   - And they've chosen scissors the last 3 times I chose paper\n   - I should choose rock to beat their scissors\n\n5. Execute the exploitation:\n   - They're locked into this counter-pattern\n   - Rock beats scissors, giving me +1 point\n   - This breaks their successful strategy against me\n\n6. Make my decision:\n   - Choose rock to exploit their predictable scissors response\n\n[move] (They've chosen scissors every single time I've played paper - I'll exploit this predictable pattern with rock) rock"

Analyze the opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: rock  \n   - Round 19: scissors\n   - They switched from rock to scissors right when I chose paper\n\n3. Examine the strategic implications:\n   - I chose paper expecting them to continue with rock\n   - They chose scissors, which beats paper\n   - This suggests they predicted I would choose paper to counter their rock pattern\n\n4. Look at the meta-game pattern:\n   - This opponent consistently adapts just when I think I've figured them out\n   - They seem to be one step ahead in reading my logical responses\n   - When I expect rock, they choose scissors; when I expect scissors, they choose rock\n\n5. Consider their level of play:\n   - They appear to be thinking about what I'm thinking\n   - They're using counter-prediction rather than fixed patterns\n   - I need to be less predictable in my own reasoning\n\n6. Make a less obvious choice:\n   - Instead of trying to counter what I think they'll do, I should choose more randomly\n   - Rock is a safe, neutral choice that doesn't follow obvious logic from recent rounds\n   - It also counters scissors if they expect me to repeat paper or choose scissors myself\n\n[move] (They keep successfully counter-predicting my logical moves - I'll choose rock to be less predictable) rock"

Recognize the strategic problem:\n   - I keep trying to find patterns and counter them logically\n   - The opponent appears to be reading my logical processes\n   - Every time I think I've found their pattern, they change it\n\n4. Consider a different approach:\n   - Instead of over-analyzing, I should make a more intuitive choice\n   - Randomness might be more effective than logic against this opponent\n   - I should avoid choices that seem \"obvious\" based on recent history\n\n5. Evaluate my options without over-thinking:\n   - Rock: just tied with this, might seem predictable to repeat\n   - Paper: lost with this recently when they chose scissors\n   - Scissors: lost with this recently when they chose rock\n\n6. Make an intuitive decision:\n   - I'll choose scissors, not because of logical reasoning, but because it feels like the right time to break away from rock/paper focus\n   - Sometimes the best strategy against a counter-predictor is to make choices that don't follow clear logic\n\n[move] (Against this adaptive opponent, I'll make a more intuitive choice rather than over-analyzing - going with scissors) scissors"

Analyze what just occurred:\n   - I chose scissors based on intuition rather than logical pattern analysis\n   - The opponent chose paper, which my scissors beat\n   - This broke their recent successful counter-prediction streak\n\n3. Examine the opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 19: scissors\n   - Round 20: rock\n   - Round 21: paper\n   - They've now used all three moves in consecutive rounds\n\n4.

Evaluate the strategic lesson:\n   - Against highly adaptive opponents, pure logic can become a weakness\n   - Mixing intuitive and analytical thinking might be optimal\n   - I should avoid falling back into over-analysis patterns\n\n6. Make my next decision:\n   - I won't try to analyze what they'll do based on their paper choice\n   - I'll make another somewhat intuitive choice\n   - Rock feels right - it's solid, doesn't overthink the situation, and covers multiple possibilities\n\n[move] (The intuitive approach just worked - I'll continue with a straightforward choice and go with rock) rock"
