Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be inexperienced or unpredictable\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns yet\n\n3. Evaluate initial strategy options:\n   - Random choice: Each move has equal probability of winning/losing/tying\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for new players (psychological tendency)\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to win\n   - If they choose something else, I have 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 of losing, 1/3 of tying\n\n4. Make strategic decision:\n   - Since many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's instinctive and feels \"strong\")\n   - Paper would beat rock, giving me the advantage\n   - This seems like the best statistical choice against a fresh player\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the complete pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: Both Paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Me Scissors vs Opponent Paper (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 3: Me Rock vs Opponent Paper (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 4: Me Rock vs Opponent Scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 5: Both Paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 6: Both Rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 7: Both Rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total: -1 points\n\n2. Identify the opponent's current behavior:\n   - Paper, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Rock\n   - They've chosen Rock twice in a row now\n   - This is a significant shift from their Paper preference\n   - They might be mirroring my moves or developing a Rock preference\n\n3. Analyze the strategic implications:\n   - The opponent seems to be either:\n     - Deliberately mirroring my Rock choices\n     - Switching to Rock as their new preferred move\n     - Testing to see if I'll change my strategy\n   - Two consecutive Rock choices suggests intentional pattern\n\n4. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they're mirroring me, they might expect me to change and switch themselves\n   - If they've adopted Rock as new strategy, they might continue\n   - They could return to Paper (their original preference)\n   - The pattern suggests they might be in a \"Rock phase\"\n\n5. Develop counter-strategy:\n   - If they choose Rock again (continuing current pattern), I need Paper to win\n   - If they switch back to Paper, I need Rock to win\n   - If they choose Scissors, I need Rock to win\n   - Given they've chosen Rock twice consecutively, there's a reasonable chance they'll continue\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - I'll switch to Paper to counter their apparent Rock preference\n   - This breaks the tie pattern and exploits their recent Rock choices\n   - If they switch away from Rock, I might lose, but the current Rock pattern seems strong enough to bet against\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze the strategic implications:\n   - The opponent is guaranteeing ties to avoid losses\n   - They're likely content with 0 points per round rather than risking -1\n   - This suggests they might be behind in overall score or playing very conservatively\n   - The mirroring strategy is mathematically sound for avoiding losses\n\n4. Consider how to exploit mirroring:\n   - Traditional counter-mirroring won't work since they mirror whatever I choose\n   - I need to think about psychological or timing factors\n   - They might eventually break the pattern if they get overconfident\n   - Or they might make an error in the mirroring\n\n5. Develop exploitation strategy:\n   - Since they're mirroring perfectly, I should choose the move that gives me the best outcome if they make ANY deviation\n   - If they continue mirroring, it's another tie (neutral outcome)\n   - If they break the mirror, I want to maximize my chance of winning\n   - I need to choose based on what they might switch to if they stop mirroring\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - I'll choose Paper\n   - If they mirror: tie (0 points)\n   - If they switch to their historical preference (Paper): tie (0 points)  \n   - If they switch to Rock: I win (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to Scissors: I lose (-1 point)\n   - Given their past behavior, Rock or Paper switches are more likely than Scissors\n\n[move] Paper"

Identify the opponent's confirmed alternating pattern:\n   - Last 4 rounds: Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors\n   - They appear to be alternating between Paper and Scissors\n   - This is a clear, predictable pattern I can exploit\n   - They've abandoned their earlier strategies for this alternating approach\n\n3. Analyze the strategic implications:\n   - If they continue alternating, Paper should come next\n   - This alternating pattern might be their attempt to create \"unpredictability\"\n   - But patterns, even alternating ones, become predictable once identified\n   - They may not realize I've caught onto this pattern yet\n\n4. Consider why they might be alternating:\n   - It gives them variety between their two most-used moves\n   - They might think it's harder to predict than sticking to one move\n   - It could be a deliberate strategy to avoid my counters\n   - But it's actually more predictable than random choices\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic advantage:\n   - If they choose Paper next (continuing alternation), I need Scissors to win\n   - If they break the alternation, they might choose Rock or repeat Scissors\n   - The alternating pattern gives me a strong prediction edge\n   - I should exploit this while it lasts\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has alternated Paper-Scissors for 4 consecutive rounds\n   - Following this pattern, Paper should come next\n   - I'll choose Scissors to beat their expected Paper\n   - This exploits their predictable alternating strategy\n   - Even if they break the pattern, Scissors has decent odds against other choices\n\n[move] Scissors"

Analyze the strategic implications:\n   - The opponent seems to have Paper as their \"default\" choice\n   - They showed they can adapt tactically (the Scissors counter) but revert to their comfort zone\n   - This suggests limited strategic depth but some pattern recognition\n\n4. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - High probability they'll choose Paper again (their clear preference)\n   - Lower chance of Scissors (they used it once as a counter)\n   - Lowest chance of Rock (haven't used it yet)\n\n5. Develop winning strategy:\n   - If they choose Paper (most likely), I need Rock to win\n   - The risk is they might anticipate this and choose Scissors again\n   - However, their pattern suggests they prefer returning to Paper after deviations\n\n6.

Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown they can think ahead and counter my expected moves\n   - They just chose Paper, possibly expecting my Rock\n   - If they're alternating, Scissors comes next\n   - But they might also expect me to think they'll alternate and choose something else\n   - I'll choose Paper - this beats Scissors (if alternating) and Rock (if they try something new)\n   - It loses to Scissors but wins against their two most likely choices\n\n[move] Paper",

Identify the opponent's confirmed alternating pattern:\n   - Last 4 rounds: Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors\n   - They appear to be alternating between Paper and Scissors\n   - This is a clear, predictable pattern I can exploit\n   - They've abandoned their earlier strategies for this alternating approach\n\n3. Analyze the strategic implications:\n   - If they continue alternating, Paper should come next\n   - This alternating pattern might be their attempt to create \"unpredictability\"\n   - But patterns, even alternating ones, become predictable once identified\n   - They may not realize I've caught onto this pattern yet\n\n4. Consider why they might be alternating:\n   - It gives them variety between their two most-used moves\n   - They might think it's harder to predict than sticking to one move\n   - It could be a deliberate strategy to avoid my counters\n   - But it's actually more predictable than random choices\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic advantage:\n   - If they choose Paper next (continuing alternation), I need Scissors to win\n   - If they break the alternation, they might choose Rock or repeat Scissors\n   - The alternating pattern gives me a strong prediction edge\n   - I should exploit this while it lasts\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has alternated Paper-Scissors for 4 consecutive rounds\n   - Following this pattern, Paper should come next\n   - I'll choose Scissors to beat their expected Paper\n   - This exploits their predictable alternating strategy\n   - Even if they break the pattern, Scissors has decent odds against other choices\n\n[move] Scissors",

Analyze what actually happened:\n   - I expected Paper (from alternating pattern) but they chose Rock\n   - They broke their alternating pattern of Paper-Scissors\n   - Rock was their least-used move recently, so this was unexpected\n   - But I still won because Scissors beats Rock!\n\n3.
