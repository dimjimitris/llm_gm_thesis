    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Develop an opening strategy:\n   - Since I have no information about opponent patterns, each move has equal probability of winning\n   - Rock is often considered a \"default\" choice by new players\n   - However, this could be overthinking - the opponent might choose randomly\n\n4. Make a strategic first move:\n   - I'll choose Paper as my opening move\n   - If the opponent chooses Rock (common beginner choice), I win\n   - If they choose Scissors, I lose\n   - If they choose Paper, it's a tie\n   - This gives me a reasonable chance of success\n\n[move] Paper"

Develop strategy for Round 2:\n   - If the opponent sticks with Paper again, I need to choose Scissors to win\n   - If they switch expecting me to repeat Paper, they might choose Scissors, so I should choose Rock\n   - If they think I'll counter their Paper with Scissors, they might choose Rock, so I should choose Paper again\n\n4.

Confirm the mirroring strategy:\n   - Rounds 6-10: Perfect mirroring for 5 consecutive rounds\n   - Rock, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock - exactly matching my sequence\n   - This is clearly intentional, not coincidental\n   - The opponent has adopted a pure mirroring defense strategy\n\n3. Analyze the strategic implications:\n   - The opponent is guaranteeing ties to avoid losses\n   - They're likely content with 0 points per round rather than risking -1\n   - This suggests they might be behind in overall score or playing very conservatively\n   - The mirroring strategy is mathematically sound for avoiding losses\n\n4. Consider how to exploit mirroring:\n   - Traditional counter-mirroring won't work since they mirror whatever I choose\n   - I need to think about psychological or timing factors\n   - They might eventually break the pattern if they get overconfident\n   - Or they might make an error in the mirroring\n\n5. Develop exploitation strategy:\n   - Since they're mirroring perfectly, I should choose the move that gives me the best outcome if they make ANY deviation\n   - If they continue mirroring, it's another tie (neutral outcome)\n   - If they break the mirror, I want to maximize my chance of winning\n   - I need to choose based on what they might switch to if they stop mirroring\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - I'll choose Paper\n   - If they mirror: tie (0 points)\n   - If they switch to their historical preference (Paper): tie (0 points)  \n   - If they switch to Rock: I win (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to Scissors: I lose (-1 point)\n   - Given their past behavior, Rock or Paper switches are more likely than Scissors\n\n[move] Paper"

Understand why the opponent broke the mirror:\n   - They might have gotten bored with constant ties\n   - They could be trying to surprise me after establishing the mirroring pattern\n   - They might have thought I'd expect mirroring and chose to counter-attack\n   - Scissors would beat Rock if they expected me to repeat my previous Rock\n\n4. Consider the opponent's current mindset:\n   - They just lost after a long string of ties\n   - They might return to mirroring for safety\n   - They could try another surprise move\n   - They might revert to their historical Paper preference\n   - The Scissors choice shows they're willing to take risks again\n\n5. Develop strategy for Round 12:\n   - If they return to mirroring, they'll choose whatever I choose (tie)\n   - If they stick with Scissors, I need Rock to win\n   - If they return to Paper (historical preference), I need Scissors to win\n   - If they choose Rock, I need Paper to win\n\n6.

Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just chose Paper and we tied\n   - They have a strong historical preference for Paper\n   - After experimenting with patterns and Rock, they returned to Paper\n   - This suggests Paper is their \"default\" when uncertain\n   - I'll choose Scissors to beat their likely Paper choice\n   - This exploits their apparent Paper preference and comfort zone\n\n[move] Scissors"

Analyze the current situation:\n   - Round 19: Both Paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 20: Both Scissors (tie, 0 points)  \n   - Current total: +3 points (still maintaining my lead)\n\n2. Review the opponent's recent moves:\n   - Last 6 rounds: Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors\n   - They've now used all three moves in recent rounds\n   - They seem to be cycling through their options more unpredictably\n   - No clear single pattern, but Paper and Scissors remain dominant\n\n3. Analyze the opponent's strategic evolution:\n   - They're becoming increasingly adaptive and harder to predict\n   - They can break patterns, return to comfort zones, and switch again\n   - The recent ties suggest they might be reading my moves well\n   - They're showing sophisticated counter-play\n\n4. Consider the meta-strategic situation:\n   - We've had several ties recently, suggesting we're both adapting well\n   - The opponent might be trying to force ties to prevent me from extending my lead\n   - They could be playing more defensively now\n   - Or they might be setting up for a pattern I haven't recognized yet\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I'm ahead by +3 points, which is a good lead\n   - Recent ties aren't hurting me as much as they're preventing gains\n   - I need to focus on breaking their defensive/adaptive play\n   - I should consider what they might NOT expect\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just chose Scissors after choosing Paper in the previous round\n   - They might continue with Scissors, return to Paper, or try Rock\n   - Given their recent adaptability, they might expect me to try Rock (to beat Scissors)\n   - But they could also stick with Scissors since it just worked for a tie\n   - I'll choose Rock to beat Scissors, betting they'll stick with their current choice\n   - This breaks the tie pattern and exploits if they repeat Scissors\n\n[move] Rock"

Verify the game rules and result:\n   - I chose Rock, opponent chose Scissors\n   - Rule: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So Scissors beats Rock, meaning the opponent won and I lost\n   - I correctly lost -1 point\n\n2. Analyze what happened:\n   - I predicted they might stick with Scissors and chose Rock to counter\n   - But I had the rule backwards - Scissors beats Rock, not the other way around\n   - The opponent did stick with Scissors as I predicted, but I chose the wrong counter\n   - I should have chosen Paper to beat Scissors\n\n3. Update the current situation:\n   - Round 19: Both Paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 20: Both Scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 21: Me Rock vs Opponent Scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Current total: +2 points (still ahead but lead reduced)\n\n4. Analyze the opponent's pattern:\n   - They chose Scissors twice in a row (rounds 20-21)\n   - This could be the start of a new Scissors streak\n   - Or they might switch after winning with Scissors\n   - They've shown they can stick with winning moves\n\n5. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They just won with Scissors, so might stick with it\n   - They could switch to avoid being predictable\n   - Paper and Rock are both options\n   - Given they won, there's psychological incentive to repeat Scissors\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just won with Scissors and might repeat it\n   - If they choose Scissors again, I need Paper to win (Paper beats Scissors)\n   - If they switch to Paper, I need Scissors to win\n   - If they switch to Rock, I need Paper to win\n   - Paper covers two of the three possibilities and beats their most likely choice\n   - I'll choose Paper to beat their likely Scissors repeat\n\n[move] Paper"

Identify the opponent's current pattern:\n   - Last 4 rounds: Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors\n   - They've chosen Scissors three times in a row now (rounds 20-22)\n   - This is similar to their earlier Scissors streak (rounds 11-13)\n   - They seem to go through phases where they stick with one move\n\n3. Analyze the opponent's strategic behavior:\n   - They tend to find a move and stick with it for multiple rounds\n   - First it was Paper (early rounds), then mirroring, then Scissors streaks\n   - Even after losing with Scissors in round 22, they might continue the streak\n   - Or they might switch after the loss\n\n4. Consider their psychological state:\n   - They just lost after winning the previous round\n   - They might abandon Scissors after the loss\n   - Or they might double down and try Scissors again\n   - Their history suggests they stick with moves even through losses\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Scissors (streak pattern), I need Paper to win\n   - If they switch to Paper (their historical favorite), I need Scissors to win\n   - If they switch to Rock, I need Paper to win\n   - Given their tendency for streaks, Scissors seems most likely\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has chosen Scissors three consecutive times\n   - Their historical pattern shows they stick with moves for extended periods\n   - Even after losing, they often continue their current strategy\n   - I'll choose Paper again to beat their likely fourth consecutive Scissors\n   - This exploits their streak mentality and gives me the best odds of winning\n\n[move] Paper"
