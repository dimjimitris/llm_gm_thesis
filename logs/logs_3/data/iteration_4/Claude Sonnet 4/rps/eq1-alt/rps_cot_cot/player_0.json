    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be inexperienced or unpredictable\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns yet\n\n3. Evaluate initial strategy options:\n   - Random choice: Each move has equal probability of winning/losing/tying\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for new players (psychological tendency)\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to win\n   - If they choose something else, I have 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 of losing, 1/3 of tying\n\n4. Make strategic decision:\n   - Since many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's instinctive and feels \"strong\")\n   - Paper would beat rock, giving me the advantage\n   - This seems like the best statistical choice against a fresh player\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze what happened in Round 19:\n   - I chose paper, opponent chose paper\n   - This resulted in a tie (0 points each)\n   - Finally stopped their winning streak, but didn't gain any ground\n\n2. Update my current position:\n   - Total: -3 points (still significantly behind)\n   - At least I broke their 3-round winning streak\n   - But I desperately need actual wins, not just ties\n\n3. Analyze the opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 16: rock (won)\n   - Round 17: paper (won)\n   - Round 18: scissors (won)\n   - Round 19: paper (tie)\n   - They broke their own cycle by repeating paper instead of going to rock\n\n4. Consider what this means:\n   - They didn't continue the rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock cycle\n   - They chose paper twice in a row (rounds 17 and 19)\n   - This might indicate they're favoring paper again\n   - Or they predicted I would expect rock and chose paper to counter my likely paper choice\n\n5. Think about their next move:\n   - They just tied with paper\n   - If they stick with paper: scissors beats paper (I win!)\n   - If they switch to rock: paper beats rock (I win with paper)\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock beats scissors (I win with rock)\n   - All paths lead to me winning if I choose correctly\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - Given their recent paper usage (rounds 17 and 19) and previous tendency to favor paper\n   - They might stick with paper since it's been working for them\n   - Scissors beats paper, and I desperately need a win\n   - This is my best chance to start climbing back from -3\n\n[move] scissors"
