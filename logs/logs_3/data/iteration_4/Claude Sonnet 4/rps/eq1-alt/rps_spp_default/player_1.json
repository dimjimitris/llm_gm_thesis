You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

My opponent played rock in round 17, and I beat it with scissors.\n\nLooking at their recent pattern:\n- Round 14: Paper\n- Round 15: Paper  \n- Round 16: Scissors\n- Round 17: Rock\n\nThey seem to be cycling through the moves now: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. If this is a cycle, they might go back to paper next, or they could continue with a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, they might be reacting to my moves with a delay. Since I played paper in round 16, and they're reactive, they might play scissors (to beat paper).\n\nBut they just played rock and lost to my scissors, so they might switch away from rock. \n\nGiven the recent cycle pattern (paper, paper, scissors, rock), they might go to paper next to complete a cycle, or they might play scissors to react to my previous paper move.\n\nI'll predict they'll play paper and counter with rock.\n\n[move] rock"

They seem to favor paper (played it 3 out of the last 5 rounds), and when they switch, they go through scissors and rock before returning to paper.\n\nSince they just played paper in round 18 and lost to my rock, they might:\n1. Switch away from paper (maybe to scissors or rock)\n2. Stick with paper thinking I'll change\n3. Follow some reactive pattern\n\nGiven that paper just lost and they've shown a tendency to switch after losses, I think they'll move away from paper.

They've now played scissors twice (rounds 16 and 19) after playing paper.\n\nSince they just played scissors in round 19 and lost, they'll likely switch. Looking at the pattern, after scissors they've gone to rock before (round 17), or back to paper.\n\nGiven their tendency to cycle and the fact that scissors just failed, I predict they'll go to rock next.\n\nI'll play scissors to beat rock.\n\n[move] scissors"
