    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (I get +1, opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (I get +1, opponent gets -1)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (I get +1, opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be inexperienced or unpredictable\n   - I have no historical data about their playing patterns\n\n3. Develop a strategy for the first move:\n   - Since I have no information about opponent tendencies, each move has equal probability of winning\n   - In rock-paper-scissors against unknown opponents, there's often a slight bias toward rock (many beginners choose rock first)\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to win\n   - This is a reasonable first move strategy\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - Choose paper as it beats rock, which inexperienced players often default to\n   - This gives me the best chance to win against a \"fresh player\"\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze what happened in Round 1:\n   - Both my opponent and I chose paper\n   - This resulted in a tie (0 points each)\n   - My assumption that a \"fresh player\" would choose rock was incorrect\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also chose paper, which suggests they might have similar reasoning to mine\n   - They may have anticipated that I would expect them to choose rock as a beginner\n   - This indicates they might be thinking strategically, not just randomly\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They know I chose paper in Round 1\n   - They might think I'll stick with paper again\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to counter their paper\n   - If they expect me to switch to scissors (to beat their expected paper), they might choose rock\n   - If they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors\n\n4. Develop strategy for Round 2:\n   - Since they matched my paper choice, they're likely thinking ahead\n   - Many players will switch after a tie to avoid another tie\n   - If they switch from paper to scissors (expecting me to repeat paper), I should choose rock\n   - Rock beats scissors and would give me the win\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Choose rock to counter a potential switch to scissors\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze the pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: Both chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - My opponent is matching my moves or we're thinking very similarly\n\n2. What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They're either copying my strategy or using similar logic\n   - They might be anticipating my moves well\n   - The pattern suggests they're strategic, not random\n\n3. Consider the sequence pattern:\n   - We've both gone: paper \u2192 rock\n   - The natural next move in the sequence would be scissors\n   - But they might expect me to think this way\n\n4. Analyze opponent's potential thinking:\n   - If they're following the same logical progression, they'll choose scissors\n   - If they're trying to counter what they think I'll do, they might expect me to choose scissors and counter with rock\n   - If they're trying to break the pattern, they might go back to paper\n\n5. Develop strategy for Round 3:\n   - Given two ties, they might stick with the pattern and choose scissors\n   - If they choose scissors, I should choose rock to win\n   - But if they're anticipating this and choose rock to counter my expected scissors, then I should choose paper\n   - Since we've had paper and rock, and they seem to be thinking strategically, scissors seems most likely for them\n\n6.
