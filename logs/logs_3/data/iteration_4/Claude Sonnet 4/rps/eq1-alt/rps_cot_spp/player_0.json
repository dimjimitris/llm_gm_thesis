    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - The hint says I'm playing against a \"fresh player\"\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns yet\n   - They might make random choices or have common beginner tendencies\n\n3. Think about common patterns in rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Many beginners tend to start with rock (it feels strong/aggressive)\n   - Some players default to their dominant hand motion (often rock)\n   - Without prior information, I should assume roughly equal probability of each move\n\n4. Choose my strategy for this first move:\n   - Since I have no specific information about this opponent's tendencies\n   - And this is our first interaction\n   - I should make a move that gives me a good chance while not being too predictable\n   - Rock is often chosen by beginners, so paper could be a good counter\n   - But I shouldn't overthink the first move too much\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - I'll choose paper as it counters the commonly-chosen rock by new players\n   - This gives me a reasonable chance of winning the first round\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze this significant development:\n   - My opponent chose scissors twice in a row (rounds 8, 9)\n   - This breaks their previous pattern of switching after losses\n   - They might be stuck in a pattern or testing something\n   - Or they could be setting up a psychological trap\n   - This repetition is notable given their usually adaptive play\n\n4. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They've now lost twice with scissors against my paper\n   - If they're learning, they should switch from scissors\n   - They might choose rock (to beat my paper pattern)\n   - Or they might choose paper (thinking I'll switch to rock)\n   - Given they just lost twice in a row, they're very likely to change\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Since I've won twice with paper against their scissors, they'll probably expect me to stick with paper\n   - If they think I'll continue with paper, they'll likely choose scissors... wait no, that lost them the last two rounds\n   - They'll more likely choose rock to beat my expected paper\n   - But they might also think I'll switch to rock to counter their expected rock\n   - I think they'll choose rock to counter my paper streak, so I'll choose scissors\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Both my opponent and I chose paper again\n   - This resulted in another tie with 0 points\n   - My total score remains -1 points\n   - This is our 7th tie out of 18 rounds - nearly 40% tie rate\n\n2. Review my opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 14: scissors (beat my rock)\n   - Round 15: paper (tied with my paper)\n   - Round 16: scissors (beat my rock)\n   - Round 17: paper (tied with my paper)\n   - Round 18: paper (tied with my paper)\n   - The alternating pattern broke - they chose paper twice in a row\n\n3. Analyze the pattern change:\n   - They were alternating scissors-paper but chose paper in round 18 instead of scissors\n   - This could mean:\n     a) They abandoned the alternating strategy\n     b) They predicted I would figure out the pattern and counter it\n     c) They're switching to a paper-heavy strategy\n     d) They're thinking similarly to me (hence the tie)\n\n4. Consider their strategic thinking:\n   - They might have expected me to choose paper to counter their predicted scissors\n   - By choosing paper instead of scissors, they secured a tie rather than a loss\n   - This shows sophisticated strategic thinking - they're adapting their patterns\n   - The fact that we tied again suggests we're thinking along similar lines\n\n5. Plan my next move:\n   - They just chose paper twice in a row (rounds 17, 18)\n   - They might continue with paper, switch to scissors, or try rock\n   - Given their recent success with paper (lots of ties and wins), they might stick with it\n   - But they might also think I'll expect paper and choose rock to counter it\n   - If they choose rock: scissors beats rock (I win)\n   - If they choose paper: tie\n   - If they choose scissors: paper beats scissors (I win)\n   - Since they seem to like paper recently, and I want to break the tie pattern, I'll choose rock to beat paper\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze their strategy shift:\n   - They moved away from the scissors-paper alternating pattern\n   - They seem to have developed a strong preference for paper\n   - Even after two ties with paper, they chose it again in round 19\n   - This suggests either: a) they're committed to a paper strategy, or b) they're in a predictable pattern\n\n4. Consider their likely reaction:\n   - They just lost with paper to my rock\n   - Based on their previous behavior, they often switch after losses\n   - They might abandon paper after this loss\n   - They could choose scissors (to beat rock if I repeat it)\n   - Or they might choose rock (thinking I'll switch to paper)\n\n5. Plan my strategic response:\n   - If they switch to scissors (expecting me to repeat rock): paper beats scissors\n   - If they switch to rock (expecting me to counter with paper): scissors beats rock\n   - If they stick with paper (unlikely after the loss): rock beats paper\n   - Given their pattern of adapting after losses, and that rock just beat their paper, they'll likely choose scissors to counter a potential rock repeat\n   - I'll choose paper to counter their expected scissors\n\n[move] paper"
