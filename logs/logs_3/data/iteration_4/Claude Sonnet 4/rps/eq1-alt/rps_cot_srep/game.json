Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be inexperienced or unpredictable\n   - I have no prior information about their playing patterns\n\n3. Evaluate opening move strategies:\n   - Since this is the first round, I have no data on opponent's tendencies\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\"\n   - However, some beginners might overthink and choose scissors or paper\n   - A completely random choice would give me a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 of losing, 1/3 of tying\n\n4. Choose optimal first move:\n   - If the opponent is likely to choose rock (common beginner choice), paper would win\n   - Paper is a solid opening choice against inexperienced players\n   - It beats the most common beginner move (rock) and only loses to scissors\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper as my opening move, betting that a fresh player will likely choose rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Update my understanding of the opponent:\n   - They chose scissors in round 1\n   - This could indicate they were trying to counter an expected rock choice\n   - Or they might have chosen randomly\n   - One data point isn't enough to establish a clear pattern\n\n3. Consider opponent's potential next move:\n   - They might stick with scissors if they think it was just bad luck\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll play paper again\n   - They might try paper to counter a potential rock from me\n   - Fresh players sometimes alternate moves or follow simple patterns\n\n4.

Review my current situation:\n   - Previous total: -4 points\n   - Round 21: Me (paper) vs Opponent (scissors) - I won (+1)\n   - Current total: -3 points\n   - Dramatic turnaround from -6 points just 4 rounds ago\n\n3.

Observe opponent's likely next reaction:\n   - They just played scissors and lost to my paper\n   - Following their established reactive pattern, they'll likely switch from scissors\n   - They could switch to rock (to beat my paper) or back to paper\n   - Given my paper just beat their scissors, rock seems most likely as the direct counter\n\n5. Choose next move strategically:\n   - If they switch to rock (to counter my successful paper): scissors beats rock\n   - If they switch to paper: rock beats paper\n   - If they stick with scissors: paper beats scissors again\n   - Based on their consistent reactive behavior, rock is the most predictable choice to counter my paper\n   - Therefore: scissors would counter their likely rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, anticipating they'll switch to rock to counter my successful paper move.\n\n[move] scissors"

Choose next move strategically:\n   - If they switch to rock (to counter my successful paper): scissors beats rock\n   - If they switch to paper: rock beats paper\n   - If they stick with scissors: paper beats scissors again\n   - Based on their consistent reactive behavior, rock is the most predictable choice to counter my paper\n   - Therefore: scissors would counter their likely rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, anticipating they'll switch to rock to counter my successful paper move.\n\n[move] scissors",

Analyze what happened in Round 22:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played paper\n   - I lost this round, scoring -1 point (paper beats scissors)\n   - My prediction was wrong - they played paper instead of the expected rock\n\n2. Review my current situation:\n   - Previous total: -3 points\n   - Round 22: Me (scissors) vs Opponent (paper) - I lost (-1)\n   - Current total: -4 points\n   - First loss after 4 consecutive wins, but still much better than my -6 low point\n\n3. Analyze what went wrong with my prediction:\n   - I expected them to play rock to counter my successful paper\n   - Instead, they played paper (same as their previous losing move)\n   - This breaks their established reactive pattern\n   - They might be adapting to my successful prediction strategy\n\n4. Consider opponent's potential strategic shift:\n   - They may have noticed I was successfully predicting their reactions\n   - Playing paper again (instead of the \"logical\" rock counter) suggests:\n     a) They're trying to be less predictable\n     b) They're second-guessing their reactive approach\n     c) They're testing if I'll continue the prediction strategy\n\n5. Choose next move with this new information:\n   - They just played paper successfully against my scissors\n   - If they're becoming less predictable, I can't rely on the reactive pattern anymore\n   - But they might still have some tendency to repeat what works\n   - If they repeat paper: rock beats paper\n   - If they switch reactively to rock (to counter scissors): paper beats rock\n   - If they switch to scissors: paper beats scissors\n   - Rock covers the most likely scenario (repeated paper) and one switch option\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter their likely repeated paper, while acknowledging my prediction strategy may need further adjustment.\n\n[move] rock",

Review my current situation:\n   - Previous total: -4 points\n   - Round 23: Me (rock) vs Opponent (scissors) - I lost (-1)\n   - Current total: -5 points\n   - Back down to -5, losing the gains from my winning streak\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent moves and my failed predictions:\n   - Round 21: They played scissors, lost to my paper\n   - Round 22: They played paper (I expected rock), beat my scissors\n   - Round 23: They played scissors (I expected paper), beat my rock\n   - Their last 3 moves: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - They're no longer following the simple reactive pattern I identified\n\n4. Critical realization:\n   - My opponent has clearly adapted to counter my prediction strategy\n   - They're now being deliberately unpredictable or following a different logic\n   - The reactive pattern strategy worked for 4 rounds, but they've adjusted\n   - I need to abandon the assumption that they'll react predictably to my moves\n\n5. Choose next move with new approach:\n   - They just played scissors successfully\n   - Rather than trying to predict their reaction, I should focus on direct counters\n   - If they repeat scissors: paper beats scissors\n   - If they switch to anything else, I have a 1/3 chance regardless\n   - Given scissors just worked for them and they might stick with success, paper is a reasonable choice\n   - This returns to my earlier successful direct counter approach\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to directly counter their recent successful scissors, abandoning complex prediction attempts.\n\n[move] paper",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
