Scissors beats rock! I had this wrong. So when I played rock and they played scissors, they won because scissors beats rock.\n\nThe correct rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nMy opponent's sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\nThey did exactly what I predicted - after playing rock twice, they switched to scissors (their least-used move). I correctly anticipated their move but chose the wrong counter!\n\nTo beat scissors, I need to play paper.\n\nSince they just played scissors and tend to switch after using a move, they might go to rock or paper next. I'll play paper, which beats scissors if they repeat it, and loses to rock but beats scissors.\n\n[move] paper",

Looking at what typically follows consecutive papers in their history - I don't have much data on this.\n\nI'll try scissors, which beats paper if they continue with paper, and also gives me a different option.\n\n[move] scissors",
