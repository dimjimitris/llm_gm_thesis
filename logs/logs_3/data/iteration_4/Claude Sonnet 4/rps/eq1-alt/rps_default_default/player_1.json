    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They seem to be stuck in a paper pattern recently, even after losing twice in a row to my rock.\n\nRecent moves:\n- Round 20: paper\n- Round 21: paper (lost to my rock)\n- Round 22: paper (lost to my rock again)\n\nThis is interesting - they're continuing with paper despite losing with it twice. This could mean:\n- They're very committed to their paper strategy\n- They expect me to switch away from rock\n- They haven't adjusted their strategy yet\n\nSince rock has worked twice in a row against their paper, and they seem to be sticking with paper, I think there's a good chance they might finally switch now after two consecutive losses. But there's also a chance they'll stick with paper again.\n\nI'll play rock once more since it's been working so well against their apparent paper fixation.\n\n[move] rock"

This is remarkable persistence despite losing three consecutive rounds.\n\nRecent moves:\n- Round 21: paper (lost to my rock)\n- Round 22: paper (lost to my rock)\n- Round 23: paper (lost to my rock)\n\nAt this point, they must either:\n- Finally switch away from paper after three losses\n- Be extremely committed to this strategy\n- Not be adapting to my moves\n\nAfter losing three times in a row with paper, logic suggests they should switch. But they've shown incredible stubbornness with paper. \n\nI think there's a high probability they'll finally switch now - probably to scissors (to beat my rock) or rock (to tie). If they play scissors, my rock will beat it. If they play rock, we tie.\n\nI'll stick with rock one more time, as it's been incredibly successful and can still beat scissors if they switch to counter me.\n\n[move] rock"
