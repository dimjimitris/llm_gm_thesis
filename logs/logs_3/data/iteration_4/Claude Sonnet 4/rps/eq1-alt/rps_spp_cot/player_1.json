Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game where I need to choose one move against another player.\n\n2. The payoff structure is:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent) \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Same moves result in a tie (0 points for both)\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I need to consider what they might choose:\n   - New players often default to rock as it's considered \"strong\"\n   - Some might choose scissors thinking it's \"sharp/cutting\"\n   - Paper is sometimes seen as the \"weakest\" option by beginners\n\n4. If I assume the opponent is likely to choose rock (common beginner choice), then I should choose paper to beat rock.\n\n5. However, I should also consider that this could be a psychological game where they expect me to think they'll choose rock, so they might choose something else.\n\n6. For the first round against a fresh player, I'll go with the statistical tendency that beginners often choose rock, so I'll counter with paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

Opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Rock, Rock, Rock, Paper, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Paper\n   - Recent trend shows: Rock, Rock, Paper, Paper\n\n3. Looking at the last few rounds more carefully:\n   - Rounds 7-10: Rock, Rock, Paper, Paper\n   - They seem to be playing moves in pairs now rather than triplets\n\n4. If this \"pairs\" pattern continues, they might switch from paper to something else, or play paper one more time.\n\n5. However, I notice that when I've played rock recently (rounds 5, 6, 7, 10), their responses were: Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper. So they frequently respond to my rock with paper.\n\n6. Since I just played rock and won, they might:\n   - Stick with paper (as they often do against rock)\n   - Switch to scissors (to beat my potential rock)\n   - Switch to rock (trying something different)\n\n7. Given that paper has been their most common response to my rock plays, and they just played paper twice in recent rounds, I'll stick with rock to capitalize on their apparent paper preference.\n\n[move] Rock"

Opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Rock, Rock, Rock, Paper, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Scissors\n   - Recent sequence: Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Scissors\n\n3. Very interesting pattern emerging in recent rounds:\n   - Rounds 14-18: Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Scissors\n   - They're alternating between scissors and rock!\n\n4. This alternating pattern (scissors-rock-scissors-rock-scissors) suggests they might continue with rock next, following the established alternation.\n\n5. Key insights:\n   - The tie suggests they either predicted my move or we're both following similar logic\n   - The alternating pattern is quite clear in the last 5 rounds\n   - They seem to have shifted from complex counter-adaptation to a simpler alternating strategy\n\n6. If they continue the scissors-rock alternation pattern, they should play rock next.\n\n7. To beat rock, I should play paper.\n\n8. However, I need to consider they might break this pattern since it's become quite obvious, or they might expect me to recognize it and counter accordingly.\n\n9. Given the clear alternating pattern and that paper beats rock, I'll stick with the pattern analysis and play paper.\n\n[move] Paper"
