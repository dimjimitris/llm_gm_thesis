    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to think through this rock-paper-scissors game strategically.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game where I need to maximize my points.\n2. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this could mean they're new or unpredictable.\n3. The payoff structure is standard: each win gives +1 point, each loss gives -1 point, ties give 0 points.\n4. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to make a random choice to avoid being predictable.\n5. In game theory, the optimal strategy for rock-paper-scissors with no prior information is to play each option with equal probability (1/3 each).\n6. I'll choose rock as my opening move - it's a solid, straightforward choice that doesn't reveal any particular strategy.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to start with a neutral, unpredictable opening move.\n\n[move] rock"

Wait - the hint says I won, but rock loses to paper. Let me reread... it says \"You won the round\" but then \"rock vs paper\" - there might be an error in the message, but I'll trust that I won and scored 1 point.\n\n2. My opponent played paper in the first round. This gives me one data point about their behavior.\n\n3. Since I'm facing a \"fresh player,\" they might not have a sophisticated strategy yet. New players often:\n   - Stick with what worked (if they think paper worked)\n   - Try to counter what I played (expecting me to play rock again)\n   - Play randomly\n\n4. If they think their paper was successful, they might play paper again.\n   \n5. If they expect me to play rock again, they might play paper again to counter it.\n\n6. To counter a potential paper play from them, I should play scissors.\n\n7. However, I also need to avoid being too predictable myself. Playing scissors could be a good strategic choice here.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to potentially counter their likely paper choice while staying unpredictable.\n\n[move] scissors"
