Let me assume the scoring information is correct (I won with 1 point) and proceed.\n\nSince this is only the second round with a fresh player, I still don't have enough information to detect a clear pattern. My opponent chose paper in round 1. I should avoid being predictable while trying to counter potential patterns.\n\n[move] scissors"
