They went back to rock when I switched to rock. This confirms they're adapting to my moves somewhat.\n\n6. Looking at the pattern more carefully:\n   - When I play scissors, they often play paper (3 out of 5 times)\n   - When I play rock, they play rock (2 out of 2 times so far)\n   - When I play paper, they played rock both times\n\n7. It seems like they might be trying to counter-adapt to my moves, but rock is still their most frequent choice overall.\n\n8. Since I'm at -4 points, I need to try something different. Maybe I should play paper since they seem to favor rock overall, and when I don't play scissors, they tend toward rock.\n\n9. If they expect me to play rock again (since we just tied with rock), they might stick with rock, so paper would beat that.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper to beat rock, expecting they might continue with their overall preference for rock.\n\n[move] (Expecting they might return to their overall rock preference after our tie) paper"

They are definitely copying my moves now! This is a reactive mirroring strategy.\n\n7. Since they're mirroring, I can exploit this by playing the move that beats what I'm about to play.\n\n8.

I finally won another round. They went back to rock after the mirroring phase, confirming rock is still their preferred move.\n\n6.

I've now won 2 rounds in a row by playing scissors against their rock. My score improved from -3 to -2.\n\n8. The pattern strongly suggests they have a fundamental preference for rock, especially when not in a reactive/mirroring phase.\n\n9.

They seem to be alternating between scissors and rock recently, breaking from the previous clear adaptive pattern.\n\n9. If they continue this scissors-rock alternation, the next move should be rock.\n\n10. To beat rock, I need scissors.\n\n11. However, I should also consider that they might be getting more unpredictable as they realize I've been reading their patterns successfully.\n\n12. Rock is still their most frequent move overall (9 times), so betting on rock with scissors is still statistically sound.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors to beat rock, expecting either a continuation of the recent scissors-rock alternation or their overall rock preference.\n\n[move] (Expecting rock based on either their alternation pattern or overall rock preference) scissors",
