    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They played paper for the third consecutive round! This is now their longest streak of the same move.\n\n6. Looking at their pattern: paper, paper, paper - they're really committing to paper now.\n\n7. Paper is now almost as frequent as rock in their overall strategy (7 vs 8).\n\n8. Since they've played paper 3 times in a row and seem to be sticking with it, I should play scissors to beat paper.\n\n9. The key insight is that they tend to play moves in streaks when they find something that works or when they're adapting to my strategy.\n\n10. Rock beats paper, so I should play rock to beat their likely continued paper strategy.\n\nWait, let me double-check: \"paper beats scissors\" and \"rock beats paper\" - so rock beats paper, not scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock to beat paper, since they've played paper 3 times in a row and seem committed to this strategy.\n\n[move] (They've played paper 3 times in a row, so playing rock to beat their continued paper strategy) rock"

They're now tied between rock and paper as their most frequent moves (8 each).\n\n8. The paper streak is now at 4 rounds: paper, paper, paper, paper. This is their longest streak in the entire game.\n\n9. At some point they're likely to break this pattern. They might:\n   - Continue with paper (less likely after 4 in a row)\n   - Switch to scissors (to beat my successful rock strategy)\n   - Go back to rock (their other preferred move)\n\n10.
