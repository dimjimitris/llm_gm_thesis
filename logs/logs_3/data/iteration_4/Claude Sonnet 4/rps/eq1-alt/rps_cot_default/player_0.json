    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they are new and may not have developed any particular strategy yet.\n3. Against a fresh/new player, they might:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Have a slight bias toward rock (many beginners default to rock)\n   - Be predictable in some way\n4. Since I have no prior information about their playing pattern, I should make a strategic first move.\n5. Rock is often the most intuitive choice for new players, so playing paper could be advantageous.\n6. However, if they're truly random, any choice has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n7. I'll go with paper as my opening move, betting on the common tendency for new players to choose rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially beat rock, which new players often choose.\n\n[move] paper"

Let me re-read: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n3. So rock beats paper, not the other way around! I had the classic rock-paper-scissors rules backwards.\n4. The correct rules are:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock\n5. My opponent played rock in the first round, beating my paper.\n6. Now I need to predict their next move. They won with rock, so they might:\n   - Stick with rock since it worked\n   - Switch to something else thinking I'll counter with scissors\n   - Play randomly\n7. If they stick with rock, I should play scissors to beat it.\n8. If they think I'll play scissors to counter rock, they might play paper to beat my scissors.\n9. Given they're a \"fresh player\" and just won with rock, there's a good chance they'll stick with what worked.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat rock, anticipating they might repeat their winning move.\n\n[move] scissors"
