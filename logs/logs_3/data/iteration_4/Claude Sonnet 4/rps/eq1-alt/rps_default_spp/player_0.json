Since I apparently won the last round with rock against their paper, I need to consider what they might do next. A fresh player who just lost with paper might:\n- Switch to scissors (thinking rock will come again)\n- Switch to rock (copying the winning move)\n- Stick with paper (not changing strategy yet)\n\nI'll go with scissors this time to counter a potential rock from my opponent.\n\n[move] scissors"

Since we just tied with scissors, they might expect me to switch.\n\nGiven that they've played paper and scissors so far, if they're following a pattern they might play rock next.
