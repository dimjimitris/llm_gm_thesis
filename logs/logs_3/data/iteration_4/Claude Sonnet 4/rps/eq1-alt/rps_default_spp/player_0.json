    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at their recent moves, they seem to be cycling through all three options without a clear pattern. In their last 5 moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\nPaper has appeared 3 times in those 5 moves, which is quite frequent. They might be favoring paper recently, or it could be coincidental.\n\nGiven that they just played paper and have used it frequently in recent rounds, I have a few options:\n1. Play scissors to beat paper if they continue with it\n2. Play rock to beat scissors if they switch\n3. Play paper to tie if they stick with paper\n\nSince paper has been their most frequent recent choice, I'll play scissors to capitalize on this potential tendency.\n\n[move] scissors"
