In round 1, they played paper (which beats rock), and in round 2, they matched my scissors.\n\nI need to avoid being predictable while trying to anticipate their strategy. Since I've played rock and scissors, I haven't used paper yet. I'll complete the cycle and choose paper this time.\n\n[move] paper"
