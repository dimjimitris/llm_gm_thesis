    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "Let me think through this step-by-step to maximize my chances of winning.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game where I need to beat my opponent to get +1 points while they get -1 points.\n\n2. I'm told I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new or inexperienced.\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, I need to make a strategic choice.\n\n4. Fresh/inexperienced players often have predictable patterns:\n   - Many beginners start with rock (it feels like the strongest/most aggressive choice)\n   - Some might choose scissors thinking it's clever\n   - Paper is often seen as the \"weakest\" choice by beginners\n\n5. If I assume the opponent is likely to choose rock (common beginner choice), then I should choose paper to beat rock.\n\n6. This gives me the best expected value based on typical beginner behavior patterns.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Let me analyze what just happened and plan for the next round.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. I chose paper and my opponent chose rock. According to the rules, rock beats paper, so I lost and got -1 points.\n\n2. Wait - I need to double-check the rules. The hint says \"You lost\" and \"rock beats paper\", but earlier the rules stated \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" This confirms rock does beat paper.\n\n3. My assumption about the fresh player choosing rock was correct, but I made an error in my strategy - I should have chosen scissors to beat rock, not paper.\n\n4. Now for round 2: The opponent chose rock in round 1. Fresh players often:\n   - Stick with what they think \"worked\" (rock won, so they might repeat it)\n   - Switch to try something different\n   - Follow simple patterns\n\n5. Since rock \"worked\" for them last round, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with rock again.\n\n6. If they choose rock again, I should choose scissors to beat rock.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might think I'll expect rock again and switch to scissors or paper. But as a fresh player, they're more likely to stick with the winning choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat rock, assuming they'll repeat their successful move.\n\n[move] scissors"

Round 2: Opponent chose scissors, I chose scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n3. Current total: -1 points\n\n4. Looking at the opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: rock\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - This suggests they're not sticking with winning moves, but rather switching\n\n5. The sequence so far is rock \u2192 scissors. In rock-paper-scissors, this could indicate:\n   - Random play\n   - Following a pattern (rock, scissors, paper cycle?)\n   - Reacting to what they think I might do\n\n6. If they're following a rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper pattern, then paper would be next.\n7. To beat paper, I should choose scissors.\n\n8. Alternatively, if they're playing more randomly or trying to counter what they think I'll do, I need to consider:\n   - They might expect me to choose rock (to beat their potential scissors repeat)\n   - They might choose paper thinking I'll choose rock\n   - They might go back to rock since it worked in round 1\n\n9. Given the limited data and that they switched from rock to scissors, I'll assume they might continue the potential cycle to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat paper, predicting they'll complete a rock-scissors-paper sequence.\n\n[move] scissors"
