Confirm the opponent's locked pattern:\n   - They are absolutely stuck in this reactive cycle\n   - Every single time they try to counter what they think I'll repeat\n   - The pattern is 100% consistent across 5 rounds\n   - They seem unable to break out of this predictable behavior\n\n3. Analyze their likely mental state:\n   - They're probably frustrated and confused by losing 5 straight\n   - They might be overthinking or panicking\n   - This could make them even more likely to stick with familiar patterns\n   - Or they might finally realize they need to break the cycle\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - I just won with scissors, so they'll expect me to repeat scissors\n   - Following their unwavering pattern, they should play paper to counter my \"expected\" scissors\n   - If they play paper, I need rock to beat it and extend to 6 wins\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - This pattern has been flawless for 5 consecutive rounds\n   - They show no signs of adapting or breaking free\n   - Rock should beat their expected paper and give me a sixth straight win\n   - I'll continue riding this pattern until they finally adapt\n   - At +4 points, I have a commanding lead to protect\n\n[move] Rock - opponent will expect me to repeat scissors and will play paper to counter it, so rock will beat their paper and extend my winning streak to 6",
