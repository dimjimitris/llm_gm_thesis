Review the incredible winning streak:\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper - I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock - I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper - I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock - I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper - I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I won (+1 points)\n   - Current score: +8 points total (extraordinary!)\n\n2. Analyze the perfect cycling pattern:\n   - Opponent's last 8 moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - The cycle is: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 repeat (position 1 \u2192 position 2 \u2192 position 3 \u2192 repeat)\n   - They are completely trapped in this predictable rotation\n   - 8 consecutive losses haven't broken their pattern\n\n3. Cycle position tracking:\n   - Round 22: scissors (position 1 in cycle)\n   - Next should be: rock (position 2 in cycle)\n   - The pattern has been mathematically perfect for 8 rounds\n   - They seem unable or unwilling to break this losing cycle\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - Following the established cycle: scissors was just played (position 1)\n   - Next must be rock (position 2 in the cycle)\n   - The reliability is now at 100% over 8 consecutive rounds\n   - Rock is as certain as any prediction can be\n\n5. Make my strategic choice:\n   - If they play rock (following the cycle): I should play scissors\n   - The pattern has never failed, making this an extremely confident prediction\n   - I'll play scissors to beat rock and aim for my 9th consecutive win\n\n[move] (Following the opponent's mathematically perfect cycling pattern where rock comes next after scissors in their established rotation) scissors",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
