Let me check: paper beats scissors, so scissors should beat... no, actually looking at the rules again:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper  \n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo if I played paper and they played scissors, scissors should beat paper, meaning I should have lost. But the hint says I won and scored 1 point. Let me trust the game feedback - my total score is now 0.\n\nThe opponent's sequence:\n- Round 1: paper\n- Round 2: paper  \n- Round 3: scissors\n- Round 4: paper\n- Round 5: paper\n- Round 6: scissors\n- Round 7: paper\n- Round 8: scissors\n- Round 9: rock\n- Round 10: paper\n- Round 11: paper\n- Round 12: scissors\n- Round 13: paper\n- Round 14: rock\n- Round 15: scissors\n\nCurrent distribution:\n- Paper: 8 times\n- Scissors: 5 times  \n- Rock: 2 times\n\nThey went back to scissors. Recent sequence: paper, rock, scissors. They're cycling through different moves more now. Given their overall pattern, paper is still most common, but scissors usage is increasing.\n\n[move] (Expecting possible return to paper preference) rock"
