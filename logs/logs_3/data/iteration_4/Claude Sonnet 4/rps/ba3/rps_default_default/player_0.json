    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that paper has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with a common first choice.\n\nMany people tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games since it feels like a strong, default choice. If my opponent chooses rock, I want to play paper to get the maximum 3 points.\n\nEven if they don't choose rock, the worst case scenario is losing 1 point (if they play scissors), while the best case is gaining 3 points (if they play rock).\n\n[move] Paper"

The strategy is working exceptionally well.\n\nAfter losing with scissors, they might:\n1. Try rock (their defensive fallback)\n2. Try paper (going for high value)\n3. Continue some pattern\n\nLooking at their recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors. After major losses, they've shown a tendency to either go defensive (rock) or try for high value (paper).\n\nGiven that they've lost with scissors multiple times when I've correctly predicted it, they might be getting frustrated with scissors. They could either:\n- Go to rock as their most \"reliable\" choice (even though it's been beaten badly too)\n- Try paper for the maximum payoff potential\n\nIf they play rock, I should play paper (+3 points).\nIf they play paper, I should play scissors (+1 point).\n\nTheir pattern shows they often go to rock when under pressure, and they just took another loss. I think rock is likely.\n\n[move] Paper"

But they could also be trying to be less predictable.\n\nAfter just tying with paper, they might:\n1. Try scissors to counter paper (based on their previous pattern)\n2. Stick with paper (since it's high value and we just tied)\n3. Try rock (mixing things up)\n\nGiven their historical pattern of playing scissors after paper ties (especially rounds 5 and 11), I think scissors is most likely.\n\n[move] Rock"
