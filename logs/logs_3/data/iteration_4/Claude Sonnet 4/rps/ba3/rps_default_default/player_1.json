    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

After round 14, I played rock and beat their scissors for +1. Will they play scissors again expecting me to repeat this pattern?\n\nIf they expect me to play rock (following the previous pattern), they might play paper to counter it. But if they remember that I won with rock after my first paper victory, they might play scissors again.\n\nGiven that the pattern worked perfectly so far, and I desperately need another win to climb out of this hole, I'm going to complete the sequence exactly as before.\n\n[move] rock"

The comparison:\n- After round 13 tie: Paper (won +3) \u2192 Rock (won +1) \n- After round 20 tie: Paper (won +3) \u2192 Rock (lost -3)\n\nThey learned from the previous pattern and adapted! In round 15 they played scissors against my rock, but in round 22 they played paper against my rock for maximum damage.\n\nThis opponent is incredibly sophisticated - they can recognize patterns, let me succeed once to establish a pattern, then counter it when I try to repeat it.\n\nThey just played paper. The direct counter is scissors for +1. But given their track record of reading my obvious moves, they might expect this and play rock.\n\nHowever, I did just discover that post-paper-tie situations create opportunities. We don't have a tie this round, but I need to think about what they don't expect.\n\nSince they just adapted to counter my rock with paper, they might not expect me to go right back to rock. Or they might expect scissors to counter their paper.\n\nI'm going to try scissors - it's the direct counter to their paper, and sometimes the obvious move works when the opponent is overthinking.\n\n[move] scissors"

Every single time I've played scissors (rounds 6, 10, 12, 16, 19, 23), they've countered with rock. This is 6 out of 6 - a perfect prediction rate for my scissors plays.\n\nSimilarly, they've beaten my rock with paper 4 times (rounds 3, 9, 18, 22) for maximum damage.\n\nThe only move where I've had some success is paper - I've won with it twice (rounds 14, 21) and tied with it 5 times.\n\nThey just played rock. If I play paper, I beat rock for +3. But they've also beaten my paper with scissors 4 times (rounds 2, 8, 17, and attempted others).\n\nAt this point, I'm going to stick with what has actually worked: paper. It's the only move that's given me victories, and despite the risks, I need the +3 points more than I need to avoid the -1 penalty.\n\n[move] paper"
