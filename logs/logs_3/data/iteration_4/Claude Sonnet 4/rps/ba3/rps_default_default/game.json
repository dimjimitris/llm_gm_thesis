Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with a common first choice.\n\nMany people tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games since it feels like a strong, default choice. If my opponent chooses rock, I want to play paper to get the maximum 3 points.\n\nEven if they don't choose rock, the worst case scenario is losing 1 point (if they play scissors), while the best case is gaining 3 points (if they play rock).\n\n[move] Paper"

They played scissors exactly as I predicted - they expected me to repeat paper after my big win, so they countered with scissors, but I anticipated this and played rock.\n\nTheir sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\nNow I have momentum. The question is: what do they expect after I've won two rounds in a row? They might be rattled or they might think I've found a pattern.\n\nI just played rock and beat their scissors. They might expect me to stick with rock, or they might think I'll go back to paper since that gave me the big +3 win.\n\nIf they expect rock from me, they'd play paper.\nIf they expect paper from me, they'd play scissors.\nIf they think I'll play scissors (to beat their potential paper), they'd play rock.\n\nGiven that they just lost with scissors, and I've been successful with my last two reads, I think they might try paper to counter a potential rock repeat from me. So I'll play scissors to beat their paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

They seem very good at predicting when I'll play scissors.\n\nThe pattern shows they're comfortable playing rock when they expect scissors from me. They just played rock again, so the question is: do they expect me to continue with a pattern, or will they switch?\n\nGiven that my two wins came from paper (round 14) and rock (round 15), and my recent loss was scissors, maybe I should go back to one of my winning moves.

They've beaten my paper with scissors in rounds 2, 8, and 17. In round 14 when I won with paper, they played rock instead.\n\nThey just played scissors. Historically, when they play scissors, I should play rock to beat it if they repeat. But they rarely repeat the same move consecutively except in specific situations.\n\nLooking at their recent pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. They're alternating! If this continues, they should play rock next.\n\nIf they play rock, I need paper to beat it for +3. But that's exactly what they expect me to think. This is the meta-game within the game.\n\nI'm going to go with rock. It's safer than paper (only -1 vs -3 penalty) and beats scissors if they don't follow the alternating pattern.\n\n[move] rock"

There's something about paper that leads to synchronized thinking between us. \n\nLooking at this latest tie, maybe they're also struggling to predict what I'll do next, or we're both thinking that paper is the \"default\" high-value move.\n\nSince we just tied on paper again, they might expect me to switch away from it. But here's a crazy thought - what if I stick with paper one more time? \n\nThe paper ties seem to happen when we're both thinking similarly about going for the high-value move. If they think I'll switch away from paper after another tie, they might play rock or scissors, and my paper would beat rock for +3.\n\nIt's extremely risky since they've beaten my paper with scissors multiple times, but I'm already down -11 and desperate for a win.\n\n[move] paper",

If I play paper, I beat rock for +3. But they've also beaten my paper with scissors 4 times (rounds 2, 8, 17, and attempted others).\n\nAt this point, I'm going to stick with what has actually worked: paper. It's the only move that's given me victories, and despite the risks, I need the +3 points more than I need to avoid the -1 penalty.\n\n[move] paper",
