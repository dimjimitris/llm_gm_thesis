Rock and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history, I should consider what move gives me the best expected value. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nIf the opponent plays rock, then paper wins me +3 points. If they play scissors, paper loses me -1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie (0 points).\n\nGiven the high reward potential and the tendency for new players to choose rock, paper seems like a strong opening move.\n\n[move] paper"
