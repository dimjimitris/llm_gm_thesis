    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This creates an asymmetric payoff structure.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history, I should consider what a new player might choose. Many people default to rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven the high payoff for paper beating rock, and the reasonable probability that a fresh player might choose rock, paper seems like the optimal first move.\n\n[move] paper"

Paper and rock are now tied at 7 uses each, with scissors at 6.\n\nRecent pattern: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\nThey broke out of their rock-heavy phase and went to paper. This could mean:\n1. They're trying to be less predictable after using rock so heavily\n2. They might have expected me to counter with paper (which I did) and wanted to tie rather than lose\n3. They could be returning to a more balanced approach\n\nFor round 21, after switching from rock back to paper, they might:\n- Continue with paper\n- Return to rock (their recent favorite)\n- Try scissors (their least used recently)\n\nSince we just tied with paper, they might think I'll stick with paper or they might expect me to switch. \n\nLooking at gaps: scissors hasn't been used since round 18 (2 rounds ago), making it somewhat overdue compared to paper and rock which were just used.\n\nIf they choose scissors, my rock wins (+1).\nIf they choose rock, my paper wins (+3).\nIf they choose paper again, we tie (0).\n\nGiven that they just broke their rock pattern with paper, and scissors is slightly overdue, I think there's a reasonable chance they'll either go to scissors or back to rock. \n\nI'll choose rock to beat potential scissors, and if they return to rock, I lose only -1 (better than the -3 I'd lose if I chose scissors and they chose paper).\n\n[move] rock"
