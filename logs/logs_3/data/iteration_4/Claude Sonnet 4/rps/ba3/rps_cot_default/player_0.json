Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, making it the most valuable winning move.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they may:\n   - Choose rock as it's often seen as the \"default\" or \"aggressive\" choice\n   - Lack knowledge of the asymmetric payoff structure\n   - Play somewhat randomly without strategic consideration\n\n4. Formulate strategy: Since paper beats rock and gives the maximum points (+3), and rock is a common choice for new players, paper offers the best risk-reward ratio for this first move.\n\n5. Make the decision: Play paper to potentially capitalize on a rock choice while securing the highest possible point gain.\n\n[move] paper"

This suggests the opponent may also recognize paper's high value (+3 points when winning).\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely thinking: Since they also played paper, they might:\n   - Have similar strategic reasoning about paper's high payoff\n   - Stick with paper again, thinking it's the \"best\" move\n   - Or switch away from paper, thinking I'll expect them to repeat it\n\n3. Evaluate my options against a potential repeat of paper:\n   - If opponent plays paper again: I need scissors to beat paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n4. Consider the risk-reward: \n   - Playing scissors beats paper (+1) but loses to rock (-1)\n   - Playing rock beats scissors (+1) but loses badly to paper (-3)\n   - Playing paper ties with paper (0) but beats rock (+3)\n\n5. Strategic decision: Since the opponent showed they understand paper's value, they might repeat it or expect me to switch.

Decision reasoning:\n   - Scissors beats paper and gives me a win if they stick with their new paper strategy\n   - If they've switched to scissors to counter my paper, I lose only -1\n   - If they return to rock, I miss the +3 opportunity, but rock vs scissors is only -1\n   - Scissors seems like the best counter to their likely paper continuation\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - They briefly adapted to paper to avoid my paper exploitation\n   - But immediately returned to rock in the very next round\n   - This suggests rock is their deeply preferred/default move\n   - They seem to revert to rock quickly after brief experiments\n\n3. Strategic insight:\n   - The opponent appears to have a strong rock bias that's hard to shake\n   - Their adaptation was temporary - they couldn't resist returning to rock\n   - This one-round paper experiment might have been their attempt to \"reset\" before going back to rock\n\n4. Prediction for round 12:\n   - Given their pattern: rock \u2192 (brief paper experiment) \u2192 rock\n   - They're likely to continue with rock since they just won with it\n   - Their rock preference seems almost compulsive at this point\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - If they play rock again (highly likely): paper wins +3\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock wins +1, paper loses -1\n   - If they switch to paper: scissors wins +1, paper ties 0\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - I'm still ahead by +3 points, so I can afford some risk\n   - Their rock pattern is too strong and profitable to ignore\n   - Even if they surprise me, I maintain a good lead\n   - The +3 reward for beating rock is worth the risk\n\n[move] paper"

Review the recent sequence:\n   - Round 19: scissors vs rock = I won (+1)\n   - Round 20: paper vs paper = tie (0)\n   - Round 21: rock vs scissors = I lost (-1)\n   - Current total score: +1 - 1 = 0 points (completely tied)\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's rock returns:\n   - They keep returning to rock at key moments (rounds 18 and 21)\n   - Rock appears to be their \"comfort move\" when they want a reliable choice\n   - They've played rock in rounds 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 18, and 21 (8 out of 21 rounds)\n\n3. Critical position assessment:\n   - I've lost my entire lead and we're now tied\n   - The opponent has successfully countered most of my recent strategies\n   - They've evolved from predictable to much more strategic\n   - Every move now matters significantly\n\n4. Consider their likely next move:\n   - Rock continues to be their most frequent choice\n   - They might stick with rock after it just won\n   - Or they might switch, expecting me to counter with paper\n   - Their recent pattern shows more variability but rock bias remains\n\n5. Strategic considerations for round 22:\n   - If they play rock again: paper beats rock (+3 - maximum gain)\n   - If they play scissors: rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they play paper: scissors beats paper (+1)\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - I'm at 0 points and need to regain advantage\n   - Rock is still their most common move historically\n   - Paper gives me the maximum possible reward (+3) if they play rock\n   - Even if they switch to scissors, I only lose -1\n   - With the game potentially nearing its end, I need to take calculated risks for big gains\n   - Their rock tendency makes paper the highest expected value play\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Another tie with paper! The opponent is matching my strategic thinking more and more. I need to break this pattern.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the recent sequence:\n   - Round 20: paper vs paper = tie (0)\n   - Round 21: rock vs scissors = I lost (-1)\n   - Round 22: paper vs paper = tie (0)\n   - Current total score: 0 points (still tied)\n\n2. Analyze the concerning trend:\n   - Two ties with paper in 3 rounds (rounds 20 and 22)\n   - The opponent seems to be anticipating my moves better\n   - They're either thinking similarly or reading my strategy\n\n3. Consider the opponent's evolution:\n   - Started with predictable patterns (rock obsession, then scissors obsession)\n   - Now showing much more sophisticated play\n   - Successfully matching my moves when I go for high-value plays\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic situation:\n   - Still at 0 points after multiple rounds\n   - Need to break the tie pattern to gain advantage\n   - The opponent has become much harder to exploit\n\n5. Strategic analysis for round 23:\n   - They've played paper twice recently, might continue or switch\n   - If they expect me to play paper again: they might play scissors to beat it\n   - If they play scissors: rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they play paper again: scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - If they play rock: paper beats rock (+3)\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - I need to think differently since they're anticipating my moves\n   - They might expect me to continue with paper after two ties\n   - If they counter with scissors, I should play rock\n   - Rock also beats scissors if they're trying to counter-exploit\n   - Even against paper, rock only loses -3, but against scissors it wins +1\n   - Given the recent paper focus, scissors from them becomes more likely\n\n[move] rock"

Review the recent tie pattern:\n   - Round 20: paper vs paper = tie (0)\n   - Round 21: rock vs scissors = I lost (-1)\n   - Round 22: paper vs paper = tie (0)\n   - Round 23: rock vs rock = tie (0)\n   - Current total score: 0 points (still completely tied)\n\n2. Analyze the alarming trend:\n   - 3 ties out of the last 4 rounds\n   - We're matching each other's strategic thinking\n   - The opponent has evolved to think like me or predict my moves\n   - Only non-tie was a loss for me\n\n3. Consider what this means:\n   - My traditional pattern-recognition approach isn't working anymore\n   - The opponent has become as strategic as I am\n   - We're both second-guessing each other into similar choices\n   - Need a completely different approach\n\n4. Evaluate my critical position:\n   - At 0 points with multiple ties\n   - Not making progress toward winning\n   - The opponent has successfully neutralized my advantages\n   - Every move is crucial now\n\n5. Strategic shift needed:\n   - Stop trying to predict their patterns\n   - They're clearly adapting to my predictions\n   - Need to make a move that breaks the mutual prediction cycle\n   - Focus on moves that have good outcomes regardless of prediction\n\n6. Decision for round 24:\n   - Since we keep matching moves, I need to think about what they DON'T expect\n   - We've tied with paper twice and rock once recently\n   - Scissors hasn't appeared in ties recently\n   - If they expect another paper/rock battle, scissors might be unexpected\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) and only loses to rock (-1)\n   - Given the recent focus on paper/rock, scissors could break the pattern\n\n[move] scissors"
