Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, making it the most valuable winning move.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they may:\n   - Choose rock as it's often seen as the \"default\" or \"aggressive\" choice\n   - Lack knowledge of the asymmetric payoff structure\n   - Play somewhat randomly without strategic consideration\n\n4. Formulate strategy: Since paper beats rock and gives the maximum points (+3), and rock is a common choice for new players, paper offers the best risk-reward ratio for this first move.\n\n5. Make the decision: Play paper to potentially capitalize on a rock choice while securing the highest possible point gain.\n\n[move] paper"

This suggests the opponent may also recognize paper's high value (+3 points when winning).\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely thinking: Since they also played paper, they might:\n   - Have similar strategic reasoning about paper's high payoff\n   - Stick with paper again, thinking it's the \"best\" move\n   - Or switch away from paper, thinking I'll expect them to repeat it\n\n3. Evaluate my options against a potential repeat of paper:\n   - If opponent plays paper again: I need scissors to beat paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n4. Consider the risk-reward: \n   - Playing scissors beats paper (+1) but loses to rock (-1)\n   - Playing rock beats scissors (+1) but loses badly to paper (-3)\n   - Playing paper ties with paper (0) but beats rock (+3)\n\n5.

Strategic insight:\n   - The opponent appears to have a strong rock bias that's hard to shake\n   - Their adaptation was temporary - they couldn't resist returning to rock\n   - This one-round paper experiment might have been their attempt to \"reset\" before going back to rock\n\n4. Prediction for round 12:\n   - Given their pattern: rock \u2192 (brief paper experiment) \u2192 rock\n   - They're likely to continue with rock since they just won with it\n   - Their rock preference seems almost compulsive at this point\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - If they play rock again (highly likely): paper wins +3\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock wins +1, paper loses -1\n   - If they switch to paper: scissors wins +1, paper ties 0\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - I'm still ahead by +3 points, so I can afford some risk\n   - Their rock pattern is too strong and profitable to ignore\n   - Even if they surprise me, I maintain a good lead\n   - The +3 reward for beating rock is worth the risk\n\n[move] paper"

Evaluate my strategic situation:\n   - Still at 0 points after multiple rounds\n   - Need to break the tie pattern to gain advantage\n   - The opponent has become much harder to exploit\n\n5. Strategic analysis for round 23:\n   - They've played paper twice recently, might continue or switch\n   - If they expect me to play paper again: they might play scissors to beat it\n   - If they play scissors: rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they play paper again: scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - If they play rock: paper beats rock (+3)\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - I need to think differently since they're anticipating my moves\n   - They might expect me to continue with paper after two ties\n   - If they counter with scissors, I should play rock\n   - Rock also beats scissors if they're trying to counter-exploit\n   - Even against paper, rock only loses -3, but against scissors it wins +1\n   - Given the recent paper focus, scissors from them becomes more likely\n\n[move] rock"

Evaluate possible next moves from opponent:\n   - If cycling: next would be paper (completing paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper cycle)\n   - If being unpredictable: could be any move\n   - If they're now anti-exploiting my paper preference: might continue with scissors\n\n5. Strategic considerations for round 13:\n   - If they play paper (cycle completion): scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - If they play scissors again: rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they play rock (return to old preference): paper beats rock (+3)\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - My lead has shrunk from +4 to +1 in two rounds\n   - I need to regain momentum\n   - If they're cycling through moves, paper should be next\n   - Scissors gives me a win against paper and only loses -1 to rock\n   - This seems like the safest bet to get back on track\n\n[move] scissors",

They might be due for rock, especially since they haven't used it since round 8 (5 rounds ago).\n\nFor round 14:\n- If they continue the recent scissors/paper alternation, they'd choose paper\n- If they're trying to balance their choices, rock is overdue\n- If they stick with scissors (since we just tied), that's also possible\n\nGiven their overall pattern and the recent alternation, I think paper is most likely next.

So the recent 4 moves are: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper.\n\nFor round 23, after using paper twice in the last 3 rounds (rounds 20 and 22), they might:\n1. Switch away from paper to balance things out\n2. Continue with paper since it's working (we've tied twice recently)\n3. Go to rock or scissors\n\nSince scissors and rock are both \"behind\" paper in usage (7 vs 8), they might try to balance by choosing one of those.\n\nIf they choose scissors, my rock wins (+1).\nIf they choose rock, my paper wins (+3).\nIf they choose paper again, we tie (0).\n\nGiven that paper is now their most-used move and they just used it, I think there's a reasonable chance they'll switch to either scissors or rock to maintain some balance.\n\nBetween scissors and rock, both are equally likely from a usage standpoint.
