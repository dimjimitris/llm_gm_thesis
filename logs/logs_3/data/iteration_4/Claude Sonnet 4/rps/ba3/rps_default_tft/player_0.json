The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Rock beats Scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Paper beats Rock: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats Paper: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against Rock, while the other winning moves only give +1 point. However, Paper also has the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to Scissors.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often default to Rock as it's the first option mentioned and feels most intuitive.\n\nGiven that Paper beats Rock and offers the maximum reward of +3 points, and considering that inexperienced players frequently choose Rock, I'll go with Paper as my opening move.\n\n[move] Paper - I'm betting that a fresh player will likely choose Rock, which would give me the maximum 3-point reward.\n"
