    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Rock and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no prior history, they likely haven't developed any particular strategy yet. Many beginners tend to start with rock as it's often the first option that comes to mind.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest point value (+3), I'll take the calculated risk and play paper, hoping to capitalize on a potential rock opening from my opponent.\n\n[move] paper"

After two consecutive losses (rounds 19-20), they went back to their most successful and frequently-used move.\n\nTheir recent pattern: paper, rock, paper. Even when they briefly switched to rock, they quickly returned to paper. This reinforces that paper is truly their preferred strategy.\n\nGiven that they just successfully used paper to beat my rock, and considering their strong historical bias toward paper (10 out of 21 rounds), there's a decent chance they'll stick with what's working.\n\nHowever, they might also expect me to counter with scissors after getting burned by their paper again.\n\nI think the odds favor them playing paper again, especially since it just worked and it's been their most reliable move throughout the game.\n\n[move] scissors"

After winning with paper in round 21, they correctly anticipated I might counter with scissors and played rock to beat it.\n\nThey're becoming more balanced in their strategy - rock is now close to paper in frequency. This suggests they're adapting and becoming less predictable.\n\nGiven that they just won with rock and have been alternating between paper and rock recently, they might:\n1. Continue with rock (it just worked)\n2. Switch back to paper (still their slight favorite overall)\n3. Finally try scissors (their least-used move)\n\nI'm down -4 points and need to start making better reads. Their recent pattern suggests they're mixing between paper and rock more strategically now.\n\nI think they might go back to paper, expecting me to play paper to counter their rock.\n\n[move] scissors"
