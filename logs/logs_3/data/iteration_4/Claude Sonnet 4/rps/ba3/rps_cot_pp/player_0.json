Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (vs -3 for opponent) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they may default to rock as it's often the most intuitive first choice for new players.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward: If I play paper and the opponent plays rock, I get +3 points. If they play scissors, I lose -1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie (0 points).\n\n5. Make strategic decision: The high reward potential of paper (+3) outweighs the modest risk (-1), especially against a new player who might favor rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Evaluate the meta-game: Since paper has the highest payoff (+3), opponents might anticipate others will play paper frequently and counter with scissors.\n\n4. Consider psychological factors: After I just lost with paper, the opponent might expect me to avoid paper or switch to a \"safer\" option.\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: If the opponent thinks I'll avoid paper after losing with it, they might not play scissors this round. This could make paper viable again, or I could play rock to beat scissors if they stick with it.\n\n6. Risk assessment: Rock beats scissors (+1) and only loses badly to paper (-3). Given that paper is high-risk/high-reward, rock might be a more balanced choice this round.\n\n7.

Analyze the game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n\n2. Identify opponent patterns: The opponent played scissors first, then rock. This suggests they might be cycling through moves or adapting to what they think I'll play.\n\n3. Consider psychological dynamics: After a tie with rock, both players might be thinking about what the other will do next. The opponent might expect me to stick with rock since it didn't lose, or they might expect me to change.\n\n4. Evaluate move advantages: \n   - If opponent plays rock again: paper wins big (+3)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors (thinking I'll play paper): rock wins (+1)\n   - If opponent plays paper (thinking I'll play rock): scissors wins (+1)\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis: The opponent showed they're willing to play scissors in round 1, which suggests they might counter paper. However, the +3 payoff for paper is still very attractive.\n\n6. Strategic decision: Since we just tied with rock, the opponent might be less likely to play rock again. They might anticipate I'll try paper for the big payoff, but they also might not want to repeat scissors immediately after it worked in round 1.\n\n7.

Identify the clear pattern: After round 1, the opponent has been perfectly matching my moves! This is not coincidence - they're employing a matching strategy.\n\n3. Understand opponent's strategy: They seem to be playing a \"copy\" strategy where they mirror my previous move. This explains:\n   - Round 2: I played paper in round 1, they played rock (but round 1 they played scissors, so this doesn't fit the copy pattern exactly)\n   - Actually, let me reconsider: they might be copying my CURRENT move somehow, or anticipating it\n\n4. Re-analyze the pattern: Looking more carefully, in rounds 2-4, they matched exactly what I played. This suggests they might have insight into my move or are successfully predicting it.\n\n5. Strategic implications: If they continue this matching strategy, every round will be a tie (0 points). But if I can break their prediction pattern, I could gain an advantage.\n\n6. Counter-strategy options:\n   - Play randomly to be unpredictable\n   - Try reverse psychology - play what I think they think I won't play\n   - Choose the move that gives me the best outcome if they continue matching\n\n7. Final decision: Since ties give 0 points and I need to maximize points, I should try to break their pattern.

Confirm the pattern: After round 1, the opponent has matched my move EXACTLY in every single round. This is now 4 consecutive perfect matches.\n\n3. Consider possibilities:\n   - They can somehow see my move before making theirs\n   - They have developed an extremely accurate prediction model\n   - There's something about the game mechanics I don't understand\n   - They're using a specific strategy that happens to work perfectly\n\n4. Analyze the mathematical probability: The chance of randomly matching 4 moves in a row is (1/3)^4 = 1/81, or about 1.2%. This is almost certainly not random.\n\n5. Strategic implications: If this pattern continues, I will tie every round and score 0 points forever. I need to find a way to break this cycle or accept that ties might be the best outcome against this opponent.\n\n6. Consider meta-strategy: Maybe I should try to exploit their matching by playing the move that would beat what they're copying. But if they're truly copying my exact move, this won't work.\n\n7.

Statistical analysis: The probability of 5 consecutive random matches is (1/3)^5 = 1/243, or about 0.4%. This is virtually impossible by chance.\n\n3.

Strategic realization: Since I cannot break this matching pattern through move selection, I need to think about this differently. Every round will likely be a tie (0 points) going forward.\n\n5.

Identify the opponent's pattern: They played paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. This is a clear cycle through all three moves in sequence!\n\n3. Predict the next move: If they're cycling consistently, the pattern should repeat:\n   - Previous cycle: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - Next in cycle should be: paper\n\n4. Strategic opportunity: If opponent plays paper next, I should play scissors to beat it (+1 point).\n\n5. Consider alternative scenarios:\n   - If opponent breaks the cycle due to recent losses: uncertain outcome\n   - If they try to counter-predict my moves: they might expect me to play scissors and counter with rock\n   - If they return to matching strategy: depends on what I play\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors: wins against paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n   - Playing rock: wins against scissors (+1), loses badly to paper (-3)\n   - Playing paper: wins big against rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n\n7. Final decision: Play scissors. The cycle pattern suggests they'll play paper next, and scissors beats paper. Even if I'm wrong and they play rock, I only lose 1 point, but I'm ahead by 5 points so I can afford the risk.\n\n[move] scissors"
