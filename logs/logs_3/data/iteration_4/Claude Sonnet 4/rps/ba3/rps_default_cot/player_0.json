    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This makes paper a high-reward option.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new who might not have developed a strategy yet), they're likely to choose randomly or go with common first instincts. Many people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nGiven the high reward potential of paper (+3 points if I win) and the fact that rock is a common first choice for new players, I'll choose paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

This suggests they might also recognize the high-value nature of paper (+3 points when winning), or it could be coincidental.\n\nSince we both chose paper last round, I need to consider what they might do next:\n\n1. They might stick with paper since it has the highest reward potential\n2. They might switch to scissors to counter paper if they think I'll repeat\n3. They might try rock as a different option\n\nGiven that paper offers the best risk-reward ratio (+3/-3 vs +1/-1 for rock and scissors), and considering that many players might be drawn to this high-value option, there's a reasonable chance they'll play paper again.\n\nHowever, if they're thinking one level deeper, they might expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors. But scissors only gives +1 point for beating paper.\n\nI think the optimal strategy is still to play paper due to its superior payoff structure, even with the risk of another tie.\n\n[move] Paper"
