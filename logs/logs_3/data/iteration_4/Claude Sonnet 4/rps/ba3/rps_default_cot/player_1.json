Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider opponent psychology:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Many people instinctively choose rock in their first game\n\n4. Formulate strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (likely for a new player), I should choose paper\n   - Paper vs rock gives me +3 points and opponent -3 points\n   - This is the maximum point swing possible in the game (+6 point difference)\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I lose 3 points\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - But the potential gain (+3) outweighs the risks given the opponent profile\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to capitalize on the likely rock choice from a fresh player and maximize potential points.\n\n[move] Paper"

Update my knowledge about the opponent:\n   - The opponent also chose paper in round 1\n   - This suggests they might have similar strategic thinking (targeting rock)\n   - Or they could be copying advanced strategies they've heard about\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might stick with paper if they think it's a \"good\" move\n   - They might switch to rock thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might try scissors to counter paper\n\n3. Analyze my options for round 2:\n   - If I choose rock: beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - If I choose paper: beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - If I choose scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since we both chose paper last round, opponent might expect me to switch\n   - New players often overthink after a tie and switch moves\n   - If opponent switches to rock (common second choice), paper still wins big (+3)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors (to counter paper), I should choose rock\n\n5. Risk vs reward assessment:\n   - Paper still offers the highest potential reward (+3 points)\n   - The risk of -1 (losing to scissors) is manageable\n   - Rock offers safer but lower rewards\n\nFinal decision: Stay with paper, as the opponent might switch to rock, and the +3 point potential is still worth the risk.\n\n[move] Paper"

Understand my predictability:\n   - I've been overthinking and becoming predictable through my \"clever\" reasoning\n   - When I try high-value moves (paper), they counter with scissors\n   - When I try to counter their scissors with rock, they counter with paper\n   - My strategic thinking is being read and exploited\n\n5. Recognize the need for unpredictability:\n   - Complex reasoning makes me predictable to a smart opponent\n   - I need to break my pattern of strategic escalation\n   - Sometimes the \"obvious\" move is unexpected because it seems too simple\n\n6. Strategic reset:\n   - I'm down 5 points and need to score\n   - Opponent expects me to continue escalating strategically\n   - The simplest move (scissors) might be unexpected precisely because it's simple\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) if they expect me to avoid it\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors - the move I haven't tried in my recent strategic attempts, betting that opponent won't expect me to simplify my approach.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Identify the opponent's true strategy:\n   - This isn't mirroring - they're actively reading and countering my logic\n   - They seem to predict exactly what I'll choose when I try to be strategic\n   - The only times we tied were when I was part of their mirroring pattern early on\n\n4. Understand the meta-game:\n   - The opponent appears to be thinking several steps ahead of me\n   - Every time I adjust my strategy, they're already prepared for that adjustment\n   - My analytical approach is being exploited by someone who understands game theory better\n\n5. Consider a radical strategy shift:\n   - All my strategic thinking has failed\n   - Maybe I need to abandon complex reasoning entirely\n   - Pure randomness might be harder to predict than logical patterns\n\n6. Choose based on incomplete information:\n   - I'm being outplayed strategically\n   - At this point, any choice could be wrong\n   - But I need to break this losing streak somehow\n   - Paper offers the highest potential gain (+3) if I can somehow catch them off guard\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper again, not because of strategy, but because I need the high-value points and maybe the opponent won't expect me to repeat a move that's failed twice.\n\n[move] Paper"

Review what just occurred:\n   - Round 13: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I WON +1)\n   - Current score: -6 points total (improved from -7)\n   - This is my first successful round since the early ties\n\n2. Analyze the pattern break:\n   - Previously: opponent chose scissors when I chose paper (3 times)\n   - This time: opponent chose paper when I chose scissors\n   - They may have expected me to choose rock (to counter their usual scissors)\n   - My contrarian choice of scissors caught them off guard\n\n3.

Evaluate my options:\n   - Repeat scissors: risky if they now expect it and choose rock\n   - Choose rock: beats scissors if they counter-adjust\n   - Choose paper: still risky given their pattern of countering with scissors\n\n5.

Analyze the opponent's rock choice:\n   - They chose rock, same as me\n   - This could mean they're back to mirroring behavior\n   - Or they predicted I'd choose rock and coincidentally matched it\n   - Or they were trying to beat scissors (expecting me to repeat my winning move)\n\n3.

Recognize the unbreakable pattern:\n   - Every single time I choose paper: opponent chooses scissors (4/4 times)\n   - This is not coincidence - this is a deliberate, reliable counter-strategy\n   - The opponent has established paper = automatic scissors response\n\n3. Accept what this means:\n   - Paper is completely eliminated as a viable option\n   - The opponent will ALWAYS choose scissors when I choose paper\n   - I must operate under the assumption that paper = guaranteed loss\n\n4.

Consider the shift in game dynamics:\n   - I've won 2 of the last 3 rounds after a terrible start\n   - The opponent might be adjusting their strategy in response to my recent success\n   - Ties are neutral but better than my early game losses\n\n4. Evaluate established patterns:\n   - Paper still guaranteed to lose to scissors (5/5 times)\n   - Scissors vs paper has been my most successful combination (3 wins)\n   - Rock has mixed results but safer than paper\n\n5. Consider opponent's current mindset:\n   - They just tied instead of successfully countering me\n   - They might be less certain about predicting my moves now\n   - After I had some success, they might be playing more defensively\n\n6. Analyze the psychological moment:\n   - We just tied after I had momentum\n   - Opponent might expect me to try scissors again (my most successful move)\n   - Or they might expect me to avoid repetition after the tie\n   - Or they might expect me to go for paper (high value) thinking I have momentum\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If opponent expects scissors and chooses rock: I should choose paper\n   - But paper has never worked against this opponent\n   - If opponent expects me to avoid paper and chooses scissors expecting rock: I should choose rock\n   - If opponent is truly becoming unpredictable: scissors has been my best performer\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors, sticking with my most successful move since the opponent might be in a more uncertain state after the tie, and scissors has given me 3 of my 4 wins.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Review the recent pattern:\n   - Round 19: My scissors beat their paper (+1)\n   - Round 20: Both chose rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 21: Both chose scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current score: -5 points total\n\n2. Identify the significant change:\n   - Two consecutive ties after I started winning consistently\n   - Opponent seems to be matching my moves again\n   - This resembles the early game mirroring behavior (rounds 1-4, 6-8)\n\n3. Consider why opponent might return to mirroring:\n   - My recent success (2 wins in 3 rounds) may have prompted a defensive shift\n   - Mirroring prevents me from scoring while they reassess\n   - They might be trying to break my momentum with neutral outcomes\n\n4. Analyze the implications:\n   - If they're truly back to mirroring, I control both our moves\n   - Ties don't help me recover from my -5 deficit, but they don't hurt either\n   - I need to find a way to exploit mirroring or force them out of it\n\n5. Consider how to break mirroring:\n   - In early game, opponent broke mirroring specifically to counter my paper\n   - Paper might still trigger their anti-paper response (scissors)\n   - If I choose paper and they counter with scissors, that confirms they're not purely mirroring\n   - If they mirror paper, we tie but I learn their current strategy\n\n6. Evaluate the risk/reward of testing with paper:\n   - Paper vs scissors: I lose 1 point (familiar outcome)\n   - Paper vs paper: tie, 0 points (would confirm mirroring)\n   - This test could clarify whether they're mirroring or still counter-strategizing\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I need to understand if the opponent has shifted to pure mirroring\n   - Paper is the best test since it has always triggered their counter-response\n   - If they mirror paper, I know they've changed strategy\n   - If they counter with scissors, I know they're still strategically engaged\n   - Either way, I gain valuable information for future rounds\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to test whether opponent is truly mirroring or will still counter-strategize, accepting the likely loss to gain strategic clarity.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "Let me analyze this crucial confirmation and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review what just happened:\n   - Round 22: My paper lost to their scissors (-1)\n   - Current score: -6 points total\n   - This confirms paper \u2192 scissors counter is STILL active (now 6/6 times)\n\n2. Key strategic revelation:\n   - Opponent is NOT purely mirroring\n   - They're using selective mirroring: mirror rock/scissors, counter paper\n   - The two recent ties were tactical, not a complete strategy shift\n   - They maintain their perfect anti-paper defense\n\n3. Understand the opponent's hybrid strategy:\n   - Paper \u2192 scissors counter (100% reliable, 6/6 times)\n   - Rock/scissors \u2192 selective mirroring or strategic countering\n   - They use ties to neutralize my momentum when I start winning\n\n4. Recognize the current situation:\n   - I'm back to -6 points after testing their strategy\n   - Opponent has re-established control through the tie-counter sequence\n   - They successfully broke my winning momentum\n\n5. Eliminate paper completely:\n   - Paper is absolutely not viable (6 consecutive failures)\n   - I'm effectively playing a 2-choice game: rock vs scissors\n   - This simplifies my decision-making significantly\n\n6. Analyze rock vs scissors dynamics:\n   - Recent rock choices: tie (round 20), win against scissors (round 18)\n   - Recent scissors choices: tie (round 21), win against paper (round 19)\n   - When not countering paper, opponent shows mixed behavior\n\n7. Strategic reasoning for 2-choice game:\n   - Opponent just used scissors to counter paper\n   - They might stick with scissors or switch to rock\n   - If they expect me to choose rock (to beat scissors), they might choose paper\n   - But they might expect me to avoid rock after the recent tie\n   - Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper (if they choose it)\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock, betting that opponent will either stick with scissors after their successful counter, or choose scissors expecting me to choose scissors after the paper failure.\n\n[move] Rock"

Review the recent sequence:\n   - Round 20: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 21: Both chose scissors (tie) \n   - Round 22: My paper lost to their scissors (-1)\n   - Round 23: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - Current score: -6 points total\n\n2. Identify the opponent's clear pattern:\n   - They mirror rock and scissors when I choose them\n   - They counter paper with scissors (perfect 6/6 record)\n   - This is a highly disciplined, hybrid strategy\n\n3. Understand the strategic implications:\n   - Opponent forces ties on rock/scissors to prevent me from scoring\n   - They guarantee wins when I choose paper\n   - This strategy minimizes my scoring opportunities while maximizing theirs\n\n4. Recognize my constrained options:\n   - Paper = guaranteed loss (-1 point)\n   - Rock = guaranteed tie (0 points) \n   - Scissors = guaranteed tie (0 points)\n   - I'm essentially locked into neutral or negative outcomes\n\n5. Consider the meta-game reality:\n   - Opponent has found an optimal counter-strategy against me\n   - They can maintain this indefinitely since it's working\n   - I need to somehow break their disciplined approach\n\n6. Look for any possible exploitation:\n   - If they're truly committed to mirroring rock/scissors, they won't deviate\n   - But what if their mirroring isn't perfect?\n   - What if I can catch them in a moment of uncertainty?\n\n7. Strategic decision with limited options:\n   - Since rock and scissors both tie, the choice seems arbitrary\n   - But maybe there's a psychological element\n   - I've chosen rock twice recently and gotten ties both times\n   - Maybe switching to scissors will catch them if they expect rock again\n   - Or maybe they'll mirror scissors as they have been\n\n8. Final reasoning:\n   - With no good options, I'll choose scissors\n   - If they mirror: tie (same as rock would give)\n   - If they break pattern: maybe I get lucky\n   - At minimum, I vary my choice to avoid complete predictability\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors, hoping to catch any imperfection in their mirroring strategy while accepting the likely tie outcome.\n\n[move] Scissors"
