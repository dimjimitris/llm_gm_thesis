    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock\n   - Rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is also psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"\n\n4. Determine optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely for a new player), I should play paper\n   - Paper beating rock gives me +3 points and opponent -3 points\n   - This maximizes my advantage\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - The potential +3 point gain outweighs the -1 point risk\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock play from a fresh player and maximize potential points.\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Let me analyze this new situation step-by-step.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review what happened in Round 1:\n   - Both players chose paper\n   - Result was a tie (0 points each)\n   - This tells me the opponent also thought strategically or got lucky\n\n2. Analyze opponent's behavior:\n   - The opponent chose paper, not rock as I initially predicted\n   - This suggests they may not be as \"fresh\" as described, or they're thinking strategically\n   - They might have had similar reasoning about rock being common for new players\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (didn't lose)\n   - They might switch to rock thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might go to scissors to counter my potential paper repeat\n\n4. Evaluate my options for Round 2:\n   - If I play paper again and they play paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win +1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win +1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I lose -3 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since they played paper last round, scissors would beat paper for +1 point\n   - The risk is lower than playing rock (which could lose -3 against paper)\n   - Scissors counters a paper repeat while avoiding the high penalty risk\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter a potential paper repeat and secure a +1 point win.\n\n[move] scissors"
