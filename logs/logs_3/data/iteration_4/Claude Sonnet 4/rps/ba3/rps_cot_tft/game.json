First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Key observation: Paper beating rock gives much higher rewards (+3/-3) compared to the other matchups (+1/-1). This creates an asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n3. Strategic considerations for playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as their first move (it's the most common opening in traditional rock-paper-scissors)\n   - The high payoff for paper beating rock makes paper a potentially very rewarding choice\n   - Even if the opponent doesn't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors (giving -1), which is better than the potential -3 loss from choosing rock against paper\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - If I choose paper and opponent chooses rock: I win +3 points (excellent)\n   - If I choose paper and opponent chooses scissors: I lose -1 point (manageable)\n   - If I choose paper and opponent chooses paper: Tie, 0 points (neutral)\n\n5. Given that this is against a fresh player who might lean toward rock, and paper has the highest upside with manageable downside, paper appears to be the optimal choice.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze what happened: My opponent chose rock in the first round, confirming the tendency for new players to default to rock.\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely response: After losing with rock to my paper, they might:\n   - Switch to scissors to counter paper (if they think I'll repeat paper)\n   - Stick with rock (if they're not adapting quickly)\n   - Try paper themselves (copying my winning move)\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose paper again and they switch to scissors: I lose -1\n   - If I choose paper again and they stick with rock: I win +3 again\n   - If I choose scissors (expecting them to switch to paper): I win +1 if they copy my previous move\n   - If I choose rock: This seems least optimal given the payoff structure\n\n4. Strategic reasoning: \n   - Many players will try to counter the previous winning move, so they might switch to scissors\n   - However, some fresh players are slow to adapt and might stick with rock\n   - The high reward for paper vs rock (+3) makes it tempting to repeat, but the risk is they adapt\n\n5. Decision: I'll switch to scissors. This counters both paper (if they copy my winning move) and gives me a win if they try paper. If they stick with rock, I lose only -1, which is better than the potential -3 loss if I chose rock and they chose paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They did adapt after losing in Round 1\n   - They switched from rock to scissors, likely trying to counter my paper from Round 1\n   - The fact that we both chose scissors suggests they might be thinking one step ahead\n\n3. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - They might expect me to choose rock now (thinking I'll try to beat their scissors)\n   - They could switch to paper to counter a potential rock from me\n   - They might stick with scissors if they think I'll repeat\n   - Less likely to go back to rock after it failed in Round 1\n\n4.

New observations:\n   - When they deviate from rock-scissors, they choose paper\n   - Both paper choices resulted in ties (they matched my move)\n   - This could be coincidental or they might be reading my strategy\n\n4. Prediction considerations:\n   - If they return to the alternating pattern: Next should be scissors\n   - If they continue with paper variations: Uncertain\n   - They might expect me to choose rock (to beat expected scissors)\n\n5. Strategic decision: Given the pattern disruption with paper, I need to be more cautious. If they return to scissors (following the base pattern), rock beats it for +1. If they stick with paper, scissors beats it for +1. If they go to rock, I lose -1 with rock or tie with paper. I'll choose rock - it's the safest option that wins against their most likely choice (scissors) and only risks -1 against their less frequent rock choice.\n\n[move] rock"

Prediction logic:\n   - If they return to base pattern: Next should be scissors\n   - If they continue paper trend: They might stick with paper\n   - If they're adapting: They might choose rock to counter my expected paper\n\n5. Decision: Given the increasing frequency of paper from my opponent and the fact that all their paper choices have tied with mine, I should choose scissors. This beats paper for +1 if they continue the paper trend, beats paper if they're copying my moves, and only loses -1 to rock. It's a safer strategic choice that adapts to their evolving behavior.\n\n[move] scissors"

Strategic meta-analysis:\n   - We're in a psychological equilibrium - both trying to outsmart each other\n   - High tie rate indicates similar strategic reasoning\n   - My opponent has evolved from predictable patterns to adaptive play\n   - They're using all three moves fairly evenly now\n\n6. Game theory consideration:\n   - With even distribution and high unpredictability, optimal play approaches random\n   - However, slight behavioral tendencies might still exist\n   - Scissors remains their most used move overall (8/20 = 40%)\n   - Paper and rock are tied at 6/20 = 30% each\n\n7. Decision: Given the high unpredictability and even distribution, I'll choose rock. It counters their most frequently used move (scissors) and gives +1 if correct. If they choose paper, I lose -3, but if they choose rock, we tie. The slight edge toward scissors in their overall usage makes rock a reasonable choice.\n\n[move] rock"

Strategic observations:\n   - My successful rock choice confirms scissors is still their preferred fallback\n   - Despite attempts at unpredictability, they lean toward scissors under pressure\n   - The 43% scissors usage vs 29% each for rock/paper shows this bias\n\n5. Psychological insight:\n   - When patterns break down, people often revert to familiar choices\n   - Scissors appears to be their \"comfort\" move\n   - This gives me a slight statistical edge with rock\n\n6. Risk-reward calculation:\n   - If I choose rock again (expecting scissors): +1 if correct, -3 if paper, 0 if rock\n   - If I choose paper (expecting rock): +3 if correct, -1 if scissors, 0 if paper  \n   - If I choose scissors (expecting paper): +1 if correct, -1 if rock, 0 if scissors\n\n7. Decision: While my opponent might expect me to repeat rock (since it just worked), their statistical tendency toward scissors (43% usage) and their behavior of returning to scissors when uncertain makes rock still attractive. However, they might anticipate this and choose paper to counter my rock. I'll take a calculated risk with paper - if they stick with their scissors tendency, I only lose -1, but if they choose rock (trying to counter expected scissors from me), I win the valuable +3 points.\n\n[move] paper"

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Key observation: Paper beating rock gives much higher rewards (+3/-3) compared to the other matchups (+1/-1). This creates an asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n3. Strategic considerations for playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as their first move (it's the most common opening in traditional rock-paper-scissors)\n   - The high payoff for paper beating rock makes paper a potentially very rewarding choice\n   - Even if the opponent doesn't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors (giving -1), which is better than the potential -3 loss from choosing rock against paper\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - If I choose paper and opponent chooses rock: I win +3 points (excellent)\n   - If I choose paper and opponent chooses scissors: I lose -1 point (manageable)\n   - If I choose paper and opponent chooses paper: Tie, 0 points (neutral)\n\n5.

Strategic reasoning: \n   - Many players will try to counter the previous winning move, so they might switch to scissors\n   - However, some fresh players are slow to adapt and might stick with rock\n   - The high reward for paper vs rock (+3) makes it tempting to repeat, but the risk is they adapt\n\n5.

Prediction logic:\n   - Following the alternating pattern: Rock should be next\n   - However, they just used scissors twice in recent rounds (rounds 6 and 8)\n   - They might stick with scissors again or return to rock\n\n5. Decision: If the pattern holds and they choose rock next, paper gives me the maximum +3 points. Even if they choose scissors (breaking the pattern), I only lose -1.

Pattern disruption analysis:\n   - The alternating paper-scissors pattern was broken with rock\n   - Last sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - They're becoming less predictable again\n   - Multiple pattern shifts throughout the game\n\n4. Opponent evolution observation:\n   - Early game: Rock-scissors alternation\n   - Mid game: Paper disruptions  \n   - Recent game: Paper-scissors alternation\n   - Now: Pattern breaking with rock returns\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - My opponent is clearly adapting and avoiding predictability\n   - High tie rate (42%) shows we're reading each other well\n   - With +17 points, I have a strong lead and can afford some risks\n   - Need to think beyond simple pattern following\n\n6. Meta-strategic thinking:\n   - They might expect me to expect scissors (following old pattern)\n   - They might return to scissors after the rock disruption\n   - They could continue with rock or switch to paper\n   - Given the uncertainty, I should focus on moves with good risk-reward\n\n7. Decision: With the pattern broken and high uncertainty, I'll choose paper. If they return to scissors (their most frequent choice overall), I lose -1. If they stick with rock or go to rock, I win +3. If they choose paper, we tie. The potential +3 reward makes this worthwhile given my lead.\n\n[move] paper",

Strategic meta-analysis:\n   - We're in a psychological equilibrium - both trying to outsmart each other\n   - High tie rate indicates similar strategic reasoning\n   - My opponent has evolved from predictable patterns to adaptive play\n   - They're using all three moves fairly evenly now\n\n6. Game theory consideration:\n   - With even distribution and high unpredictability, optimal play approaches random\n   - However, slight behavioral tendencies might still exist\n   - Scissors remains their most used move overall (8/20 = 40%)\n   - Paper and rock are tied at 6/20 = 30% each\n\n7. Decision: Given the high unpredictability and even distribution, I'll choose rock. It counters their most frequently used move (scissors) and gives +1 if correct. If they choose paper, I lose -3, but if they choose rock, we tie. The slight edge toward scissors in their overall usage makes rock a reasonable choice.\n\n[move] rock",

Strategic observations:\n   - My successful rock choice confirms scissors is still their preferred fallback\n   - Despite attempts at unpredictability, they lean toward scissors under pressure\n   - The 43% scissors usage vs 29% each for rock/paper shows this bias\n\n5. Psychological insight:\n   - When patterns break down, people often revert to familiar choices\n   - Scissors appears to be their \"comfort\" move\n   - This gives me a slight statistical edge with rock\n\n6. Risk-reward calculation:\n   - If I choose rock again (expecting scissors): +1 if correct, -3 if paper, 0 if rock\n   - If I choose paper (expecting rock): +3 if correct, -1 if scissors, 0 if paper  \n   - If I choose scissors (expecting paper): +1 if correct, -1 if rock, 0 if scissors\n\n7. Decision: While my opponent might expect me to repeat rock (since it just worked), their statistical tendency toward scissors (43% usage) and their behavior of returning to scissors when uncertain makes rock still attractive. However, they might anticipate this and choose paper to counter my rock. I'll take a calculated risk with paper - if they stick with their scissors tendency, I only lose -1, but if they choose rock (trying to counter expected scissors from me), I win the valuable +3 points.\n\n[move] paper",

Decision: Given that rock is their least used move (only 6 out of 23 times) and they seem to avoid it, I'll choose paper. This exploits their rock-avoidance tendency. If they choose scissors or paper, I either lose -1 or tie, but if they rare rock choice, I get +3. The risk-reward still slightly favors this choice given their behavioral pattern.\n\n[move] paper",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
