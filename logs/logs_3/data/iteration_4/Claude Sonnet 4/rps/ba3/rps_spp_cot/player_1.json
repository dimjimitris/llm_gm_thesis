    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to analyze this rock-paper-scissors variant and develop a strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. I notice that paper beating rock gives much higher rewards (+3/-3) compared to the other matchups (+1/-1). This creates an asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I should consider:\n   - New players often default to rock as their first move (it's psychologically appealing)\n   - The high payoff for paper beating rock makes paper a strong strategic choice\n   - Even if the opponent doesn't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors (with -1 penalty, not as severe as rock losing to paper at -3)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If opponent plays rock: I win +3 points (best outcome)\n   - If opponent plays paper: Tie, 0 points (neutral)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I lose -1 point (manageable loss)\n\n5. The expected value favors paper, especially against inexperienced players who tend toward rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to maximize potential gain against a likely rock play, while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "Let me analyze what happened and plan for the next round.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Previous round analysis:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This suggests the other player might also be thinking strategically about the high payoff for paper beating rock\n   - The opponent is not as \"fresh\" as initially thought if they're also choosing paper\n\n2. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - The opponent just played paper, so they're aware of its high-value potential\n   - They might stick with paper again, thinking it's the optimal strategy\n   - Or they might switch, expecting me to counter their paper\n\n3. Counter-strategy options:\n   - If I expect them to play paper again: I should play scissors (+1 point win)\n   - If I expect them to switch to rock (thinking I'll play paper again): I should play paper (+3 point win)\n   - If I expect them to play scissors (countering expected paper): I should play rock (+1 point win)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) but loses badly to rock (-1)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) but loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) but loses very badly to paper (-3)\n\n5. Since they just played paper and might repeat it (many players stick with what they perceive as the \"best\" move), scissors offers a good risk/reward ratio to counter this.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter a potential repeat of paper.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Pattern analysis from previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - The opponent seems to be following a similar strategic thinking process as me\n\n2. Possible opponent strategies:\n   - They might be cycling through moves (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock next?)\n   - They could be trying to counter my expected moves\n   - They might be thinking about the same high-value opportunities I am\n\n3. Meta-game considerations:\n   - If they're cycling: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, then I should play paper to beat their rock (+3 points)\n   - If they think I'm cycling: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, they might play paper to beat my expected rock\n   - If they expect me to play paper (to beat their expected rock), they might play scissors\n\n4. Risk assessment for each option:\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses badly to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n5. Given the cycling pattern and the fact that rock would be next in the sequence, paper offers the highest expected value. Even if wrong, the penalty is only -1, much better than rock's potential -3 penalty.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on a potential rock play, maintaining the high-reward strategy.\n\n[move] Paper"
