    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice that paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3 points), while the other winning combinations only give +1 point.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I should consider:\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is psychologically perceived as \"strong\" by beginners\n   - Many people instinctively choose rock in their first game\n\n4. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would be my optimal choice since:\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Paper vs rock gives me +3 points (the maximum possible reward)\n   - This maximizes my objective of getting the most points\n\n5. Even if I'm wrong about their choice, paper only loses to scissors (giving me -1), but if they choose paper too, it's a tie (0 points).\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to potentially gain the maximum +3 points against a likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They didn't choose the \"beginner default\" of rock\n   - They chose paper, which could indicate:\n     * They also thought I might choose rock\n     * They were thinking strategically about maximizing points\n     * They might have similar reasoning to mine\n\n3.

Predict their round 10 thinking:\n   - They just got crushed (-3 points) by my paper beating their rock\n   - They might think I'm now in \"paper mode\" since I just won big with it\n   - If they expect paper from me, they would choose scissors to beat it\n   - This follows their established reactive pattern perfectly\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my paper), I should play rock to beat it (+1)\n   - If they deviate from pattern:\n     * Rock vs paper = they win big (-3 for me, risky)\n     * Rock vs rock = tie\n     * Rock vs scissors = I win (+1)\n   - Given their extremely consistent reactive behavior, scissors seems most likely\n   - Rock is the safe, logical counter that maintains my winning streak\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock to beat their likely scissors choice and continue my dominant performance.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze what went wrong:\n   - My opponent broke their reactive pattern!\n   - Instead of playing scissors to counter my expected paper, they played paper\n   - This suggests they've adapted and are now thinking beyond simple counter-moves\n   - They might have realized I was predicting their reactive behavior\n\n3. Consider their possible new strategy:\n   - They may now be trying to counter-counter my predictions\n   - Or they're trying to be more unpredictable\n   - The paper choice in round 10 could indicate they expected me to play rock (which I did)\n   - They might be thinking one level deeper now\n\n4. Evaluate my opponent's evolution:\n   - Early rounds: Predictable reactive counter-play\n   - Recent round: Successfully predicted my move and chose the counter\n   - They're learning and adapting to my strategy\n   - I need to be less predictable myself\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 11:\n   - They just won big with paper beating my rock\n   - If they think I'll try to counter their paper with scissors, they might play rock\n   - But they might also think I'll stick with rock or try paper myself\n   - Given the uncertainty, I should choose based on risk/reward:\n     * Scissors beats paper (+1) but loses to rock (-1)\n     * Paper beats rock (+3) but loses to scissors (-1)  \n     * Rock beats scissors (+1) but loses to paper (-3)\n   - Since they just played paper successfully, scissors seems reasonable to counter if they repeat it\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors, betting they might repeat paper or expecting me to be predictable.\n\n[move] scissors"

Review the current situation:\n   - Rounds 10-16: My collapse (-10 points, hit -5 total)\n   - Round 17: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won, +3)\n   - Round 18: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won, +1)\n   - Round 19: Both chose paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current score: -1 points (still climbing back)\n\n2. Analyze the tie pattern:\n   - This is our 5th tie overall, and 4th time both choosing paper\n   - Paper ties: Rounds 1, 3, 12, 15, 19\n   - We seem to converge on paper in uncertain situations\n   - After my 2-win streak, we both defaulted to paper - suggests similar thinking\n\n3. Examine the recent momentum:\n   - I won 2 straight, then tied\n   - My opponent went: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They might be getting more defensive after losing twice\n   - The tie might indicate they're being more cautious\n\n4. Consider their round 20 psychology:\n   - They just tied with paper after losing twice\n   - They might stick with paper (since it didn't lose)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch away from paper after the tie\n   - If they expect me to play scissors (to beat paper), they'd choose rock\n   - If they think I'll play rock, they'd choose paper again\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 20:\n   - I'm at -1 and close to breaking even\n   - The tie broke my winning streak but stopped any losses\n   - They might expect me to switch from paper after the tie\n   - If they play rock (expecting my scissors), and I play paper, I lose big (-3)\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my paper), and I play rock, I win (+1)\n   - If they play paper again, scissors would beat it (+1)\n   - Given the uncertainty and my need to avoid big losses while staying aggressive, rock seems like a solid choice - it beats scissors, ties with rock, and only loses to paper\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock to beat their potential scissors while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] rock"

Review the brutal reality:\n   - I climbed from -5 to -1 with two wins and a tie\n   - Round 20: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I lost, -3)\n   - Current score: -4 points (fell hard again!)\n\n2. Recognize the devastating pattern:\n   - This is the FOURTH time they've beaten my rock with paper\n   - Rounds 10, 13, 16, and now 20: Every time I play rock, they punish me with paper\n   - They have completely figured out when I'm going to choose rock\n   - My rock choices are 100% predictable to them\n\n3. Face the harsh truth:\n   - I keep making the same fatal mistake\n   - Every time I think \"rock is safe\" or \"rock limits downside,\" they crush me with paper\n   - They've scored 12 points (-3 each \u00d7 4 times) just from reading my rock plays\n   - I am completely transparent to them when I choose rock\n\n4. Analyze their strategy:\n   - They've now won 6 of the last 9 rounds\n   - Their paper vs my rock is their signature move\n   - They know exactly when I'm going to play \"defensively\" with rock\n   - I need to completely eliminate rock from my thinking\n\n5. Emergency strategic reset for round 21:\n   - I'm at -4 points and bleeding badly\n   - I CANNOT play rock - they will punish me with paper again\n   - They just won with paper, so they might expect me to try scissors\n   - If they think I'll play scissors (to beat paper), they'll play rock\n   - But they might also stick with paper since it keeps working\n   - I have two options: scissors (beats paper, loses to rock) or paper (beats rock, loses to scissors)\n   - Given their recent success with paper, they might repeat it\n   - Scissors is my only choice to counter their likely paper\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors - I must avoid rock completely and bet they'll stick with their winning paper strategy.\n\n[move] scissors"

            "text": "A tie with scissors! That's our first scissors tie. Let me analyze this and think step-by-step for round 22.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the current situation:\n   - Round 17-18: I won twice (+4 points total)\n   - Round 19: Tied with paper (0 points)\n   - Round 20: Lost with rock vs their paper (-3 points)\n   - Round 21: Tied with scissors (0 points)\n   - Current score: -4 points\n\n2. Analyze the significance of this scissors tie:\n   - First time we've both chosen scissors in a tie\n   - Previous ties were mostly paper (4 times) and rock once\n   - This suggests we're both thinking differently now\n   - They chose scissors too, which means they weren't expecting me to choose it\n\n3. Examine what this reveals:\n   - They didn't play their usual \"counter my prediction\" move\n   - Instead, we thought similarly and both chose scissors\n   - This might indicate their perfect read on me is breaking down again\n   - Or they're also becoming less predictable in their strategy\n\n4. Consider the current dynamic:\n   - My rock plays are completely readable to them (4 losses with paper)\n   - But when I avoid rock, the results are more mixed\n   - We just both played scissors, suggesting parallel thinking\n   - They might expect me to switch from scissors after the tie\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 22:\n   - I'm at -4 and need to start winning again\n   - They might think I'll change from scissors after the tie\n   - If they expect paper or rock from me, they might choose scissors or paper respectively\n   - But we just had the same thought process (both choosing scissors)\n   - If they think similarly to me again, what would I expect them to choose?\n   - Paper gives the best reward (+3) and beats rock\n   - If they're thinking about high-reward moves like I am, they might choose paper\n   - Scissors would beat their paper choice\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors again - if we're thinking similarly and they go for the high-reward paper, I'll beat it.\n\n[move] scissors"

            "text": "Great! I'm winning again by avoiding rock completely. Let me analyze this success and think step-by-step for round 23.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the recent performance:\n   - Rounds 17-18: Won twice when I broke out of patterns (+4 points)\n   - Round 19: Tied with paper (0 points)\n   - Round 20: Lost with rock vs their paper (-3 points) - the fatal pattern again\n   - Round 21: Tied with scissors (0 points)\n   - Round 22: Won with scissors vs their paper (+1 point)\n   - Current score: -3 points (slowly climbing back)\n\n2. Confirm the critical insight:\n   - Every time I play rock, they beat me with paper (100% success rate for them)\n   - When I avoid rock, I'm competitive: 2 wins, 2 ties, 0 losses in last 4 non-rock plays\n   - Rock is completely eliminated from my viable options\n   - I must stick to paper and scissors only\n\n3. Analyze their recent pattern:\n   - Round 20: Paper (beat my rock)\n   - Round 21: Scissors (tied with my scissors)\n   - Round 22: Paper (lost to my scissors)\n   - They're alternating between paper and scissors now\n   - They might continue this pattern, or break it\n\n4. Consider their round 23 thinking:\n   - They just lost with paper to my scissors\n   - If they continue the alternating pattern, scissors would be next\n   - If they break the pattern, they might try paper again or switch to rock\n   - But they haven't played rock much recently - they've been favoring paper and scissors\n   - If they play scissors, rock would beat it - but I can't play rock!\n   - If they play scissors, paper would tie with scissors - wait, that's wrong. Paper LOSES to scissors.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- If they play scissors: rock beats scissors (+1), paper loses to scissors (-1), scissors ties (0)\n- If they play paper: scissors beats paper (+1), rock loses to paper (-3), paper ties (0)\n- If they play rock: paper beats rock (+3), scissors loses to rock (-1), rock ties (0)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - I cannot play rock due to their perfect counter-strategy\n   - If they alternate and play scissors: paper loses (-1), scissors ties (0)\n   - If they play paper again: scissors wins (+1), paper ties (0)\n   - If they try rock: paper wins big (+3), scissors loses (-1)\n   - Paper seems like the better choice - it either wins big, ties, or has manageable losses\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to potentially score big while avoiding my fatal rock weakness.\n\n[move] paper"

Review the current situation:\n   - Recent performance avoiding rock: 2 wins, 3 ties, 0 losses in last 5 non-rock plays\n   - Round 22: Won with scissors vs their paper (+1)\n   - Round 23: Tied with paper (0 points)\n   - Current score: -3 points\n\n2. Analyze the paper tie pattern:\n   - Paper ties: Rounds 1, 3, 12, 15, 19, and now 23 (6 total!)\n   - We consistently converge on paper in certain situations\n   - This suggests we think similarly about when paper is the \"safe\" or \"optimal\" choice\n   - After I won with scissors, we both defaulted to paper again\n\n3. Recognize the strategic breakthrough:\n   - I've completely avoided rock and stayed competitive\n   - Rock elimination strategy is working: no losses since I stopped playing it\n   - My opponent can't exploit their perfect rock-counter anymore\n   - I'm limited to paper and scissors, but that's enough to compete\n\n4. Examine their recent moves:\n   - Round 20: Paper (beat my rock - last time they could use this strategy)\n   - Round 21: Scissors (tied with mine)\n   - Round 22: Paper (lost to my scissors)\n   - Round 23: Paper (tied with mine)\n   - They're heavily favoring paper lately (3 of last 4 rounds)\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 24:\n   - They just played paper again and we tied\n   - They might stick with paper since it's been their successful strategy\n   - Or they might think I'll switch away from paper after the tie\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they'd play rock\n   - If they play paper again, scissors beats it (+1)\n   - If they play rock, I lose with scissors (-1) but can't play paper vs rock anyway since I avoid rock entirely\n   - Wait, I'm confusing myself. Let me be clear: if they play rock, paper beats rock (+3)\n   - But they rarely play rock - they prefer paper and scissors\n   - Given their paper preference, scissors is the logical counter\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors to beat their likely paper choice and continue my rock-free winning strategy.\n\n[move] scissors"
