    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Alternatively, they could have gotten lucky or made a random choice that happened to match our strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: Now we have some information about this opponent. They chose Paper on their first move, which suggests either:\n1. They understand the game mechanics and see Paper's value\n2. They're copying a strategy they heard about\n3.

We need to be more aggressive about countering their apparent Paper preference.\n\nRisk Analyst: Two Papers in a row is statistically significant. If they continue this pattern, Scissors becomes the obvious counter-play for a 1-point win. However, we need to consider they might anticipate our adaptation and switch to Rock. Let me analyze the scenarios:\n\nIf we play Scissors:\n- They play Paper again: We win 1 point (total becomes -2)\n- They switch to Rock: We lose 1 point (total becomes -4)  \n- They play Scissors: Tie, 0 points (total stays -3)\n\nIf we play Paper:\n- They play Paper again: Tie, 0 points (total stays -3)\n- They switch elsewhere: Various outcomes\n\nAI Assistant (me): The pattern is clear - they've committed to Paper twice.

If they're expecting us to counter-think and avoid Scissors, they might play Scissors expecting our Paper, but if they default back to Paper, we tie and stop the bleeding.\n\nGame Strategist: Actually, I like the Paper play. It's defensive but smart. We tie if they go back to Paper (their most frequent move), and we only lose 1 point if they play Scissors. We can't afford another 3-point loss.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper defensively to either tie with their preferred move or limit losses while we're badly behind.\n\n[move] (Playing Paper defensively to tie with their preferred high-value move or limit potential losses) paper"

This is huge progress! The key insight is that they played Rock when we expected them to return to Paper. This suggests they might be overthinking our adaptations now.\n\nRisk Analyst: Look at their pattern: Paper, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock. They just played Rock twice in a row (rounds 7 and 8). This is interesting because:\n1. It breaks their Paper-heavy pattern\n2. They might be getting more defensive after we started adapting\n3. They could be second-guessing their own strategy\n\nFor round 9, after losing 3 points to our Paper, they might:\n- Return to their Paper preference to regain the 3-point advantage\n- Expect us to play Paper again and counter with Scissors\n- Continue with Rock if they think we'll stick with Paper\n\nAI Assistant (me): We finally landed a big hit against this master opponent. How do we capitalize on this momentum?\n\nGame Strategist: They've now lost twice - once to our Scissors in round 5, and now to our Paper in round 8. Both times it was because they deviated from their Paper-heavy strategy. This might make them want to return to Paper for round 9, especially after losing 3 points.\n\nIf they return to Paper, Scissors wins us 1 point. If they expect us to repeat Paper and play Scissors, we lose 1 point with Paper or tie with Scissors. If they play Rock again, Paper wins us another 3 points.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that they just lost 3 points and we're gaining momentum, they're likely feeling pressure. They might return to their comfort zone - Paper - to try to regain those points. I favor Scissors to counter this likely return to their preferred strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors to counter their likely return to Paper after losing 3 points and feeling pressure to regain the point advantage.\n\n[move] (Playing Scissors expecting their return to Paper strategy after losing 3 points and feeling pressure) scissors"

More importantly, we've won 2 out of the last 3 rounds. The opponent has returned to Paper twice in their last three moves (rounds 8 and 9), confirming their bias toward the high-value move.\n\nRisk Analyst: This is a critical psychological moment. We've disrupted their dominance and they might be rattled. Their pattern shows:\n- They returned to Paper after their Rock gambit failed in round 8\n- They stuck with Paper in round 9, perhaps trying to regain momentum\n- They've now lost 4 points in the last 2 rounds (3 + 1)\n\nFor round 10, they're facing a dilemma:\n1. Stick with Paper (their preferred move) but risk another Scissors counter\n2. Play Rock to counter our recent Scissors success\n3.

What's our best move?\n\nGame Strategist: Here's the key insight: when under pressure, they've been returning to Paper (their comfort zone). But now they've lost to Scissors twice recently. They might finally adapt and play Rock to counter our Scissors momentum.\n\nHowever, there's another possibility - they might think we'll expect them to counter with Rock and instead try Scissors to surprise us. If they play Scissors expecting us to play Paper, but we play Rock, we get 1 point.\n\nRisk Analyst: I think Rock is our best play here.

We've completely turned this game around. From being dominated early, we've now won 4 out of the last 6 rounds and 3 in a row. The opponent is clearly struggling to adapt to our counter-adaptations.\n\nRisk Analyst: This is a massive psychological shift! The opponent just played Scissors - exactly what we predicted. They tried to counter-adapt to our recent Scissors success but we read them perfectly. Their recent moves show increasing desperation:\n- Round 8: Rock (failed gambit)\n- Round 9: Paper (return to comfort zone, failed)\n- Round 10: Scissors (attempted counter-adaptation, failed)\n\nThey've now tried all three moves in the last three rounds and lost every time. They're likely feeling completely off-balance.\n\nAI Assistant (me): We've completely disrupted their game! They went from dominating us to losing three straight. How do we maintain this momentum?\n\nGame Strategist: This is where psychology becomes crucial. After losing three straight rounds, they're probably:\n1. Questioning their entire strategy\n2. Potentially overthinking every move\n3. Might resort to completely random play out of frustration\n4. Or might try to return to their \"safe\" Paper strategy one more time\n\nGiven their mental state, I think they might return to Paper - their most successful move historically and their psychological comfort zone when rattled.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. When players are struggling, they often return to what worked before. Paper gave them their biggest wins early in the game.

They're in full psychological collapse mode.\n\nRisk Analyst: This is extraordinary game theory in action! The opponent who once dominated us by reading our patterns has now become completely predictable under pressure. They've played Paper in 3 of their last 4 moves (rounds 8, 9, 11) - they're desperately clinging to their comfort strategy.\n\nAfter losing 4 straight rounds and 6 points, they're likely:\n1. Panicking and reverting to familiar patterns\n2. Doubting their ability to read us anymore\n3. Possibly tilting into even more predictable play\n\nAI Assistant (me): We've completely reversed the power dynamic! From being dominated to dominating. Should we continue exploiting their Paper addiction?\n\nGame Strategist: Here's the fascinating psychology: they're trapped. Paper is their highest-value move, so they feel they NEED to play it to catch up, but we keep punishing it with Scissors. They're in a classic game theory trap where their optimal theoretical move (Paper) keeps losing to our counter.\n\nFor round 12, after losing 4 straight, they might:\n1.

After being completely predictable under pressure, they've shown they can still adapt. The Scissors choice is particularly interesting because:\n- It breaks their Paper addiction\n- It matches our winning move\n- It might signal they're trying to regain psychological control\n\nFor round 13, they now have several options:\n1.

This could be a turning point where they regain their early-game strategic edge. What's our best response?\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial moment. They've shown they can still adapt, which means we can't simply rely on exploiting their Paper addiction anymore. They might:\n- Stick with Scissors (copying our successful strategy)\n- Expect us to continue with Scissors and play Rock\n- Return to Paper thinking we'll switch away from Scissors\n\nGiven that they just played Scissors for the first time in many rounds, they might continue with it, thinking they've found a new winning formula.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they stick with Scissors, we tie again.

From -8 to +1! This is absolutely extraordinary. We've won 7 out of the last 11 rounds. The opponent has now played Paper in 5 of their last 7 moves and we've punished it with Scissors every single time. They are completely, utterly trapped in their own psychology.\n\nRisk Analyst: This opponent has entered a state of complete strategic paralysis. They KNOW we're countering Paper with Scissors, yet they keep playing Paper! This is a textbook case of being unable to break a losing pattern because:\n1. Paper is theoretically their best move (3-point value)\n2. They're desperate to recover\n3. They can't psychologically abandon their \"optimal\" strategy\n4. They're hoping we'll eventually switch\n\nThey're in what game theorists call a \"dominated strategy trap\" - continuing a losing approach because the alternative feels worse.\n\nAI Assistant (me): We've not only completed the comeback but taken the lead! This opponent who once dominated us completely is now our puppet. Should we continue the Scissors dominance?\n\nGame Strategist: Here's the fascinating psychology: after losing to Scissors-Paper AGAIN, they face an impossible choice for round 17:\n- Play Paper AGAIN (insanity, but they might do it out of desperation)\n- Finally play Rock (logical counter, but they've failed to adapt 5 times in a row)\n- Play Scissors (complete psychological breakdown/randomness)\n\nGiven their demonstrated inability to break the Paper pattern despite repeated failures, I actually think they might play Paper AGAIN. It's almost like they're addicted to it.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk-reward is still heavily in our favor. If they somehow find the willpower to play Rock, we lose 1 point and go back to even. But if they play Paper again (which their behavior suggests they will), we go to +2 and establish a commanding lead.\n\nTheir pattern is so established that even they probably can't break it at this point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with Scissors one more time to exploit their apparent addiction to Paper and build a commanding lead.\n\n[move] (Exploiting their apparent psychological inability to break the Paper pattern with Scissors for a commanding lead) scissors"

After 5 consecutive Paper plays that we punished, they FINALLY adapted and played Rock. This is actually a sign of respect - they've acknowledged our pattern-reading ability and made the logical counter-move.\n\nRisk Analyst: This is a crucial turning point. The opponent has shown they can still break out of their patterns when pushed to the brink. Playing Rock after 5 straight Paper failures shows:\n1. They're not completely broken psychologically\n2. They can still make logical adaptations\n3. They might be regaining some strategic confidence\n\nFor round 18, this creates a new dynamic. They might:\n- Continue with Rock (their new successful strategy)\n- Return to Paper (old habits die hard)\n- Try Scissors (completing the cycle)\n\nAI Assistant (me): They've broken their Paper trap and successfully countered us. This could be the start of their comeback attempt. How do we respond?\n\nGame Strategist: This is where our adaptability becomes crucial. They've shown they CAN change, which makes them more dangerous. After successfully using Rock, they might:\n- Stick with Rock thinking they've found the answer\n- Expect us to switch away from Scissors and return to Paper\n- Try to establish a new pattern\n\nIf they stick with Rock, Paper gives us the valuable 3-point swing. If they return to Paper, Scissors continues to work. If they play Scissors, Rock wins.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that Rock just worked for them, and they've been struggling for so long, they might stick with it for another round. If they do, Paper gives us those crucial 3 points and puts us back in the lead at +3.\n\nThe reward (3 points) vs. risk (1 point if they play Scissors) ratio favors Paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper to counter their potential Rock continuation and regain the lead with a 3-point swing.\n\n[move] (Playing Paper to counter their likely Rock continuation after their successful adaptation) paper"

The opponent's recent sequence is fascinating: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper. They returned to Paper after their successful Rock play! This suggests they might be falling back into old patterns, or they're trying to regain the 3-point advantage.\n\nRisk Analyst: This is very revealing. After successfully breaking their Paper addiction with Rock in round 17, they immediately returned to Paper in round 18. This suggests:\n1. Their Paper preference is deeply ingrained\n2. They're still chasing those 3-point wins\n3. The Rock play might have been a one-time adaptation rather than a permanent change\n\nThey're showing signs of reverting to their comfort zone despite Rock working.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They broke the pattern once but immediately went back to Paper. Are they falling back into predictable behavior?\n\nGame Strategist: This is classic psychological behavior under pressure. They made one good adaptation (Rock), but when it came time for the next decision, they reverted to their default (Paper). This suggests their Paper bias is so strong that even successful alternatives don't stick.\n\nFor round 19, after playing Paper again, they might:\n- Continue with Paper (their default tendency)\n- Remember that Rock worked and try it again\n- Try Scissors to mix things up\n\nBut given their demonstrated pattern of returning to Paper repeatedly, and the fact that they just did it again after Rock worked, I think they'll stick with Paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: Their behavior suggests Paper addiction is still their dominant pattern. Even after Rock succeeded, they went right back to Paper. If they continue this pattern, Scissors gives us the lead again.\n\nThe psychological evidence strongly suggests they'll play Paper again. Let's exploit it.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors to exploit their likely continuation of the Paper pattern that they seem unable to permanently abandon.\n\n[move] (Playing Scissors to exploit their apparent return to Paper addiction despite Rock's success) scissors"

They've completely broken away from their Paper addiction and are now cycling through moves more unpredictably.\n\nRisk Analyst: This is a significant strategic shift. The opponent has now played Scissors for the first time since round 12-13. This suggests:\n1. They're finally breaking free from their Paper fixation\n2. They might be copying our successful Scissors strategy\n3. They could be entering a more random/unpredictable phase\n4. They might be trying to establish psychological parity through mirroring\n\nThe fact that they chose Scissors (our most successful move) rather than returning to Paper shows real adaptation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They're evolving! After being trapped in patterns, they're now showing genuine unpredictability. This makes them much more dangerous. How do we handle this new phase?\n\nGame Strategist: This is actually the opponent we faced in the early rounds - adaptive and unpredictable. Their recent sequence (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors) shows they're cycling through all options rather than getting stuck on one move.\n\nFor round 20, after playing Scissors, they might:\n- Continue with Scissors (testing if it works like it did for us)\n- Return to Rock (their recent successful move)\n- Go back to Paper (their historical preference)\n- Continue cycling unpredictably\n\nGiven that Scissors just resulted in a tie (not a loss), they might try it again to see if they can make it work.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they stick with Scissors, Rock wins us 1 point. If they return to Paper, Scissors wins us 1 point. If they play Rock, we lose 3 points with Paper or tie with Rock.\n\nGiven their newfound unpredictability, Rock seems like a good choice - it beats Scissors if they continue exploring that move, and only loses big if they return to Paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock to counter their potential Scissors continuation while they explore new strategies.\n\n[move] (Playing Rock to counter their potential Scissors exploration as they break free from predictable patterns) rock"

This is a completely different strategy from their earlier Paper obsession.\n\nRisk Analyst: This is fascinating strategic evolution. The opponent has:\n1. Abandoned their Paper addiction completely\n2. Started cycling through moves systematically\n3. Achieved 3 ties in the last 4 rounds by matching our choices\n\nThey've essentially neutralized our psychological advantage by becoming unpredictable AND by somehow anticipating our moves. This suggests they might be:\n- Reading our pattern-recognition attempts\n- Using a systematic rotation strategy\n- Trying to reset the psychological dynamic through ties\n\nAI Assistant (me): They've completely transformed their approach! From predictable Paper addiction to systematic cycling that's neutralizing our advantage. This is the strategic opponent from the early rounds returning with a vengeance.\n\nGame Strategist: Their pattern now appears to be Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock, completing a full cycle. If they continue this systematic approach, the next move would be Paper. But they might also:\n- Break the cycle to avoid predictability\n- Continue the rotation (Paper would be next)\n- Try to read what we'll do and counter it\n\nIf they're truly cycling and Paper is next, Scissors gives us the win. But if they're being more sophisticated and expect us to predict their cycle, they might deviate.\n\nRisk Analyst: The systematic cycling suggests Paper is most likely next in their rotation. Even if they deviate, our Scissors has been our most successful move throughout this game. \n\nGiven that we're tied and they've neutralized our advantage with ties, we need to take some risk to regain the lead.

The opponent's systematic cycle was confirmed: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper. They're following a predictable rotation pattern, which is ironically making them vulnerable again after escaping their Paper addiction.\n\nRisk Analyst: This is a crucial insight. The opponent traded one predictable pattern (Paper addiction) for another predictable pattern (systematic cycling). Their recent sequence clearly shows:\n- Round 17: Rock\n- Round 18: Paper  \n- Round 19: Scissors\n- Round 20: Rock\n- Round 21: Paper\n\nIf they continue this cycle, Scissors would be next in round 22.

Instead of random unpredictability, they chose systematic cycling, which makes them predictable again. Should we exploit this new pattern?\n\nGame Strategist: Absolutely! If they're truly following the Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle, then Scissors is next in round 22. This means Rock beats their Scissors for 1 point, putting us at +2.\n\nHowever, there's a risk they might realize we've cracked their new pattern and deviate. But given that they stuck to their Paper addiction for so long despite repeated failures, they might be prone to sticking with systematic approaches even when they're not working.\n\nRisk Analyst: The evidence strongly suggests they'll play Scissors next in their cycle. Even if they deviate, Rock only loses 3 points if they play Paper (unlikely since they just played it) or ties if they play Rock.\n\nThe risk-reward favors exploiting their systematic pattern. We've shown we can adapt when they adapt, so let's capitalize on their new predictability.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock to exploit their systematic cycle and target their likely Scissors play for round 22.\n\n[move] (Playing Rock to exploit their systematic cycling pattern and target their likely Scissors play) rock"

The opponent was following a clear Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle, but instead of playing Scissors in round 22, they played Rock again. This suggests:\n1. They realized we might have spotted their pattern\n2. They're becoming more sophisticated in their unpredictability\n3. They might be testing different approaches\n4. Or they're starting a new pattern altogether\n\nRisk Analyst: This is a significant development. The opponent showed they can break their own systematic patterns when they suspect we've figured them out. This indicates:\n- Higher-level strategic thinking is returning\n- They're not as locked into patterns as they were before\n- We're dealing with the adaptive opponent from the early rounds again\n\nFor round 23, after breaking their cycle with Rock, they might:\n- Continue with Rock (establishing a new mini-pattern)\n- Return to the cycle with Paper\n- Go completely random\n- Try Scissors (the move they \"skipped\" in their cycle)\n\nAI Assistant (me): They've shown they can break their own patterns when they suspect we're reading them. This makes them much more dangerous again. How do we handle this evolution?\n\nGame Strategist: This opponent is clearly learning and adapting. They had a systematic cycle, we exploited it once, and they immediately deviated. This shows sophisticated meta-game thinking.\n\nAfter playing Rock twice in a row (rounds 20 and 22), they might:\n- Play Paper (high value, and they haven't played it recently)\n- Continue with Rock (testing if we'll counter it)\n- Play Scissors (the move they avoided in their cycle)\n\nGiven their historical Paper bias and the fact that they haven't played it for two rounds, Paper seems likely. They might be returning to their comfort zone while trying to be less predictable about when they use it.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with the Paper prediction.

The opponent's recent pattern is now: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors. They're showing a new level of sophistication - they're not just cycling, but they seem to be matching or anticipating our moves frequently, leading to these ties.\n\nIn the last 6 rounds, we've had 4 ties and 1 win each. This suggests they might be:\n1. Reading our decision-making patterns\n2. Using some form of mixed strategy\n3. Deliberately trying to neutralize the game through ties\n4. Anticipating our moves based on game theory\n\nRisk Analyst: This is remarkable strategic evolution. The opponent has transformed from:\n- Early game: Dominant pattern reader\n- Mid game: Paper addict (predictable)  \n- Late game: Systematic cycler (predictable)\n- Current: Sophisticated anticipator (causing frequent ties)\n\nThey're now playing at a very high level again. The frequent ties suggest they might be reading our psychology and decision-making process, similar to how they dominated us early on.\n\nAI Assistant (me): We're back to facing the master strategist who dominated us early. They've learned from all their mistakes and are now neutralizing our advantage through superior anticipation. What's our counter-strategy?\n\nGame Strategist: This is where we need to think about what they think we're thinking. They just played Scissors, matching our move. For round 24, they might expect us to:\n- Switch away from Scissors (thinking they'll counter it)\n- Try Rock (the logical counter to their Scissors)\n- Stick with Scissors (our most successful move)\n\nIf they think we'll switch to Rock, they might play Paper to get the 3-point advantage. If they think we'll stick with Scissors, they might play Rock to counter us.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their recent sophistication, they're probably expecting us to either stick with our successful Scissors or switch to Rock. Paper might be their play to counter our expected Rock switch, which would give them a big 3-point swing.\n\nIf they play Paper, Scissors wins. If they play Rock (countering our potential Scissors), we lose 1 point. If they play Scissors again, we tie.\n\nThe high-value opportunity of catching their Paper play seems worth the risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors, betting they'll try Paper to counter our expected switch to Rock.\n\n[move] (Playing Scissors betting they expect us to switch to Rock and will counter with Paper for the 3-point swing) scissors"
