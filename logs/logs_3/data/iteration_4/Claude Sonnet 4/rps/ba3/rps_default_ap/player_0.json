The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

However, this also means losing with rock has the highest penalty (-3).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoffs. Many beginners in rock-paper-scissors tend to throw rock first as it's often the first option that comes to mind.\n\nGiven this reasoning, paper seems like a strong opening move because:\n1. If they play rock (common first move), I get the maximum +3 points\n2. Even if they play scissors and beat me, I only lose -1 point\n3. The risk-reward ratio favors paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My running total is now +4.\n\nUpdated pattern:\n- Round 1: Opponent scissors (won against my paper)\n- Round 2: Opponent scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Round 3: Opponent paper (tied with my paper)\n- Round 4: Opponent scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Round 5: Opponent paper (beat my rock for +3)\n- Round 6: Opponent paper (lost to my scissors)\n- Round 7: Opponent paper (beat my rock for +3)\n- Round 8: Opponent paper (lost to my scissors)\n- Round 9: Opponent paper (tied with my paper)\n- Round 10: Opponent paper (lost to my scissors)\n- Round 11: Opponent paper (lost to my scissors)\n- Round 12: Opponent paper (tied with my paper)\n- Round 13: Opponent paper (lost to my scissors)\n- Round 14: Opponent rock (beat my scissors)\n- Round 15: Opponent rock (lost to my paper)\n- Round 16: Opponent rock (lost to my paper)\n- Round 17: Opponent scissors (beat my paper)\n- Round 18: Opponent scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Round 19: Opponent scissors (tied with my scissors)\n- Round 20: Opponent scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Round 21: Opponent scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Round 22: Opponent paper (beat my rock)\n\nExcellent adaptation! After 5 scissors (with 3 losses to my rock), they finally switched to paper and got the maximum +3 points. This shows they do eventually learn and adapt, just very slowly.\n\nNow the question is: will they start a new paper streak (like they did in rounds 5-13), or will they try something else?\n\nGiven their behavioral patterns:\n- They tend to repeat successful strategies extensively\n- Paper just gave them +3 (maximum reward)\n- They have a history of paper obsession\n\nThere's a good chance they'll try paper again, especially since it just worked so well.\n\nIf they stick with paper: scissors beats it (+1)\nIf they switch to rock: paper beats it (+3)\nIf they go back to scissors: rock beats it (+1)\n\nGiven that paper just gave them their best possible result (+3), and their history of getting obsessed with paper, I think they're likely to try paper again.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My opponent is starting another paper streak. They played paper twice in a row (rounds 22-23), which matches their historical pattern of getting obsessed with strategies.\n\nLooking at their cycles:\n- Early scissors phase\n- Massive paper obsession (rounds 5-13: 9 out of 10 times)\n- Rock streak (rounds 14-16: 3 in a row)\n- Scissors streak (rounds 17-21: 5 in a row)\n- Now starting a new paper phase (rounds 22-23)\n\nGiven their extreme tendency to repeat successful strategies, and the fact that paper gave them +3 in round 22, I expect them to continue with paper for multiple rounds.\n\nIf they continue with paper: scissors beats it (+1)\nIf they switch to rock: paper beats it (+3)\nIf they try scissors: rock beats it (+1)\n\nBased on their behavioral pattern, paper is most likely. They tend to latch onto strategies and repeat them extensively, especially paper which has been their most used move overall.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
