    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice that paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have a developed strategy yet. New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned and feels most \"solid\" or \"strong.\"\n\n4. If the opponent chooses rock (which is statistically common for new players), then paper would give me the maximum +3 points.\n\n5. Even if they don't choose rock, the worst case with paper is:\n   - Lose to scissors: -1 point\n   - Tie with paper: 0 points\n   - Beat rock: +3 points\n\n6. The expected value seems favorable for paper, especially against a new player who might gravitate toward rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

This tells me the opponent also chose paper, which suggests they might have similar reasoning to mine - recognizing that paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins.\n\n3. Now I need to predict what they'll do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it has the highest potential reward\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll stick with paper and try to counter with scissors\n   - They might think I'll try to counter their paper with scissors, so they'll switch to rock\n\n4. Analyzing the meta-game:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock (expecting me to play paper again): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors (expecting me to play paper again): I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n5. Since they showed strategic thinking by choosing paper in round 1, they're likely thinking about counters. The most logical counter to paper is scissors.\n\n6. If I expect them to play scissors (to counter my previous paper), then I should play rock to beat their scissors.\n\n7.

The opponent has demonstrated excellent pattern recognition and adaptation. They:\n   - Recognized I was stuck in a scissors loop\n   - Used scissors defensively for two rounds to avoid losses\n   - Then exploited my predictability with rock\n\n5. Current situation analysis:\n   - I'm back to 0 points total\n   - The opponent has successfully counter-predicted me multiple times\n   - I need to break my own predictable patterns\n\n6. Opponent's recent moves: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   They just successfully used rock to beat my scissors. They might:\n   - Expect me to switch away from scissors now\n   - Think I'll play paper to counter an expected rock repeat\n   - Anticipate that I'll try rock myself to beat expected scissors\n\n7. The opponent has shown they favor paper historically (5 times total) and just demonstrated they can use rock strategically. If they expect me to play paper (countering expected rock), they might play scissors.\n\n8. But they might also expect me to overthink this and return to paper (my historically successful move), in which case they'd play scissors to counter.\n\n9. Given their strategic sophistication, I should expect scissors and play rock.\n\n[move] Rock"

Round history so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Total score: 0 points\n\n2. Opponent's move sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n\n3. Pattern observation: The opponent just played rock twice in a row (rounds 9 and 10), similar to how they played scissors twice in a row (rounds 7 and 8).\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Paper: 4 times (rounds 1, 3, 5)\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 4, 6, 9, 10)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 2, 7, 8)\n\n5. The opponent's strategy evolution:\n   - Early game: Heavy paper preference\n   - Mid game: Strategic rock usage\n   - Recent: Clustering similar moves (scissors-scissors, then rock-rock)\n\n6. Key insight: The opponent seems to be following a pattern of playing moves in clusters and then switching. They might:\n   - Continue with rock (making it three in a row)\n   - Switch to a different move, expecting me to counter rock\n   - Return to their historically strong paper\n\n7. Given that rock just tied, they might think:\n   - I'll stick with rock, so they should play paper (+3 points)\n   - I'll switch to paper (to counter expected rock), so they should play scissors\n   - I'll be unpredictable, so they should be unpredictable too\n\n8. The opponent has shown strong strategic thinking. If they expect me to play paper (either to counter rock or because paper has been my most successful move historically), they would play scissors.\n\n9. However, they might also think I'll expect scissors and play rock instead. But their preference for high-value moves (paper gives +3) might draw them back to paper.\n\n10. Given the tie situation and their historical paper preference, I'll predict paper and counter with scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Round history so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Total score: 0 points\n\n2.

Pattern analysis - Recent clustering:\n   - Scissors-Scissors (rounds 7-8)\n   - Rock-Rock (rounds 9-10)\n   - Now Scissors again (round 11)\n\n4. The opponent's behavior shows they're matching my moves frequently now:\n   - 5 ties out of 11 rounds (45% tie rate)\n   - They seem to be predicting my moves accurately or we're thinking very similarly\n\n5. Critical insight: We've had 3 ties in the last 5 rounds. This suggests either:\n   - We're both becoming predictable in similar ways\n   - The opponent is deliberately choosing defensive ties to avoid losses\n   - There's a convergence in our strategic thinking\n\n6. Updated frequency count:\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Rock: 4 times  \n   - Scissors: 4 times\n   - The opponent has now used all moves equally!\n\n7. For round 12, considering the opponent just played scissors:\n   - They might expect me to play rock (to beat their scissors)\n   - If they expect rock from me, they'd play paper for +3 points\n   - Alternatively, they might think I'll expect paper and play scissors to counter\n\n8. The key question: Are they being defensive (avoiding losses) or offensive (seeking wins)?\n   - Recent ties suggest defensive play\n   - But the +3 reward for paper beating rock is very tempting\n\n9. Given their equal usage of all moves and the high reward potential, I predict they'll go for paper (expecting me to play rock to counter their scissors).\n\n10. If they play paper, I should play scissors to win +1 point.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Opponent's move sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\n3. Critical pattern recognition: The opponent has now beaten my scissors with rock THREE times (rounds 6, 9, and 12). This is not coincidence - they've identified that I play scissors frequently and are exploiting it with rock.\n\n4. My move frequency analysis:\n   - Scissors: 7 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12) - I'm heavily biased toward scissors!\n   - Rock: 3 times (rounds 2, 5, 10)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 1, 4)\n\n5. The opponent has clearly identified my scissors bias and is punishing it systematically with rock. Their recent pattern shows:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock (rounds 11-12, following rounds 9-10 pattern)\n\n6. I need to break my scissors addiction immediately. The opponent expects scissors from me and will likely continue with rock.\n\n7. If they play rock again (expecting my scissors), I should play paper to get +3 points and break their successful counter-strategy.\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play rock: Paper wins +3 points\n   - If they play scissors: Paper loses -1 point  \n   - If they play paper: Tie, 0 points\n\n9. Given their successful rock strategy against my scissors, and my need to break the pattern decisively, paper is the optimal choice.\n\n10. This also returns me to my historically most successful move (paper won me +3 in round 4).\n\n[move] Paper"

Excellent! I correctly predicted their rock and won big with paper. This validates my analysis that they were exploiting my scissors bias.\n\n3.

Updated opponent frequency:\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Rock: 6 times (now their most frequent move)\n   - Scissors: 4 times\n\n5. The opponent just played rock three times in their last four moves (rounds 10, 12, 13). They've clearly identified rock as an effective strategy against my previous scissors-heavy play.\n\n6. Now for round 14, they might think:\n   - I'll repeat paper since it just won big (+3 points)\n   - They should counter with scissors to beat expected paper\n   - Or they might think I'll expect them to play scissors and continue with rock\n\n7. Key psychological factor: They just lost -3 points, which might make them more aggressive or more cautious. Given their recent rock success, they might stick with what's been working.\n\n8. However, if they expect me to repeat paper (greedy for another +3), the logical counter is scissors.\n\n9. My decision tree:\n   - If they play scissors (countering expected paper): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock (continuing their recent pattern): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper: Tie with paper (0 points)\n\n10.

Key pattern identified: The opponent has been alternating between rock and scissors in recent rounds:\n   - Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock (rounds 10-13)\n   - Now Scissors (round 14)\n\n5. Updated opponent frequency:\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Rock: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n\n6. Important strategic insight: I've broken my scissors addiction and started winning by diversifying my moves. The opponent seems to be responding reactively rather than proactively.\n\n7. For round 15, after playing scissors in round 14 and losing, they might:\n   - Switch back to rock (their most successful move recently)\n   - Try paper (seeking the +3 bonus, thinking I might play rock again)\n   - Stick with scissors if they think I'll switch away from rock\n\n8. The opponent just lost to my rock, so they might avoid scissors. Between rock and paper:\n   - If they play rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n9. Given their recent rock frequency and the fact that rock has been their most successful strategy, I predict they'll return to rock.\n\n10.

Ouch! The opponent just successfully counter-predicted me again, using paper to beat my rock for a painful -3 points.\n\n3.

Important pattern shift: After playing rock 4 out of 5 times (rounds 11-15), the opponent just switched to paper! This shows they can adapt when their strategy isn't working.\n\n5.

Key insight: The opponent is learning and adapting. They're not stuck in patterns - they can break them strategically when being exploited.\n\n8. For round 17, after their successful paper play:\n   - They might stick with paper since it just worked (+3 points for them)\n   - They might expect me to counter with scissors and play rock\n   - They might think I'll be frustrated and make an emotional choice\n\n9. Given that they just won big with paper, they might be tempted to repeat it, especially since paper gives the highest reward when it wins.\n\n10. If they repeat paper, I should play scissors to counter it and get +1 point. The risk is manageable since scissors vs rock only loses -1 point.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Another tie! We've now had 6 ties out of 17 rounds (35% tie rate), which is quite high for a random game.\n\n3. Opponent's move sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n4. Updated opponent frequency:\n   - Paper: 5 times\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 6 times (now more balanced)\n\n5. Recent pattern analysis (last 5 moves): Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - They're becoming less predictable and more varied\n   - They successfully broke their rock pattern with paper in round 16\n   - They just played scissors (possibly defensively to avoid another big loss)\n\n6. Strategic observation: After winning big with paper (+3) in round 16, they switched to scissors in round 17. This could indicate:\n   - Defensive play to avoid the -3 penalty if I countered with scissors\n   - They predicted I would play scissors (which I did)\n   - They're trying to be less predictable\n\n7. For round 18, after the tie with scissors:\n   - They might expect me to switch away from scissors\n   - They might think I'll play rock (to beat expected scissors repeat)\n   - They could return to their historically successful moves (rock or paper)\n\n8. Key insight: The opponent has shown they can make big strategic shifts (like the rock \u2192 paper switch in round 16). They're not easily trapped in patterns.\n\n9. Given their recent unpredictability and the fact that they just tied with scissors, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (their most frequent move historically)\n   - Try paper again (for the +3 reward potential)\n   - Expect me to play rock and counter with paper\n\n10. I think they'll expect me to play rock (to beat their expected scissors) and counter with paper for the +3 bonus.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Critical pattern recognition: The opponent has now played rock EIGHT times total, and just returned to rock after the scissors tie. This suggests rock is their default/comfort move.\n\n4. Updated opponent frequency:\n   - Paper: 5 times\n   - Rock: 8 times (clearly dominant)\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n\n5. Key insight: Despite my expectation that they'd play paper for the +3 bonus, they returned to rock. This shows:\n   - Rock is their most trusted strategy\n   - They may be playing more conservatively after recent volatility\n   - They correctly predicted I'd stick with scissors and punished it\n\n6. Recent opponent pattern (last 6 moves): Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - Even with variations, they keep returning to rock\n   - Rock has been their go-to counter for scissors throughout the game\n\n7. My current situation:\n   - I'm at +2 points (still positive but declining)\n   - I need to avoid falling into predictable patterns\n   - The opponent seems to default to rock when uncertain\n\n8. For round 19, after their successful rock play:\n   - They might stick with rock (their most successful move)\n   - They might expect me to counter with paper and play scissors\n   - They might think I'll diversify and be unpredictable\n\n9. Historical analysis: When the opponent plays rock and wins, they tend to either:\n   - Repeat rock (happened multiple times)\n   - Switch strategically if they expect me to counter\n\n10. Given their strong rock bias (8/18 rounds = 44%) and the fact that rock just worked, I should expect rock and play paper for the +3 bonus. This is also my highest-reward option.\n\n[move] Paper"

Excellent prediction! The opponent played rock for the 9th time, confirming their strong bias toward this move. My analysis of their rock preference was correct.\n\n4. Updated opponent frequency after 19 rounds:\n   - Paper: 5 times (26%)\n   - Rock: 9 times (47%) - nearly half their moves!\n   - Scissors: 5 times (26%)\n\n5. Recent pattern confirmation: Rock \u2192 Rock (rounds 18-19)\n   - They're showing a tendency to cluster rock moves\n   - This is now their second consecutive rock play\n\n6. Strategic success analysis: I've won +3 points in 4 different rounds (4, 13, 15, 19) - all by playing paper against their rock. This paper-beats-rock strategy has been my most profitable.\n\n7. For round 20, after their second consecutive rock and another painful -3 loss:\n   - They might finally abandon rock strategy\n   - They might expect me to repeat paper (since it just won big) and counter with scissors\n   - They could be frustrated and try something completely different\n\n8. Psychological factor: They just took their fourth -3 point loss in the game. This level of punishment might force a strategic shift.\n\n9. Counter-prediction analysis:\n   - If they expect me to repeat paper (greedy for another +3), they'd play scissors\n   - If they think I'll diversify, they might return to rock or try paper themselves\n   - If they're being defensive, they might avoid moves that create big point swings\n\n10. Given their pattern of taking big losses and then switching strategies (like in round 16 when they switched from rock-heavy to paper), I expect them to counter my expected paper repeat with scissors.\n\n11. If they play scissors to counter expected paper, I should play rock to win +1 point.\n\n[move] Rock"

I've now won 4 rounds in a row (rounds 13, 15, 19, 20) by successfully predicting their moves. My strategic analysis has become very effective.\n\n6.

Recent opponent pattern (last 4 moves): Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They're becoming more varied and less predictable\n   - They successfully broke away from their rock bias when it wasn't working\n\n8.

The opponent just returned to rock again! This confirms that rock is truly their default strategy when uncertain or after losses.\n\n4. Updated opponent frequency after 21 rounds:\n   - Paper: 5 times (24%)\n   - Rock: 10 times (48%) - nearly half their moves!\n   - Scissors: 6 times (29%)\n\n5. Critical insight: Even after I successfully predicted their counter-strategies for 4 rounds, they reverted to their fundamental rock bias. This suggests rock is their core comfort move.\n\n6. Pattern analysis of opponent's rock usage:\n   - They play rock especially after taking losses\n   - Rock appears in clusters throughout the game\n   - They've now played rock 10 out of 21 rounds\n\n7. My win streak was broken because I over-predicted their counter-prediction. I expected them to play paper (countering expected rock), but they simply returned to their reliable rock strategy.\n\n8. For round 22, they just won with rock (+1 point for them). Based on their patterns:\n   - They might stick with rock since it just worked\n   - They might expect me to counter with paper and switch to scissors\n   - They could continue their rock-heavy approach\n\n9. Historical pattern: When rock succeeds for them, they often repeat it or cluster rock moves together.\n\n10. Given their 48% rock usage rate and the fact that rock just succeeded, the highest probability is that they'll play rock again.\n\n11. If they play rock, I should play paper for +3 points.

Updated opponent frequency after 22 rounds:\n   - Paper: 5 times (23%)\n   - Rock: 10 times (45%)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (32%)\n\n5. Strategic analysis: The opponent has shown they can break out of patterns when being exploited. Just when I thought I had their rock bias figured out, they switched to scissors at the perfect moment.\n\n6. Recent pattern (last 5 moves): Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They're alternating between rock and scissors more frequently\n   - They're becoming less predictable and more reactive to my strategies\n\n7. Key insight: I've been caught in a cycle of over-thinking their counter-predictions. In rounds 21-22, I predicted their counters but they made simpler, more direct strategic choices.\n\n8. For round 23, after their successful scissors play:\n   - They might expect me to counter scissors with rock\n   - They might stick with scissors if they think I'll repeat paper\n   - They could return to rock (their most frequent move)\n\n9.

Key strategic insight: The opponent is now actively counter-predicting my moves rather than just following patterns. This makes the game more complex but also more predictable if I can think two steps ahead.\n\n8. For round 24, after playing paper and losing -1 point:\n   - They might switch away from paper (which just failed)\n   - They might expect me to repeat scissors (since it just won) and counter with rock\n   - They could try to be unpredictable or return to their rock bias\n\n9.
