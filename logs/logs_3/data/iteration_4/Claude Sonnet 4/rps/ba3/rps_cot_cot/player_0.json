    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper beating rock gives significantly more points (+3/-3) compared to the other winning combinations (+1/-1). This creates an asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric payoffs yet. Fresh players often default to rock as it's psychologically associated with strength/power.\n\n4. Formulate initial strategy: Given that:\n   - Fresh players tend to play rock frequently\n   - Paper beats rock with the highest payoff (+3 points)\n   - The risk/reward is favorable for playing paper against a rock-heavy opponent\n\n5. Make the optimal opening move: Paper maximizes my expected value against a fresh player who is likely to play rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze the previous round:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This suggests the opponent either had similar reasoning about the high payoff of paper, or made a lucky guess\n\n2. Consider opponent adaptation:\n   - The opponent chose paper in round 1, showing they may understand the payoff structure\n   - They might continue with paper thinking it's the \"best\" move due to its high reward\n   - Or they might switch, expecting me to play paper again\n\n3. Evaluate my options against a paper-playing opponent:\n   - If opponent plays paper again: scissors beats paper (+1 point for me)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: paper beats rock (+3 points for me)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors: rock beats scissors (+1 point for me)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors: Wins against paper (+1), loses badly against rock (-3), ties against scissors (0)\n   - Playing paper: Wins big against rock (+3), loses against scissors (-1), ties against paper (0)\n   - Playing rock: Wins against scissors (+1), loses badly against paper (-3), ties against rock (0)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Since the opponent showed they can think strategically (choosing paper), they might stick with it or try to counter-predict\n   - Scissors gives me the direct counter to paper with reasonable upside and manageable downside\n\n[move] Scissors"

Identify the opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - Round 1: They chose paper (possibly for the high payoff against rock)\n   - Round 2: They chose scissors (likely to counter the paper they expected me to repeat)\n   - This suggests they're thinking one step ahead and adapting\n\n3.

Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent plays rock (expecting me to play rock): paper beats rock (+3 points)\n   - If opponent plays paper (cycling back): scissors beats paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent appears to be playing adaptively, not randomly\n   - Given they went paper \u2192 scissors, they might expect me to go rock next\n   - Playing paper gives me the highest potential payoff (+3) if they choose rock\n   - Even if they don't choose rock, paper only loses badly to scissors (-1), which seems less likely given they just played it\n\n[move] Paper"

Strategic decision:\n   - Since we've both avoided rock (likely due to its vulnerability to paper's high payoff), the opponent might not expect it\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 point) if they follow the expected pattern\n   - Rock loses badly to paper (-3 points), but paper seems less likely given we just both played it\n   - Time to break the pattern with the \"forgotten\" move\n\n[move] Rock"
