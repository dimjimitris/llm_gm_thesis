    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to analyze this rock-paper-scissors variant and develop a strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Key observation: Paper beating rock gives much higher rewards (3 points) compared to the other winning combinations (1 point each). This creates an asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n3. Strategy consideration: Since paper gives the highest reward when it wins, opponents might be tempted to play paper more often. However, they might also anticipate that others will think this way.\n\n4. Against a \"fresh player\" (someone new/inexperienced), they might:\n   - Play randomly without considering the payoff differences\n   - Be drawn to rock as it's often the default/first choice people make\n   - Not immediately recognize the strategic importance of the asymmetric payoffs\n\n5. Given that paper beats rock and gives the highest reward, and fresh players often default to rock, paper seems like a strong opening move.\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors (giving -1), while if I'm right about rock, I get +3.\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Steps:\n\n1. Analyze the previous round: Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie. This suggests the other player might also recognize the high value of paper (3 points when it beats rock).\n\n2. Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They're not completely random since they also chose the highest-value move\n   - They might be thinking strategically about the payoff matrix\n   - They could continue with paper, or they might switch knowing I might expect paper again\n\n3. Strategic options for this round:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll play paper again): They get +3 if I play paper, so I should avoid paper\n   - If they play scissors (countering expected paper): Rock would beat scissors (+1 point)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors: Wins vs paper (+1), loses vs rock (-1), ties vs scissors (0)\n   - Playing rock: Wins vs scissors (+1), loses vs paper (-3), ties vs rock (0)\n   - Playing paper: Wins vs rock (+3), loses vs scissors (-1), ties vs paper (0)\n\n5. Since they just played paper and might expect me to counter with scissors, they could switch to rock. But the high penalty for losing to paper (-3) makes rock risky for them.\n\n6. I think scissors is the best choice - it beats paper (which they just played) and only has moderate risk.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both played scissors (tie)\n   - My opponent seems to be following a similar strategic thought process as me\n\n2. Look for patterns in the sequence:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors suggests my opponent might be cycling through moves or responding to the same strategic logic I'm using\n   - They might be thinking: \"paper was tied, so try scissors to counter expected paper\"\n\n3. Predict their next move:\n   - If they're cycling: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock would be next\n   - If they're counter-thinking: they might expect me to play rock (to beat their scissors), so they could play paper to beat my expected rock\n   - If they're being more random now after two ties, any move is possible\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)  \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n5. Risk analysis:\n   - If they play rock: Paper gives me +3 (best outcome)\n   - If they play paper: Scissors gives me +1\n   - If they play scissors: Rock gives me +1\n\n6. Given the high reward potential of paper beating rock (+3) and the fact that rock would be a logical next move in a cycling pattern, I'll go with paper.

Key insight: We're thinking too similarly! My opponent is likely using very similar strategic reasoning to mine. This creates a mirroring effect where we keep making the same moves.\n\n3. Consider what they might be thinking now:\n   - They see the same pattern I do: paper, scissors, paper\n   - They might expect me to play scissors next (to counter their expected paper)\n   - Or they might think I'll try to break the pattern entirely\n\n4. Breaking the mirroring strategy:\n   - Since we've been thinking alike, I need to think one level deeper\n   - They might expect scissors (to beat paper), so they could play rock\n   - But if they think I'll think that, they might play paper to beat my rock\n   - This could lead to infinite recursion of thinking\n\n5. Statistical approach:\n   - We've had 3 ties, scoring 0 points total\n   - I need to start winning to maximize points\n   - The opponent has shown they favor paper (appeared twice) over scissors (once)\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   - If they continue favoring paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll play paper again): I lose (-1)\n   - If they play scissors: We tie (0)\n\n7. Since paper has appeared most frequently in their play, and they just played it, I'll counter with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"
