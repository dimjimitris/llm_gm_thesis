    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper vs rock has the highest reward/penalty (3 points)\n   - Rock vs scissors and scissors vs paper have lower rewards (1 point)\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy:\n   - Paper gives the highest potential reward (+3) but also highest risk (-3)\n   - Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they may not recognize the asymmetric payoffs\n   - Fresh players often choose rock as their default/instinctive choice\n   - If they choose rock, paper gives me +3 points\n\n4. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - If opponent plays rock: paper wins +3\n   - If opponent plays scissors: paper loses -1\n   - If opponent plays paper: tie, 0 points\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Against a fresh player, rock is statistically the most common first choice\n   - The high reward for paper beating rock (+3) outweighs the moderate risk\n   - This maximizes my expected value given the opponent type\n\n[move] paper"

Consider opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They chose paper, possibly for the same reason I did (high reward potential)\n   - They might continue with paper thinking it's the optimal choice\n   - Or they might switch, expecting me to stick with paper\n\n3.

Meta-game analysis:\n   - Since we both played paper last round, the opponent might expect me to switch\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter my potential paper play\n   - If they think I'll switch to scissors (to beat their expected paper), they might play rock\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) but loses to rock (-1)\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) but loses to paper (-3)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) but loses to scissors (-1)\n\n6.

Identify opponent's current pattern:\n   - They've now played scissors FOUR times in a row (rounds 6, 7, 8, 9)\n   - This is no longer a temporary deviation - it's a committed strategy\n   - They seem locked into scissors for some reason\n\n3. Consider why they're stuck on scissors:\n   - They might be hoping I'll eventually play paper\n   - They could be testing my patience with ties\n   - They might have developed a fixation after the cycle broke\n   - Or they're deliberately trying a \"pure scissors\" strategy\n\n4. Evaluate continuing with rock:\n   - Rock has beaten scissors in rounds 6 and 9 when I played it\n   - If they continue with scissors, rock gives me another +1 point\n   - This would put me at +1 total score for the first time\n\n5. Consider if they might finally switch:\n   - After losing to my rock, they might realize scissors isn't working\n   - They could switch to paper (which beats rock) for revenge\n   - But their commitment to scissors has been very strong\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock vs scissors: +1 point (likely scenario)\n   - Rock vs paper: -3 points (worst case)\n   - Rock vs rock: 0 points (neutral)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Their scissors pattern is extremely strong (4 consecutive plays)\n   - Even if they're thinking of switching, patterns this strong often continue\n   - The potential +1 point would give me my first positive score\n   - Rock has been successful against their scissors obsession\n   - I should capitalize on their apparent fixation\n\n[move] rock"

Identify the new mirroring pattern:\n   - After I beat them with rock vs their scissors in round 9\n   - They've now matched my moves exactly for 2 consecutive rounds\n   - This could be a deliberate mirroring strategy\n\n3. Consider why they're mirroring:\n   - They might be trying to avoid losses by forcing ties\n   - They could be waiting for me to make the first move in a new direction\n   - They might think I'll get frustrated with ties and make a predictable switch\n   - Or they're buying time to figure out a new counter-strategy\n\n4. Analyze the psychology of mirroring:\n   - Mirroring guarantees no losses but also no wins\n   - They might expect me to eventually try to \"break\" the tie pattern\n   - If I switch and they predict correctly, they could win\n\n5. Evaluate my options against continued mirroring:\n   - If they continue mirroring: any move results in a tie (0 points)\n   - If they try to counter-predict my next move, I need to think one step ahead\n   - If they expect me to switch from scissors, they might play rock (to beat my expected paper)\n\n6. Consider anti-mirroring strategies:\n   - If they're truly mirroring, I could stick with any move indefinitely for ties\n   - But if they're fake-mirroring to set up a counter, I need to be careful\n   - They might expect me to play paper next (to try something different from rock/scissors)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they're genuinely mirroring, paper gives me a tie\n   - If they're expecting me to play paper and counter with scissors, paper loses -1\n   - If they're expecting me to stick with scissors and play rock, scissors loses -1\n   - Rock might be unexpected since I just played it two rounds ago\n   - Rock also protects against scissors if they try to counter-predict\n\n[move] rock"

Identify what just happened:\n   - They abandoned the mirroring strategy after just 2 rounds\n   - They returned to scissors, which I've seen them favor heavily\n   - This suggests scissors might be their \"default\" or comfort move\n\n3. Analyze their scissors tendency:\n   - Looking back: they played scissors in rounds 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12\n   - That's 6 out of the last 7 rounds they've played scissors\n   - Even when they tried mirroring, they quickly returned to scissors\n\n4.

Analyze the recent game history:\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1)\n   - Current score: -2 points\n\n2. Identify their recent pattern shift:\n   - They broke their Paper/Rock alternation in round 17\n   - They've now played scissors twice in a row (rounds 17 and 18)\n   - This suggests they might be returning to their earlier scissors fixation\n\n3. Recall their historical scissors tendency:\n   - Earlier in the game, they played scissors heavily for many consecutive rounds\n   - When uncertain or changing strategies, they seem to default back to scissors\n   - This could be their comfort/default move\n\n4. Consider their current strategic state:\n   - Their successful Paper/Rock alternation was broken when I adapted\n   - They might be reverting to scissors while figuring out a new strategy\n   - Two scissors in a row suggests this could continue\n\n5. Evaluate the momentum:\n   - I've been gaining ground: won +3, tied 0, won +1 in last 3 rounds\n   - I'm climbing back from my -6 point low\n   - Continuing to exploit their potential scissors pattern could get me to positive territory\n\n6. Assess the risk/reward:\n   - If they continue with scissors: rock beats scissors (+1, total: -1)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock loses to paper (-3, total: -5)\n   - If they switch to rock: tie (0, total: -2)\n\n7. Consider their psychology:\n   - After losing to my rock vs their scissors, they might adapt\n   - But their scissors tendency has been historically very strong\n   - They might need a few rounds to develop a new counter-strategy\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Their return to scissors (2 consecutive) suggests their old pattern is reasserting\n   - Rock has been very effective against their scissors preference\n   - The potential to get to -1 total (almost breakeven) is worth the risk\n   - Their scissors fixation historically lasted for many rounds\n\n[move] rock"

Recognize their adaptive counter-strategy:\n   - After playing scissors twice (rounds 17-18), they switched to paper\n   - They likely predicted I would continue with rock after it beat their scissors\n   - This shows they're still thinking ahead and countering my patterns\n\n3. Identify their current approach:\n   - They're not sticking to any single pattern for too long\n   - They adapt when they see I'm exploiting a pattern\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper shows varied play\n\n4. Consider what they might expect now:\n   - After hitting me with paper vs rock (-3 points), they might expect me to switch\n   - They could anticipate scissors (to counter potential continued paper)\n   - Or they might expect paper (if I think they'll return to rock)\n\n5. Analyze their recent sequence:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - If they're trying a new pattern, next could be Rock (completing a cycle)\n   - Or they might stick with paper if they think I'll avoid rock\n\n6. Evaluate my desperate situation:\n   - Back down to -5 points after making progress\n   - I need to avoid falling into predictable patterns\n   - I also need to take some calculated risks to recover\n\n7. Consider the psychological moment:\n   - They just successfully punished my predictable rock play\n   - They might expect me to be rattled and play defensively\n   - Or they might think I'll try to counter their paper with scissors\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - If they stick with paper: scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock: paper beats rock (+3, desperately needed)\n   - If they play scissors: scissors ties (0)\n   - Scissors covers the most likely scenario (continued paper) and has reasonable outcomes for other possibilities\n   - I need to start being less predictable while still trying to gain points\n\n[move] scissors"

Identify their counter-prediction pattern:\n   - After scissors vs scissors tie, they continued scissors\n   - After losing scissors to my rock, they played paper (beats rock)\n   - After beating my rock with paper, they played rock (beats scissors)\n   - They're staying one step ahead by predicting my logical responses\n\n3. Recognize their strategic sophistication:\n   - They're not following a simple pattern anymore\n   - They're actively counter-predicting my moves based on game flow\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock suggests they might be cycling through counters\n\n4. Consider what they might predict next:\n   - After losing scissors to their rock, they might expect me to play paper (beats rock)\n   - If they expect paper, they would play scissors to counter it\n   - Alternatively, they might continue their apparent Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle\n\n5. Analyze their recent moves for patterns:\n   - Last 3 moves: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - If cycling, next might be Scissors\n   - This would complete a defensive cycle covering all my potential responses\n\n6. Evaluate my critical situation:\n   - At -6 points, I need significant wins to recover\n   - I can't afford to keep being predictable\n   - I need to either break their prediction pattern or find their cycle\n\n7. Consider the meta-game psychology:\n   - They've been incredibly successful at staying ahead of me\n   - They might expect me to try paper (logical counter to their rock)\n   - But they also might expect me to avoid the obvious choice\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - If they complete Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors cycle: rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they expect my paper and play scissors: rock ties with nothing, loses to paper\n   - Given their recent success with counter-prediction, trying to exploit a potential cycle pattern might be my best chance\n   - Rock also avoids the obvious paper choice they might be expecting\n\n[move] rock"

Consider their strategic reasoning:\n   - The cycle ensures they're always prepared for common responses\n   - It's been mostly effective except when I correctly predicted it\n   - They might stick with it since it's generally working\n\n5.
