Analyze the pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both played scissors (tie)\n   - My opponent seems to be following a similar strategic thought process as me\n\n2. Look for patterns in the sequence:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors suggests my opponent might be cycling through moves or responding to the same strategic logic I'm using\n   - They might be thinking: \"paper was tied, so try scissors to counter expected paper\"\n\n3. Predict their next move:\n   - If they're cycling: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock would be next\n   - If they're counter-thinking: they might expect me to play rock (to beat their scissors), so they could play paper to beat my expected rock\n   - If they're being more random now after two ties, any move is possible\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)  \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n5. Risk analysis:\n   - If they play rock: Paper gives me +3 (best outcome)\n   - If they play paper: Scissors gives me +1\n   - If they play scissors: Rock gives me +1\n\n6. Given the high reward potential of paper beating rock (+3) and the fact that rock would be a logical next move in a cycling pattern, I'll go with paper. The risk is only -1 if they play scissors.\n\n[move] paper",

Key insight: We're thinking too similarly! My opponent is likely using very similar strategic reasoning to mine. This creates a mirroring effect where we keep making the same moves.\n\n3. Consider what they might be thinking now:\n   - They see the same pattern I do: paper, scissors, paper\n   - They might expect me to play scissors next (to counter their expected paper)\n   - Or they might think I'll try to break the pattern entirely\n\n4. Breaking the mirroring strategy:\n   - Since we've been thinking alike, I need to think one level deeper\n   - They might expect scissors (to beat paper), so they could play rock\n   - But if they think I'll think that, they might play paper to beat my rock\n   - This could lead to infinite recursion of thinking\n\n5. Statistical approach:\n   - We've had 3 ties, scoring 0 points total\n   - I need to start winning to maximize points\n   - The opponent has shown they favor paper (appeared twice) over scissors (once)\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   - If they continue favoring paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll play paper again): I lose (-1)\n   - If they play scissors: We tie (0)\n\n7. Since paper has appeared most frequently in their play, and they just played it, I'll counter with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors",
