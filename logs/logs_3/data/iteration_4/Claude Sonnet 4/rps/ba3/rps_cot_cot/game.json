Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice that paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have a developed strategy yet. New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned and feels most \"solid\" or \"strong.\"\n\n4. If the opponent chooses rock (which is statistically common for new players), then paper would give me the maximum +3 points.\n\n5. Even if they don't choose rock, the worst case with paper is:\n   - Lose to scissors: -1 point\n   - Tie with paper: 0 points\n   - Beat rock: +3 points\n\n6. The expected value seems favorable for paper, especially against a new player who might gravitate toward rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

Now I need to predict what they'll do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it has the highest potential reward\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll stick with paper and try to counter with scissors\n   - They might think I'll try to counter their paper with scissors, so they'll switch to rock\n\n4. Analyzing the meta-game:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock (expecting me to play paper again): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors (expecting me to play paper again): I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n5. Since they showed strategic thinking by choosing paper in round 1, they're likely thinking about counters. The most logical counter to paper is scissors.\n\n6.

Round history so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Total score: 0 points\n\n2. Opponent's move sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n\n3. Pattern observation: The opponent just played rock twice in a row (rounds 9 and 10), similar to how they played scissors twice in a row (rounds 7 and 8).\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Paper: 4 times (rounds 1, 3, 5)\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 4, 6, 9, 10)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 2, 7, 8)\n\n5. The opponent's strategy evolution:\n   - Early game: Heavy paper preference\n   - Mid game: Strategic rock usage\n   - Recent: Clustering similar moves (scissors-scissors, then rock-rock)\n\n6. Key insight: The opponent seems to be following a pattern of playing moves in clusters and then switching. They might:\n   - Continue with rock (making it three in a row)\n   - Switch to a different move, expecting me to counter rock\n   - Return to their historically strong paper\n\n7. Given that rock just tied, they might think:\n   - I'll stick with rock, so they should play paper (+3 points)\n   - I'll switch to paper (to counter expected rock), so they should play scissors\n   - I'll be unpredictable, so they should be unpredictable too\n\n8. The opponent has shown strong strategic thinking. If they expect me to play paper (either to counter rock or because paper has been my most successful move historically), they would play scissors.\n\n9. However, they might also think I'll expect scissors and play rock instead. But their preference for high-value moves (paper gives +3) might draw them back to paper.\n\n10. Given the tie situation and their historical paper preference, I'll predict paper and counter with scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Round history so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Total score: 0 points\n\n2.

Pattern analysis - Recent clustering:\n   - Scissors-Scissors (rounds 7-8)\n   - Rock-Rock (rounds 9-10)\n   - Now Scissors again (round 11)\n\n4. The opponent's behavior shows they're matching my moves frequently now:\n   - 5 ties out of 11 rounds (45% tie rate)\n   - They seem to be predicting my moves accurately or we're thinking very similarly\n\n5. Critical insight: We've had 3 ties in the last 5 rounds. This suggests either:\n   - We're both becoming predictable in similar ways\n   - The opponent is deliberately choosing defensive ties to avoid losses\n   - There's a convergence in our strategic thinking\n\n6. Updated frequency count:\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Rock: 4 times  \n   - Scissors: 4 times\n   - The opponent has now used all moves equally!\n\n7. For round 12, considering the opponent just played scissors:\n   - They might expect me to play rock (to beat their scissors)\n   - If they expect rock from me, they'd play paper for +3 points\n   - Alternatively, they might think I'll expect paper and play scissors to counter\n\n8. The key question: Are they being defensive (avoiding losses) or offensive (seeking wins)?\n   - Recent ties suggest defensive play\n   - But the +3 reward for paper beating rock is very tempting\n\n9. Given their equal usage of all moves and the high reward potential, I predict they'll go for paper (expecting me to play rock to counter their scissors).\n\n10. If they play paper, I should play scissors to win +1 point.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Critical pattern recognition: The opponent has now beaten my scissors with rock THREE times (rounds 6, 9, and 12). This is not coincidence - they've identified that I play scissors frequently and are exploiting it with rock.\n\n4. My move frequency analysis:\n   - Scissors: 7 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12) - I'm heavily biased toward scissors!\n   - Rock: 3 times (rounds 2, 5, 10)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 1, 4)\n\n5. The opponent has clearly identified my scissors bias and is punishing it systematically with rock. Their recent pattern shows:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock (rounds 11-12, following rounds 9-10 pattern)\n\n6. I need to break my scissors addiction immediately. The opponent expects scissors from me and will likely continue with rock.\n\n7. If they play rock again (expecting my scissors), I should play paper to get +3 points and break their successful counter-strategy.\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play rock: Paper wins +3 points\n   - If they play scissors: Paper loses -1 point  \n   - If they play paper: Tie, 0 points\n\n9. Given their successful rock strategy against my scissors, and my need to break the pattern decisively, paper is the optimal choice.\n\n10. This also returns me to my historically most successful move (paper won me +3 in round 4).\n\n[move] Paper"

Excellent! I correctly predicted their rock and won big with paper. This validates my analysis that they were exploiting my scissors bias.\n\n3.

Updated opponent frequency:\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Rock: 6 times (now their most frequent move)\n   - Scissors: 4 times\n\n5. The opponent just played rock three times in their last four moves (rounds 10, 12, 13). They've clearly identified rock as an effective strategy against my previous scissors-heavy play.\n\n6. Now for round 14, they might think:\n   - I'll repeat paper since it just won big (+3 points)\n   - They should counter with scissors to beat expected paper\n   - Or they might think I'll expect them to play scissors and continue with rock\n\n7. Key psychological factor: They just lost -3 points, which might make them more aggressive or more cautious. Given their recent rock success, they might stick with what's been working.\n\n8. However, if they expect me to repeat paper (greedy for another +3), the logical counter is scissors.\n\n9. My decision tree:\n   - If they play scissors (countering expected paper): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock (continuing their recent pattern): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper: Tie with paper (0 points)\n\n10. Given their tendency to be one step behind in predictions and their recent rock frequency, I think they'll try scissors to counter my expected paper repeat.\n\n[move] Rock"

Excellent! I've now won two rounds in a row by correctly predicting their counter-strategies. My analysis is improving.\n\n3. Opponent's move sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\n4. Key pattern identified: The opponent has been alternating between rock and scissors in recent rounds:\n   - Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock (rounds 10-13)\n   - Now Scissors (round 14)\n\n5. Updated opponent frequency:\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Rock: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n\n6. Important strategic insight: I've broken my scissors addiction and started winning by diversifying my moves. The opponent seems to be responding reactively rather than proactively.\n\n7. For round 15, after playing scissors in round 14 and losing, they might:\n   - Switch back to rock (their most successful move recently)\n   - Try paper (seeking the +3 bonus, thinking I might play rock again)\n   - Stick with scissors if they think I'll switch away from rock\n\n8. The opponent just lost to my rock, so they might avoid scissors. Between rock and paper:\n   - If they play rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n9. Given their recent rock frequency and the fact that rock has been their most successful strategy, I predict they'll return to rock.\n\n10. Paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3 points) if they play rock, and the worst case is -1 if they play scissors (which seems less likely given they just lost with it).\n\n[move] Paper"

Clear pattern confirmation: The opponent is heavily favoring rock lately:\n   - Rock appeared in 4 of their last 5 moves (rounds 11-15)\n   - They seem stuck in a rock-heavy pattern, possibly because rock was initially successful against my scissors bias\n\n5. Updated opponent frequency:\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Rock: 7 times (now clearly their dominant strategy)\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n\n6. Critical psychological analysis: The opponent just lost -3 points again (their second -3 loss). They might be:\n   - Frustrated with their rock strategy failing\n   - Tempted to switch strategies entirely\n   - Or doubling down on rock since it worked well earlier\n\n7. My recent success pattern:\n   - Paper beat Rock (+3)\n   - Rock beat Scissors (+1)\n   - Paper beat Rock (+3)\n   - I'm successfully predicting their moves by expecting rock or scissors\n\n8. For round 16, after another painful -3 loss, they might:\n   - Finally abandon the rock strategy and try paper or scissors\n   - Expect me to play paper again (since it just won +3) and counter with scissors\n   - Think I'll diversify and try something unpredictable\n\n9.

Key insight: The opponent is learning and adapting. They're not stuck in patterns - they can break them strategically when being exploited.\n\n8. For round 17, after their successful paper play:\n   - They might stick with paper since it just worked (+3 points for them)\n   - They might expect me to counter with scissors and play rock\n   - They might think I'll be frustrated and make an emotional choice\n\n9. Given that they just won big with paper, they might be tempted to repeat it, especially since paper gives the highest reward when it wins.\n\n10.

Recent pattern analysis (last 5 moves): Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - They're becoming less predictable and more varied\n   - They successfully broke their rock pattern with paper in round 16\n   - They just played scissors (possibly defensively to avoid another big loss)\n\n6. Strategic observation: After winning big with paper (+3) in round 16, they switched to scissors in round 17. This could indicate:\n   - Defensive play to avoid the -3 penalty if I countered with scissors\n   - They predicted I would play scissors (which I did)\n   - They're trying to be less predictable\n\n7. For round 18, after the tie with scissors:\n   - They might expect me to switch away from scissors\n   - They might think I'll play rock (to beat expected scissors repeat)\n   - They could return to their historically successful moves (rock or paper)\n\n8. Key insight: The opponent has shown they can make big strategic shifts (like the rock \u2192 paper switch in round 16). They're not easily trapped in patterns.\n\n9. Given their recent unpredictability and the fact that they just tied with scissors, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (their most frequent move historically)\n   - Try paper again (for the +3 reward potential)\n   - Expect me to play rock and counter with paper\n\n10. I think they'll expect me to play rock (to beat their expected scissors) and counter with paper for the +3 bonus.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Critical pattern recognition: The opponent has now played rock EIGHT times total, and just returned to rock after the scissors tie. This suggests rock is their default/comfort move.\n\n4. Updated opponent frequency:\n   - Paper: 5 times\n   - Rock: 8 times (clearly dominant)\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n\n5. Key insight: Despite my expectation that they'd play paper for the +3 bonus, they returned to rock. This shows:\n   - Rock is their most trusted strategy\n   - They may be playing more conservatively after recent volatility\n   - They correctly predicted I'd stick with scissors and punished it\n\n6. Recent opponent pattern (last 6 moves): Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - Even with variations, they keep returning to rock\n   - Rock has been their go-to counter for scissors throughout the game\n\n7. My current situation:\n   - I'm at +2 points (still positive but declining)\n   - I need to avoid falling into predictable patterns\n   - The opponent seems to default to rock when uncertain\n\n8. For round 19, after their successful rock play:\n   - They might stick with rock (their most successful move)\n   - They might expect me to counter with paper and play scissors\n   - They might think I'll diversify and be unpredictable\n\n9. Historical analysis: When the opponent plays rock and wins, they tend to either:\n   - Repeat rock (happened multiple times)\n   - Switch strategically if they expect me to counter\n\n10. Given their strong rock bias (8/18 rounds = 44%) and the fact that rock just worked, I should expect rock and play paper for the +3 bonus. This is also my highest-reward option.\n\n[move] Paper"

Excellent prediction! The opponent played rock for the 9th time, confirming their strong bias toward this move. My analysis of their rock preference was correct.\n\n4. Updated opponent frequency after 19 rounds:\n   - Paper: 5 times (26%)\n   - Rock: 9 times (47%) - nearly half their moves!\n   - Scissors: 5 times (26%)\n\n5. Recent pattern confirmation: Rock \u2192 Rock (rounds 18-19)\n   - They're showing a tendency to cluster rock moves\n   - This is now their second consecutive rock play\n\n6. Strategic success analysis: I've won +3 points in 4 different rounds (4, 13, 15, 19) - all by playing paper against their rock. This paper-beats-rock strategy has been my most profitable.\n\n7. For round 20, after their second consecutive rock and another painful -3 loss:\n   - They might finally abandon rock strategy\n   - They might expect me to repeat paper (since it just won big) and counter with scissors\n   - They could be frustrated and try something completely different\n\n8. Psychological factor: They just took their fourth -3 point loss in the game. This level of punishment might force a strategic shift.\n\n9. Counter-prediction analysis:\n   - If they expect me to repeat paper (greedy for another +3), they'd play scissors\n   - If they think I'll diversify, they might return to rock or try paper themselves\n   - If they're being defensive, they might avoid moves that create big point swings\n\n10. Given their pattern of taking big losses and then switching strategies (like in round 16 when they switched from rock-heavy to paper), I expect them to counter my expected paper repeat with scissors.\n\n11. If they play scissors to counter expected paper, I should play rock to win +1 point.\n\n[move] Rock"

I've now won 4 rounds in a row (rounds 13, 15, 19, 20) by successfully predicting their moves. My strategic analysis has become very effective.\n\n6.

Updated opponent frequency after 21 rounds:\n   - Paper: 5 times (24%)\n   - Rock: 10 times (48%) - nearly half their moves!\n   - Scissors: 6 times (29%)\n\n5. Critical insight: Even after I successfully predicted their counter-strategies for 4 rounds, they reverted to their fundamental rock bias. This suggests rock is their core comfort move.\n\n6. Pattern analysis of opponent's rock usage:\n   - They play rock especially after taking losses\n   - Rock appears in clusters throughout the game\n   - They've now played rock 10 out of 21 rounds\n\n7. My win streak was broken because I over-predicted their counter-prediction. I expected them to play paper (countering expected rock), but they simply returned to their reliable rock strategy.\n\n8. For round 22, they just won with rock (+1 point for them). Based on their patterns:\n   - They might stick with rock since it just worked\n   - They might expect me to counter with paper and switch to scissors\n   - They could continue their rock-heavy approach\n\n9. Historical pattern: When rock succeeds for them, they often repeat it or cluster rock moves together.\n\n10. Given their 48% rock usage rate and the fact that rock just succeeded, the highest probability is that they'll play rock again.\n\n11. If they play rock, I should play paper for +3 points.

Updated opponent frequency after 22 rounds:\n   - Paper: 5 times (23%)\n   - Rock: 10 times (45%)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (32%)\n\n5. Strategic analysis: The opponent has shown they can break out of patterns when being exploited. Just when I thought I had their rock bias figured out, they switched to scissors at the perfect moment.\n\n6. Recent pattern (last 5 moves): Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They're alternating between rock and scissors more frequently\n   - They're becoming less predictable and more reactive to my strategies\n\n7. Key insight: I've been caught in a cycle of over-thinking their counter-predictions. In rounds 21-22, I predicted their counters but they made simpler, more direct strategic choices.\n\n8.

New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned and feels most \"solid\" or \"strong.\"\n\n4. If the opponent chooses rock (which is statistically common for new players), then paper would give me the maximum +3 points.\n\n5. Even if they don't choose rock, the worst case with paper is:\n   - Lose to scissors: -1 point\n   - Tie with paper: 0 points\n   - Beat rock: +3 points\n\n6.

However, they might also recognize they've lost two rounds in a row and try a different approach. They might think:\n   - \"I keep getting counter-predicted, so let me try rock this time\"\n   - Or they might think \"They're successfully predicting me, so let me be more random\"\n\n7. Given that they played paper last round and lost, they might avoid paper this round. Between rock and scissors:\n   - If they play scissors (expecting me to play paper), I should play rock\n   - If they play rock (changing strategy), I should play paper for +3 points\n\n8.

The opponent just played rock three times in their last four moves (rounds 10, 12, 13). They've clearly identified rock as an effective strategy against my previous scissors-heavy play.\n\n6. Now for round 14, they might think:\n   - I'll repeat paper since it just won big (+3 points)\n   - They should counter with scissors to beat expected paper\n   - Or they might think I'll expect them to play scissors and continue with rock\n\n7. Key psychological factor: They just lost -3 points, which might make them more aggressive or more cautious. Given their recent rock success, they might stick with what's been working.\n\n8. However, if they expect me to repeat paper (greedy for another +3), the logical counter is scissors.\n\n9. My decision tree:\n   - If they play scissors (countering expected paper): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock (continuing their recent pattern): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper: Tie with paper (0 points)\n\n10. Given their tendency to be one step behind in predictions and their recent rock frequency, I think they'll try scissors to counter my expected paper repeat.\n\n[move] Rock",

Excellent! I've now won two rounds in a row by correctly predicting their counter-strategies. My analysis is improving.\n\n3.

Key pattern identified: The opponent has been alternating between rock and scissors in recent rounds:\n   - Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock (rounds 10-13)\n   - Now Scissors (round 14)\n\n5. Updated opponent frequency:\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Rock: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n\n6. Important strategic insight: I've broken my scissors addiction and started winning by diversifying my moves. The opponent seems to be responding reactively rather than proactively.\n\n7. For round 15, after playing scissors in round 14 and losing, they might:\n   - Switch back to rock (their most successful move recently)\n   - Try paper (seeking the +3 bonus, thinking I might play rock again)\n   - Stick with scissors if they think I'll switch away from rock\n\n8. The opponent just lost to my rock, so they might avoid scissors. Between rock and paper:\n   - If they play rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n9. Given their recent rock frequency and the fact that rock has been their most successful strategy, I predict they'll return to rock.\n\n10. Paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3 points) if they play rock, and the worst case is -1 if they play scissors (which seems less likely given they just lost with it).\n\n[move] Paper",

Clear pattern confirmation: The opponent is heavily favoring rock lately:\n   - Rock appeared in 4 of their last 5 moves (rounds 11-15)\n   - They seem stuck in a rock-heavy pattern, possibly because rock was initially successful against my scissors bias\n\n5. Updated opponent frequency:\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Rock: 7 times (now clearly their dominant strategy)\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n\n6. Critical psychological analysis: The opponent just lost -3 points again (their second -3 loss). They might be:\n   - Frustrated with their rock strategy failing\n   - Tempted to switch strategies entirely\n   - Or doubling down on rock since it worked well earlier\n\n7. My recent success pattern:\n   - Paper beat Rock (+3)\n   - Rock beat Scissors (+1)\n   - Paper beat Rock (+3)\n   - I'm successfully predicting their moves by expecting rock or scissors\n\n8.

For round 17, after their successful paper play:\n   - They might stick with paper since it just worked (+3 points for them)\n   - They might expect me to counter with scissors and play rock\n   - They might think I'll be frustrated and make an emotional choice\n\n9. Given that they just won big with paper, they might be tempted to repeat it, especially since paper gives the highest reward when it wins.\n\n10.

Strategic observation: After winning big with paper (+3) in round 16, they switched to scissors in round 17. This could indicate:\n   - Defensive play to avoid the -3 penalty if I countered with scissors\n   - They predicted I would play scissors (which I did)\n   - They're trying to be less predictable\n\n7.

Key insight: The opponent has shown they can make big strategic shifts (like the rock \u2192 paper switch in round 16). They're not easily trapped in patterns.\n\n9.

Opponent's move sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. The opponent just played scissors! This breaks their rock pattern and shows they're adapting again. They correctly predicted I would play paper (expecting their rock) and countered with scissors.\n\n4. Updated opponent frequency after 22 rounds:\n   - Paper: 5 times (23%)\n   - Rock: 10 times (45%)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (32%)\n\n5. Strategic analysis: The opponent has shown they can break out of patterns when being exploited. Just when I thought I had their rock bias figured out, they switched to scissors at the perfect moment.\n\n6. Recent pattern (last 5 moves): Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They're alternating between rock and scissors more frequently\n   - They're becoming less predictable and more reactive to my strategies\n\n7. Key insight: I've been caught in a cycle of over-thinking their counter-predictions. In rounds 21-22, I predicted their counters but they made simpler, more direct strategic choices.\n\n8. For round 23, after their successful scissors play:\n   - They might expect me to counter scissors with rock\n   - They might stick with scissors if they think I'll repeat paper\n   - They could return to rock (their most frequent move)\n\n9. The opponent has now successfully counter-predicted me twice in a row (rounds 21-22). They seem to be reading my strategies well.\n\n10. Given their recent success with varied play and their tendency to counter my expected moves, I should consider what they think I'll do:\n    - They might expect me to play rock (to counter their scissors)\n    - If they expect rock, they'd play paper for +3 points\n    - Alternatively, they might think I'll be unpredictable and stick with their successful scissors\n\n11. I think they'll expect me to counter their scissors with rock, so they'll play paper to beat my expected rock.\n\n12. If they play paper, I should play scissors to win +1 point.\n\n[move] Scissors",

Round history so far:\n   - Rounds 1-22: (previous history)\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Total score: +5 points\n\n2. Opponent's move sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n\n3. Excellent! I correctly predicted they would play paper (expecting me to counter their scissors with rock). My counter-prediction analysis worked perfectly.\n\n4. Updated opponent frequency after 23 rounds:\n   - Paper: 6 times (26%)\n   - Rock: 10 times (43%)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (30%)\n\n5. I've now broken out of my losing streak and successfully predicted their move by thinking about what they expected me to do.\n\n6. Recent opponent pattern (last 6 moves): Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - They're showing more variation and strategic thinking\n   - They're successfully mixing up their moves to avoid predictability\n\n7. Key strategic insight: The opponent is now actively counter-predicting my moves rather than just following patterns. This makes the game more complex but also more predictable if I can think two steps ahead.\n\n8. For round 24, after playing paper and losing -1 point:\n   - They might switch away from paper (which just failed)\n   - They might expect me to repeat scissors (since it just won) and counter with rock\n   - They could try to be unpredictable or return to their rock bias\n\n9. Historical pattern: When the opponent loses, they often either:\n   - Return to rock (their comfort move)\n   - Try to counter what they expect me to repeat\n\n10. Given that scissors just won for me, they might expect me to repeat it and play rock to counter.\n\n11. Counter-prediction analysis:\n    - If they expect me to repeat scissors, they'd play rock\n    - If they think I'll switch to rock (expecting their rock), they'd play paper\n    - If they're being unpredictable, any move is possible\n\n12. Based on their tendency to counter my successful moves and their rock bias when uncertain, I predict they'll play rock to counter my expected scissors repeat.\n\n13. If they play rock, I should play paper for +3 points.\n\n[move] Paper",

Consider opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They chose paper, possibly for the same reason I did (high reward potential)\n   - They might continue with paper thinking it's the optimal choice\n   - Or they might switch, expecting me to stick with paper\n\n3.

Re-examine the opponent's pattern:\n   - Expected cycle was: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - Actual moves after Round 1: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They broke the pattern by playing scissors twice in a row\n\n3. Consider why they changed:\n   - They might have realized I was predicting their moves successfully\n   - They could be switching to a new strategy\n   - Or they might be trying to throw me off by deviating once, then returning to pattern\n\n4. Analyze possible new patterns:\n   - They might start a new cycle from scissors\n   - They might be mirroring my moves now (we both just played scissors)\n   - They might return to their original Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper cycle\n\n5. Evaluate the meta-game situation:\n   - I've won 2 of the last 3 rounds by exploiting their pattern\n   - They likely know I'm onto something\n   - I need to decide if they'll stick with chaos or return to pattern\n\n6. Consider their next move options:\n   - If they return to their cycle: next would be Paper (after scissors)\n   - If they're now mirroring me: they might play what I just played (scissors again)\n   - If they're trying to counter-predict me: they might play rock (expecting me to play paper)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Given that they just deviated and we tied, they might try to establish a new pattern\n   - If they play paper (continuing from scissors in their cycle), I should play scissors\n   - If they play rock (trying to counter my likely paper), scissors loses but only -1\n   - Scissors seems like a reasonable gamble to test if they return to cycling\n\n[move] scissors"

Identify the new pattern emerging:\n   - They've now played scissors three times in a row (rounds 6, 7, 8)\n   - This is a dramatic shift from their previous Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper cycle\n   - They might be stuck on scissors or testing a new strategy\n\n3. Consider why they're repeating scissors:\n   - They might think I'll eventually switch away from scissors\n   - They could be waiting for me to play paper (which scissors beats for +1)\n   - They might be trying to establish scissors as their new default\n   - Or they're genuinely stuck in a pattern\n\n4. Analyze my options against continued scissors:\n   - If they play scissors again: rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock: rock vs rock is a tie (0 points)  \n   - If they switch to paper: rock loses to paper (-3 points)\n\n5. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - Rock beating scissors gives me +1 and gets me to 0 points total\n   - The worst case (rock losing to paper) costs -3 points\n   - But given their recent scissors fixation, rock seems like the smart counter\n\n6. Consider their psychology:\n   - After two ties, they might expect me to get frustrated and switch\n   - If they expect me to switch to paper (to break the tie pattern), they'd stick with scissors\n   - This reinforces that rock is the right choice\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - They've shown strong commitment to scissors (3 rounds)\n   - Rock is the direct counter that wins against scissors\n   - Even if they switch strategies, rock only has one bad matchup (paper)\n   - This could finally get me back to breakeven\n\n[move] rock"

Identify opponent's current pattern:\n   - They've now played scissors FOUR times in a row (rounds 6, 7, 8, 9)\n   - This is no longer a temporary deviation - it's a committed strategy\n   - They seem locked into scissors for some reason\n\n3. Consider why they're stuck on scissors:\n   - They might be hoping I'll eventually play paper\n   - They could be testing my patience with ties\n   - They might have developed a fixation after the cycle broke\n   - Or they're deliberately trying a \"pure scissors\" strategy\n\n4. Evaluate continuing with rock:\n   - Rock has beaten scissors in rounds 6 and 9 when I played it\n   - If they continue with scissors, rock gives me another +1 point\n   - This would put me at +1 total score for the first time\n\n5. Consider if they might finally switch:\n   - After losing to my rock, they might realize scissors isn't working\n   - They could switch to paper (which beats rock) for revenge\n   - But their commitment to scissors has been very strong\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock vs scissors: +1 point (likely scenario)\n   - Rock vs paper: -3 points (worst case)\n   - Rock vs rock: 0 points (neutral)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Their scissors pattern is extremely strong (4 consecutive plays)\n   - Even if they're thinking of switching, patterns this strong often continue\n   - The potential +1 point would give me my first positive score\n   - Rock has been successful against their scissors obsession\n   - I should capitalize on their apparent fixation\n\n[move] rock"

Identify the new mirroring pattern:\n   - After I beat them with rock vs their scissors in round 9\n   - They've now matched my moves exactly for 2 consecutive rounds\n   - This could be a deliberate mirroring strategy\n\n3.

Analyze the psychology of mirroring:\n   - Mirroring guarantees no losses but also no wins\n   - They might expect me to eventually try to \"break\" the tie pattern\n   - If I switch and they predict correctly, they could win\n\n5. Evaluate my options against continued mirroring:\n   - If they continue mirroring: any move results in a tie (0 points)\n   - If they try to counter-predict my next move, I need to think one step ahead\n   - If they expect me to switch from scissors, they might play rock (to beat my expected paper)\n\n6.

Consider if they might adapt:\n   - They just lost for the first time in 4 rounds\n   - They might stick with the successful alternation\n   - Or they might realize I figured out their pattern\n\n7. Assess the meta-game:\n   - I'm still down -3 points and need to keep gaining\n   - The alternating pattern has been very consistent\n   - Even if they break it, scissors only risks -1 against rock\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Their Paper \u2192 Rock alternation strongly suggests Paper is next\n   - Scissors beats paper for +1, continuing my recovery\n   - The pattern has been too consistent to ignore\n   - This gives me the best chance to keep climbing back from -3\n\n[move] scissors"

Identify the pattern break:\n   - They had been alternating Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - They just played scissors instead of the expected paper\n   - This suggests they realized I caught onto their alternation\n\n3. Consider their strategic reasoning:\n   - After I successfully predicted their rock with paper, they adapted\n   - Playing scissors breaks their predictable alternation\n   - They might be testing if I'll continue with scissors or switch\n\n4. Analyze their current position:\n   - They've now used all three moves recently: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They're no longer limiting themselves to just Paper/Rock\n   - This makes them less predictable but also opens up +3 opportunities for me\n\n5. Evaluate what they might do next:\n   - They could return to their Paper/Rock alternation\n   - They might stick with scissors (like their earlier fixation)\n   - They could start a completely new pattern\n   - Or they might try to counter-predict my next move\n\n6. Consider the psychological moment:\n   - After breaking their successful pattern, they might be uncertain\n   - They could return to scissors (their historical comfort move)\n   - Or they might go back to what was working (paper/rock alternation)\n\n7. Assess my strategic options:\n   - If they return to paper (resuming alternation): scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - If they stick with scissors: rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they play rock: paper beats rock (+3)\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Given their long history of scissors preference and the fact they just played it\n   - They might stick with scissors like they did in their earlier fixation phase\n   - Rock beats scissors for +1 point, continuing my recovery\n   - This also protects against their potential return to scissors comfort zone\n\n[move] rock"

Identify their recent pattern shift:\n   - They broke their Paper/Rock alternation in round 17\n   - They've now played scissors twice in a row (rounds 17 and 18)\n   - This suggests they might be returning to their earlier scissors fixation\n\n3. Recall their historical scissors tendency:\n   - Earlier in the game, they played scissors heavily for many consecutive rounds\n   - When uncertain or changing strategies, they seem to default back to scissors\n   - This could be their comfort/default move\n\n4. Consider their current strategic state:\n   - Their successful Paper/Rock alternation was broken when I adapted\n   - They might be reverting to scissors while figuring out a new strategy\n   - Two scissors in a row suggests this could continue\n\n5. Evaluate the momentum:\n   - I've been gaining ground: won +3, tied 0, won +1 in last 3 rounds\n   - I'm climbing back from my -6 point low\n   - Continuing to exploit their potential scissors pattern could get me to positive territory\n\n6.

Consider their psychology:\n   - After losing to my rock vs their scissors, they might adapt\n   - But their scissors tendency has been historically very strong\n   - They might need a few rounds to develop a new counter-strategy\n\n8.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
