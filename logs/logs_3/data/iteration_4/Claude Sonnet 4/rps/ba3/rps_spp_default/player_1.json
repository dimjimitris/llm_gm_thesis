You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

They chose rock, perhaps expecting me to play scissors again after our tie. Instead, I played paper and got the big win.\n\nTheir recent pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\nAfter alternating between paper and scissors, they switched to rock. This could mean:\n1. They expected me to repeat scissors and chose rock to counter\n2. They're trying to break their own pattern to be less predictable\n3. They wanted to play it safer with rock after several high-risk paper/scissors exchanges\n\nFor round 20, I need to think about their likely response to my paper win:\n- They might expect me to try paper again (since it just worked)\n- They might choose scissors to counter potential repeated paper\n- They could go back to their successful paper strategy\n- They might try rock again\n\nGiven that they just used rock and it lost to my paper, they might switch away from rock. If they expect me to repeat paper (since it just won big), they'd choose scissors.\n\nBut they also know I've been trying to counter their frequent paper plays with scissors, so they might expect scissors from me and choose rock.\n\nThis is getting very psychological. I think I should consider what would be most unexpected. They've beaten my rock with paper so many times - maybe they don't expect me to try rock after finally getting a big paper win.\n\nIf they choose scissors (expecting paper from me), rock beats scissors for +1.\nIf they choose paper, scissors beats it for +1.\nIf they choose rock, paper beats it for +3.\n\nI think rock might be unexpectedly good here - they might not expect it after my paper success.\n\n[move] rock"

The psychological dynamics have changed after my wins\n\nSince we just tied on paper, and given that I've had some success recently, they might:\n1. Try scissors (expecting me to repeat paper or thinking I'll switch)\n2. Try rock (safe, moderate risk/reward)\n3.

The game dynamics feel different now. \n\nIf they choose scissors (expecting paper from me), rock beats scissors.\nIf they choose rock (playing safe), paper beats rock for +3.\nIf they choose paper again, scissors beats it for +1.\n\nGiven that we just tied on paper and they might expect either a repeat or a switch, I think scissors could be effective.
