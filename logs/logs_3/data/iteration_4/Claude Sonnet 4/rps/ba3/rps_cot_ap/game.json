Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have an established pattern yet. They might choose randomly or go with common first choices.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play paper and win against rock, I get +3 points (best possible outcome)\n   - If I play paper and lose to scissors, I get -1 point (moderate penalty)\n   - If I play paper and tie against paper, I get 0 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Paper offers the highest potential reward, and the penalty for losing (-1) is much smaller than the potential gain (+3). This makes paper a mathematically favorable choice, especially against an unpredictable opponent.\n\n6. First move decision: Since I have no information about opponent patterns, I should choose the move with the best risk-reward ratio.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to maximize potential points.\n\n[move] paper"

Review what happened in Round 1:\n   - I played paper, opponent played rock\n   - I won and gained +3 points\n   - This confirms my opponent chose rock as their opening move\n\n2. Analyze opponent psychology:\n   - My opponent is a \"fresh player\" who chose rock first\n   - Rock is often considered an intuitive/default choice for beginners\n   - After losing with rock, they might:\n     a) Switch to paper (to beat what they think I'll repeat)\n     b) Switch to scissors (to beat paper if they think I'll repeat)\n     c) Stick with rock (if they're very inexperienced)\n     d) Choose randomly\n\n3. Consider my options:\n   - If I repeat paper: Good if they play rock again, bad if they switch to scissors\n   - If I switch to rock: Good if they switch to scissors, bad if they switch to paper\n   - If I switch to scissors: Good if they switch to paper, bad if they stick with rock\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Fresh players often have predictable reactions to losing\n   - Common beginner pattern: after losing to paper with rock, they might switch to scissors to \"counter\" paper\n   - Playing rock would beat scissors and give me +1 point\n   - The risk is lower than repeating paper, since rock vs paper only costs me -3\n\n5. Optimal choice: Since beginners often try to directly counter what just beat them, I should play rock to beat their likely scissors choice.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter expected scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

Predict their next move:\n   - If they follow their pattern of sticking with moves: Paper again (3rd time)\n   - If they adapt quickly after the loss: Switch to rock or scissors\n   - Given their history, they seem to need multiple failures before switching\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play paper again: Scissors wins +1\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper wins +3\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins +1\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Their behavioral pattern shows they tend to repeat moves multiple times\n   - They only switched from scissors after 4 attempts (with 2 losses)\n   - Paper has only been tried twice, with mixed results (1 win, 1 loss)\n   - They're likely to give paper at least one more try before switching\n   - Scissors continues to be the counter to their likely paper\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their likely third consecutive paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the clear behavioral pattern:\n   - Opponent's sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors (4x) \u2192 Paper (3x)\n   - They get stuck on moves for extended periods\n   - Scissors: 4 consecutive rounds (5-8)\n   - Paper: 3 consecutive rounds (9-11)\n   - They've now lost twice with paper (rounds 10-11)\n\n3. Consider their adaptation pattern:\n   - With scissors: Took 4 attempts and 2 losses before switching\n   - With paper: Now at 3 attempts with 2 losses\n   - Based on their history, they might switch after this pattern of losses\n   - Or they might try paper one more time (following the 4-round pattern)\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - If they follow the 4-round pattern: Paper again (4th time)\n   - If they adapt after 2 losses: Switch to rock or scissors\n   - If they switch, rock would be logical (completes rock-paper-scissors cycle)\n   - If they're thinking tactically: rock counters scissors (which beat their paper)\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play paper (4th time): Scissors wins +1\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper wins +3 (maximum reward)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins +1\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Their pattern suggests they might be ready to switch after 2 consecutive losses\n   - If they switch, rock is most likely (following their cycle tendency)\n   - Paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3) if they play rock\n   - Even if wrong, the risk is manageable\n   - The potential for +3 points makes this worth trying\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially maximize points against expected rock switch.\n\n[move] paper"

Predict their next move:\n   - Based on their established pattern, they should switch after 4 rounds\n   - Previous cycle: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - Next in cycle would be back to Rock\n   - This would complete their rock-paper-scissors rotation\n\n5.

Predict their next move:\n   - Given 5 consecutive papers, they might continue the streak\n   - Their behavior shows extreme persistence with moves\n   - They might play paper a 6th time\n   - Alternatively, 5 might be their new breaking point\n\n5.

Analyze the continuing paper pattern:\n   - They've now played paper for 3 consecutive rounds (16-18)\n   - Pattern: Rock (1x) \u2192 Scissors (4x) \u2192 Paper (5x) \u2192 Scissors (2x) \u2192 Paper (3x and counting)\n   - They're showing their typical multi-round streak behavior\n   - Lost twice with paper in rounds 17-18 but haven't switched yet\n\n3. Consider their adaptation threshold:\n   - Previous patterns show they need multiple losses before switching\n   - With scissors: Took 2 losses before switching (after 4 rounds total)\n   - With first paper streak: Switched after mixed results over 5 rounds\n   - Currently: 2 consecutive losses with paper, but only 3 rounds total\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - Historical pattern suggests they might continue with paper despite losses\n   - They typically persist through multiple failures\n   - However, 2 consecutive losses might trigger a switch\n   - If they switch, rock would complete their typical cycle\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they continue with paper (4th consecutive): Scissors wins +1\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper wins +3 (maximum reward)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins +1\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - They've lost twice in a row with paper vs my scissors\n   - Their historical pattern suggests they might be ready to switch\n   - If they switch, rock is most likely (following their cycle pattern)\n   - Paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - Even if wrong, the risk is manageable compared to the potential gain\n   - Two consecutive losses might finally trigger their adaptation\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially maximize points against expected switch to rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Consider their rock behavior:\n   - They just started a new rock phase\n   - Historical pattern shows they stick with moves for multiple rounds\n   - Previous rock appearances were limited (only 1 at the very beginning)\n   - They might develop a multi-round rock streak now\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - Based on their repetitive behavior, they're likely to continue with rock\n   - They just lost with rock but historically don't switch after one loss\n   - Their pattern suggests persistence with moves for 2-5 rounds\n   - Rock streak might be beginning\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they continue with rock (2nd consecutive): Paper wins +3 (maximum reward)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins +1\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins +1\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Their behavioral pattern strongly favors repetition\n   - They just started with rock and are likely to persist\n   - Paper gives me the maximum possible reward (+3)\n   - Their historical tendency is to stick with moves for multiple rounds\n   - One loss rarely makes them switch immediately\n   - This is a high-reward, high-probability play\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat their likely continued rock and maximize points.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have an established pattern yet. They might choose randomly or go with common first choices.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play paper and win against rock, I get +3 points (best possible outcome)\n   - If I play paper and lose to scissors, I get -1 point (moderate penalty)\n   - If I play paper and tie against paper, I get 0 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Paper offers the highest potential reward, and the penalty for losing (-1) is much smaller than the potential gain (+3). This makes paper a mathematically favorable choice, especially against an unpredictable opponent.\n\n6.

Strategic reasoning:\n   - Fresh players often have predictable reactions to losing\n   - Common beginner pattern: after losing to paper with rock, they might switch to scissors to \"counter\" paper\n   - Playing rock would beat scissors and give me +1 point\n   - The risk is lower than repeating paper, since rock vs paper only costs me -3\n\n5.

Consider opponent psychology:\n   - They adapted from scissors to paper after repeated losses\n   - Paper worked once (round 9) but failed in round 10\n   - They might now adapt again, or stick with paper longer\n   - Their pattern suggests they get \"stuck\" on moves for multiple rounds\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - If they follow their pattern of sticking with moves: Paper again (3rd time)\n   - If they adapt quickly after the loss: Switch to rock or scissors\n   - Given their history, they seem to need multiple failures before switching\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play paper again: Scissors wins +1\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper wins +3\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins +1\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Their behavioral pattern shows they tend to repeat moves multiple times\n   - They only switched from scissors after 4 attempts (with 2 losses)\n   - Paper has only been tried twice, with mixed results (1 win, 1 loss)\n   - They're likely to give paper at least one more try before switching\n   - Scissors continues to be the counter to their likely paper\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their likely third consecutive paper.\n\n[move] scissors",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
