Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n\n2. Notice the asymmetry: Paper has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, while rock and scissors only give +1 when they win.\n\n3. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't know this payoff structure yet.\n\n4. Fresh players often default to rock as their first move (it's psychologically the most common opening move in standard rock-paper-scissors).\n\n5. If the opponent plays rock, I should play paper to get the maximum +3 points.\n\n6. Even if they don't play rock, paper is strategically strong because:\n   - If they play rock: I win +3 points\n   - If they play scissors: I lose only -1 point\n   - If they play paper: Tie (0 points)\n\n7. The risk-reward ratio favors paper since the potential gain (+3) is much higher than the potential loss (-1).\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to maximize expected value against a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the incredible pattern shift:\n   - Opponent went from predictable scissors-heavy to perfect mirroring\n   - They're now matching my exact moves for 3 rounds straight\n   - This suggests either:\n     a) They're deliberately mirroring my strategy\n     b) They're using the same logical process I am\n     c) Pure coincidence (very unlikely)\n\n3.

Key insight from this round:\n   - When I stopped over-predicting and went back to rock, they played scissors\n   - This suggests they might revert to their comfort zone (scissors) when the meta-game gets too complex\n   - My overthinking may have been exactly what they were exploiting\n\n3.

Brilliant opponent strategy analysis:\n   - They taught me that repeating rock gets punished with paper\n   - Then they let me win with rock again to recreate the same setup\n   - When I avoided rock (having \"learned\"), they punished that avoidance with scissors\n   - They're playing my psychology, not just the game moves\n\n3. Meta-psychological warfare:\n   - First they punished my pattern (rock repetition)\n   - Then they punished my learning (rock avoidance)\n   - They're staying ahead of my adaptation cycle\n   - Current total score: +1 point\n\n4. What they likely expect now:\n   - They might think I'll be frustrated and play randomly\n   - They might expect me to go back to rock (since avoiding it failed)\n   - They might expect me to try scissors (to beat their recent scissors)\n   - Or they might expect complete confusion\n\n5. Strategic realization:\n   - This opponent is playing at a master level\n   - They're manipulating my decision-making process itself\n   - Traditional game theory and psychology aren't enough\n   - I need to accept they may simply be superior\n\n6. Approach options:\n   - Try to out-think them (has failed repeatedly)\n   - Play randomly (removes their psychological advantage)\n   - Go back to basics (what historically worked most)\n   - Accept the challenge and make the best fundamental choice\n\n7. Historical success analysis:\n   - Rock has been my most successful move overall against this opponent\n   - Their most frequent move is still scissors\n   - Despite the traps, rock vs scissors has won me the most points\n\nFinal decision: Play rock - go back to the fundamentally sound choice that has worked most often, accepting that this opponent may counter it but it's still my best statistical option.\n\n[move] rock"

            "text": "Another rock vs scissors win, but I'm in a very familiar and dangerous position. I need to think carefully about this pattern.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the current situation:\n   - Round 18: Rock beat scissors (+1)\n   - Round 19: Paper lost to scissors (-1) \n   - Round 20: Rock beat scissors (+1)\n   - Current total score: +2 points\n\n2. Pattern recognition - this is the THIRD time I'm in this exact position:\n   - **First time:** Rock beat scissors \u2192 repeated rock \u2192 lost to paper (-3)\n   - **Second time:** Rock beat scissors \u2192 avoided rock \u2192 lost anyway (-1)\n   - **Third time (now):** Rock beat scissors \u2192 ???\n\n3. The opponent's sophisticated strategy:\n   - They keep creating the same \"rock just beat scissors\" scenario\n   - They've shown they can punish both repeating rock AND avoiding rock\n   - They're testing what I'll do when faced with the same decision repeatedly\n\n4. Meta-analysis of their approach:\n   - Round 1 trap: Punished rock repetition with paper\n   - Round 2 trap: Punished rock avoidance with scissors  \n   - Round 3 setup: Back to the same decision point again\n\n5. What they might expect this time:\n   - They've shown they can counter both my \"repeat\" and \"avoid\" strategies\n   - They might expect me to be completely confused\n   - They might expect me to try something completely different\n   - Or they might expect me to go back to rock (since it just worked again)\n\n6. Strategic options analysis:\n   - Rock: If they expect repetition, they'll play paper (-3)\n   - Paper: If they expect avoidance like before, they'll play scissors (-1)\n   - Scissors: If they play rock (expecting my rock), I lose (-1)\n\n7. Key insight:\n   - This opponent has consistently played scissors in this scenario\n   - Even when setting traps, they often use scissors as their tool\n   - Maybe the \"trap\" thinking is overthinking it\n   - Maybe they just prefer scissors and I should take the consistent +1\n\n8. Risk-reward reality check:\n   - Rock vs scissors = +1 (has happened multiple times)\n   - Rock vs paper = -3 (happened once, but devastating)\n   - The math still favors rock if scissors is their true preference\n\nFinal decision: Play rock again - take the statistical advantage, accepting that if it's a trap I'll learn from it, but the evidence suggests scissors is their default in this position.\n\n[move] rock"

            "text": "Fascinating! Four rock vs scissors wins now. This opponent keeps creating the same scenario but continues playing scissors. I need to analyze what's really happening here.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the extended pattern:\n   - Round 18: Rock beat scissors (+1)\n   - Round 19: Paper lost to scissors (-1)\n   - Round 20: Rock beat scissors (+1) \n   - Round 21: Rock beat scissors (+1)\n   - Current total score: +3 points\n\n2. Critical realization about the opponent's strategy:\n   - They consistently play scissors in the \"post-rock-win\" scenario\n   - Even when I think they're setting traps, they keep playing scissors\n   - The only exception was when they punished my first rock repetition with paper (Round 14)\n\n3. Pattern analysis across all games:\n   - Scissors remains their most frequent move overall\n   - When they create the \"rock just won\" scenario, they almost always follow with scissors\n   - The one paper trap (Round 14) might have been the exception, not the rule\n\n4. Revised understanding of opponent psychology:\n   - Maybe they're not as trap-focused as I thought\n   - Maybe scissors is their genuine comfort zone/default\n   - Maybe I was over-interpreting their strategic sophistication\n   - The rock vs scissors matchup keeps working because they prefer scissors\n\n5. Strategic reassessment:\n   - If scissors is truly their preference, rock should keep winning\n   - The trap-thinking might have been making me overthink simple patterns\n   - Rock has now beaten scissors 4 times when I've been in this position\n\n6. Risk consideration for next move:\n   - If I play rock again and they finally spring the paper trap: -3 points\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors again: +1 point\n   - If I avoid rock and they play scissors: I miss the +1 opportunity\n\n7. Statistical reality:\n   - In this specific \"rock just won\" scenario, they've played scissors 4 out of 5 times\n   - Only once did they play paper (the trap in Round 14)\n   - The odds heavily favor scissors from them\n\n8. Decision framework:\n   - Accept that rock vs scissors might just be the fundamental dynamic\n   - Stop overthinking the trap scenarios\n   - Take the statistical advantage\n\nFinal decision: Play rock - the pattern is too consistent to ignore. They seem to default to scissors in this scenario despite my expectations of traps.\n\n[move] rock"
