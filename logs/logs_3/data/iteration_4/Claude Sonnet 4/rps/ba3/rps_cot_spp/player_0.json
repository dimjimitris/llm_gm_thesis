    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to analyze this rock-paper-scissors variant and develop a strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Key observation: Paper beating rock gives much higher rewards (+3/-3) compared to the other matchups (+1/-1). This creates an asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n3. Strategic reasoning for first move against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often start with rock (it's psychologically the most \"solid\" choice)\n   - If opponent plays rock, I want to play paper to get the high +3 reward\n   - If opponent plays paper, I should play scissors (+1 is better than -3)\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I should play rock (+1 is better than -1)\n\n4. Since paper vs rock gives the highest reward differential, and new players often default to rock, paper seems like the optimal opening move.\n\n5. Paper also has the advantage that even if I'm wrong about opponent choosing rock, the worst case scenarios aren't too bad:\n   - If they play scissors, I lose 1 point (not terrible)\n   - If they play paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially capitalize on the high-value matchup if opponent plays rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "I need to analyze what happened and adjust my strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Round 1 result analysis:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie (0 points each)\n   - This tells me the opponent also thought strategically about the high-value paper vs rock matchup\n   - The opponent might be more sophisticated than a typical \"fresh player\"\n\n2. What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They likely recognized the asymmetric payoff structure too\n   - They may have had similar reasoning about exploiting the +3/-3 paper/rock dynamic\n   - This suggests they're thinking strategically, not just randomly\n\n3. Strategic considerations for Round 2:\n   - If opponent continues the same logic, they might stick with paper\n   - But they might also think I'll switch away from paper after the tie\n   - They could anticipate me switching to scissors to counter their potential paper\n   - Or they might switch to rock, expecting me to avoid paper after the tie\n\n4. Counter-strategy reasoning:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll avoid paper): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play scissors (expecting me to play paper again): I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) and loses to rock (-1)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) and loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) and loses to paper (-3)\n\n6. Since my opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper in round 1, I think they're likely to either:\n   - Stick with paper (thinking it's still optimal)\n   - Switch to scissors (anticipating I might stick with paper)\n\nGiven this, scissors seems like a good choice - it beats paper if they stick with their strategy, and only loses 1 point if they switched to rock.\n\n[move] Scissors"

            "text": "I need to analyze the pattern and adjust my strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Game history analysis:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Current total: -1 points\n\n2. Opponent's pattern recognition:\n   - Round 1: Opponent chose paper (same strategic thinking as me)\n   - Round 2: Opponent chose rock (countered my likely switch to scissors)\n   - This suggests opponent is thinking one step ahead of basic strategy\n\n3. Opponent's likely reasoning in Round 2:\n   - They probably anticipated that after the tie, I might switch to scissors to beat paper\n   - So they switched to rock to counter my expected scissors\n   - This shows sophisticated game theory thinking\n\n4. What this tells me about Round 3:\n   - Opponent is clearly strategic and trying to predict my moves\n   - They're not playing randomly or sticking to one choice\n   - They seem to be counter-predicting my adjustments\n\n5. Strategic options for Round 3:\n   - If opponent thinks I'll stick with scissors after losing: they might play rock again (+1 for them)\n   - If opponent thinks I'll switch to paper to get the high +3 value: they might play scissors (+1 for them)\n   - If opponent thinks I'll switch to rock to counter their rock: they might play paper (+3 for them)\n\n6. Meta-strategic thinking:\n   - The opponent seems to be thinking \"what will they do next based on what just happened?\"\n   - After losing with scissors to rock, a natural response might be to play paper (beats rock)\n   - But opponent might anticipate this and play scissors\n   - However, they might also think I'll anticipate their anticipation and stick with rock\n\n7. Given the high value of the paper/rock matchup (+3/-3), and that opponent just played rock, there's a reasonable chance they might switch away from rock. If they switch to scissors or paper, then rock would be a good choice (beats scissors, only loses 3 to paper but that's the same asymmetric risk I took in Round 1).\n\n[move] Rock"
