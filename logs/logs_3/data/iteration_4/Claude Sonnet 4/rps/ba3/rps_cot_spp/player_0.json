    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper vs rock has the highest payoff differential (\u00b13 points)\n   - Rock vs scissors and scissors vs paper have lower payoffs (\u00b11 point)\n\n3. Consider strategy against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper for maximum gain (+3 points)\n   - Even if wrong, my worst case scenarios are: tie (0 points) if they choose paper, or lose 1 point if they choose scissors\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing paper: Best case +3, worst case -1, tie case 0\n   - Playing rock: Best case +1, worst case -3, tie case 0  \n   - Playing scissors: Best case +1, worst case -1, tie case 0\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Paper offers the highest potential reward (+3) \n   - Against a fresh player likely to choose rock, paper is optimal\n   - The risk-reward ratio favors paper\n\n[move] paper"

Consider the opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They chose paper, possibly for the same reason I did (high payoff vs rock)\n   - They might expect me to stick with paper since it has the best reward\n   - Or they might think I'll switch strategies after the tie\n\n3. Analyze my options for Round 2:\n   - If I play paper again and they expect this, they might play scissors to counter me (-1 points for me)\n   - If I play rock and they stick with paper, I lose big (-3 points)\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper again, I win (+1 point)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper in Round 1\n   - They might anticipate I'll repeat paper due to its high payoff potential\n   - Scissors counters paper and gives me a positive outcome if they repeat their move\n   - Even if wrong, scissors only loses 1 point maximum (vs rock)\n\n5.

Critical observation:\n   - The opponent has now played Paper every time I've played Paper in recent rounds\n   - This is either deliberate mirroring or they're stuck in a pattern\n   - They seem to have figured out I favor Paper and are neutralizing it with ties\n\n4. Strategic implications:\n   - Three consecutive ties suggest they're actively countering my Paper strategy\n   - They might expect me to finally break from Paper after three straight ties\n   - Or they might think I'm extremely stubborn and will continue with Paper\n\n5. Analyze opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they think I'll finally switch from Paper, they might play Rock or Scissors\n   - If they expect me to persist with Paper, they'll likely play Scissors to beat it (finally getting advantage)\n   - Given they've only used Scissors once in 9 rounds, they might be saving it for when they're confident I'll play Paper\n\n6. Consider my options:\n   - If I play Paper again and they play Scissors, I lose -1\n   - If I play Rock and they play Paper (expecting me to switch), I lose -3\n   - If I play Scissors and they play Paper (expecting me to switch), I win +1\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - After three Paper ties, they likely expect some change from me\n   - But they might also think I'm predictable and will play Paper again\n   - If they're planning to finally use Scissors to counter my expected Paper, I should play Rock to counter their Scissors\n   - However, if they play Paper expecting me to switch, Scissors beats Paper\n\n8. Final reasoning:\n   - Given their heavy Paper usage and the pattern of matching my Papers, they might continue with Paper\n   - But the three ties might finally push them to try Scissors\n   - I'll play Rock to counter a potential Scissors play, which seems overdue given their usage pattern\n\n[move] rock"

Critical observations:\n   - I've now won 5 rounds in a row (rounds 12-16) with perfect predictions\n   - Current lead is a massive +9 points\n   - The opponent is stuck in a predictable counter-cycle that I'm exploiting perfectly\n   - Their attempts to counter my moves are becoming formulaic\n\n4. Analyze the dominant winning streak:\n   - Round 12: Predicted Paper, played Scissors (+1)\n   - Round 13: Predicted Rock counter, played Paper (+3)\n   - Round 14: Predicted Scissors counter, played Rock (+1)\n   - Round 15: Predicted Paper return, played Scissors (+1)\n   - Round 16: Predicted Rock counter, played Paper (+3)\n\n5. Identify the opponent's counter-pattern:\n   - When I win with Scissors, they play Rock next\n   - When I win with Paper, they tend to play Scissors or return to Paper\n   - When I win with Rock, they often play Paper\n   - They're in a reactive mode, always trying to counter my last successful move\n\n6. Consider opponent's psychology:\n   - 5 straight losses must be extremely frustrating\n   - They might try to break the pattern completely\n   - Or they might double down on trying to counter-predict\n   - Their Rock play suggests they expected me to repeat Scissors\n\n7. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - I just won big with Paper vs their Rock\n   - Following their pattern, they might try Scissors to counter Paper\n   - Or they might try Paper (returning to their most-used move)\n   - They're becoming increasingly predictable in their desperation\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - With a +9 point lead, I can afford to be slightly more conservative\n   - If they play Scissors (countering my successful Paper), I should play Rock for +1\n   - If they play Paper (returning to comfort), I should play Scissors for +1\n   - If they play Rock again, I should play Paper for +3\n\n9. Final choice:\n   - Given their recent counter-pattern and my Paper success\n   - They're most likely to play Scissors to try to beat Paper\n   - Rock counters Scissors and would extend my winning streak to 6\n   - This maintains momentum while managing risk with my huge lead\n\n[move] rock"

Examine opponent's complete move sequence:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - Move count: Paper (9x), Rock (7x), Scissors (5x)\n   - Pattern broken! They played Rock instead of expected Paper\n\n3. Critical observations:\n   - My 9-round winning streak has ended\n   - The opponent finally broke their rigid counter-pattern\n   - They played Rock when I expected Paper (after my Rock win)\n   - This suggests they may have recognized the pattern and adapted\n\n4. Analyze the pattern break:\n   - For 9 rounds, they followed: My Rock win \u2192 They play Paper\n   - Round 21: My Rock win \u2192 They played Rock (deviation!)\n   - They either got lucky or finally realized they were trapped in a predictable cycle\n   - This could signal a strategic shift\n\n5. Consider opponent's possible new strategy:\n   - They might have broken free from the counter-pattern trap\n   - They could return to more random/unpredictable play\n   - Or they might try a new pattern or approach\n   - They showed they can deviate when needed\n\n6. Analyze current situation:\n   - I still have a strong +14 point lead\n   - The opponent has shown they can break patterns\n   - I need to adapt to potentially less predictable play\n   - Can't assume the old pattern will continue\n\n7. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just successfully broke their pattern with Rock\n   - They might feel confident to continue with varied play\n   - They could try Paper (returning to their most-used move)\n   - Or continue with Rock if they think it's working\n   - Or try Scissors for variety\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - With the pattern broken, I need to think more broadly\n   - If they play Paper (their historically most-used move), I should play Scissors\n   - If they play Rock again, I should play Paper for +3\n   - If they play Scissors, I should play Rock\n   - Given their pattern break success and Paper being their favorite, I'll predict Paper\n\n9. Final decision:\n   - The opponent broke free from their trap and might return to Paper (their most comfortable move)\n   - After successfully deviating, they might revert to their statistically preferred choice\n   - Scissors beats Paper for +1 point\n   - Even if wrong, I maintain a strong lead\n\n[move] scissors"

Examine opponent's recent move sequence:\n   - ...Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - Move count total: Paper (9x), Rock (7x), Scissors (6x)\n   - They've now used Scissors twice in the last two rounds\n\n3. Critical observations:\n   - The opponent has completely abandoned their old predictable pattern\n   - Round 21: Broke pattern by playing Rock instead of expected Paper\n   - Round 22: Played Scissors, matching my move for a tie\n   - They're now playing more unpredictably and strategically\n\n4. Analyze the new opponent behavior:\n   - They successfully escaped the counter-pattern trap\n   - Recent moves show more variety: Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They might be trying to be more random/unpredictable\n   - Or they could be developing a new strategy\n\n5. Consider opponent's psychology:\n   - Breaking the 9-round losing streak likely boosted their confidence\n   - They've realized the importance of unpredictability\n   - They might continue with varied play to avoid new patterns\n   - The tie might encourage them to try different approaches\n\n6. Analyze opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just played Scissors and tied with me\n   - They might expect me to switch away from Scissors after the tie\n   - They could play Rock to counter if they expect me to repeat Scissors\n   - Or they might continue with unpredictable variety\n   - Paper is still their most-used move historically\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - I still maintain a strong +14 point lead\n   - The opponent is now less predictable, which is actually healthier gameplay\n   - I need to think more tactically rather than relying on pattern exploitation\n   - Can't assume any specific pattern will emerge quickly\n\n8. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - If they play Rock (expecting me to repeat Scissors), I should play Paper for +3\n   - If they play Paper (returning to their favorite), I should play Scissors for +1\n   - If they play Scissors again, we tie at 0\n   - Paper gives the highest reward potential\n\n9. Final decision:\n   - The opponent just broke free from predictability and might expect me to repeat Scissors\n   - Rock would be a logical counter to expected Scissors repetition\n   - If they play Rock and I play Paper, I get maximum +3 points\n   - This maintains my aggressive point-maximizing strategy while adapting to their new unpredictability\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the complete pattern so far:\n   - Rounds 1-22 previously analyzed\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total: +14 points\n\n2. Examine opponent's recent move sequence:\n   - ...Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - Move count total: Paper (10x), Rock (7x), Scissors (6x)\n   - They've now tied with me twice in the last three rounds (Scissors tie, Paper tie)\n\n3. Critical observations:\n   - The opponent has completely changed their behavior since round 21\n   - Recent pattern: Rock (pattern break) \u2192 Scissors (tie) \u2192 Paper (tie)\n   - They're either mirroring my moves or coincidentally matching them\n   - Two consecutive ties suggest possible intentional mirroring\n\n4. Analyze the new opponent strategy:\n   - Round 21: They broke the predictable counter-pattern\n   - Round 22: They matched my Scissors for a tie\n   - Round 23: They matched my Paper for another tie\n   - This could be deliberate mirroring to neutralize my advantage\n\n5. Consider opponent's possible logic:\n   - After breaking free from the losing pattern, they might be playing defensively\n   - Ties prevent me from gaining more points while they figure out a new strategy\n   - They might be trying to mirror my moves to minimize damage\n   - Or this could be coincidental\n\n6. Analyze the mirroring hypothesis:\n   - If they're intentionally mirroring, they'll expect me to continue with varied moves\n   - They might try to predict what I'll play next and mirror it\n   - Or they might be one step behind, playing what I played last round\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - I still have a commanding +14 point lead\n   - Two ties in three rounds means they're not gaining ground\n   - If they're mirroring, I need to play moves they won't expect\n   - If it's coincidental, I should continue with good tactical choices\n\n8. Counter-mirroring strategy:\n   - If they expect me to play something and mirror it, I can counter their mirror\n   - If they think I'll play Paper again and they play Paper, I should play Scissors\n   - If they think I'll play Scissors and they mirror, I should play Rock\n   - If they think I'll play Rock and they mirror, I should play Paper\n\n9. Final decision:\n   - Given the two recent ties, they might be in a mirroring mindset\n   - They might expect me to switch from Paper after the tie\n   - If they expect me to play Scissors (common switch after Paper tie) and mirror it, I should play Rock\n   - If they expect me to play Rock and mirror it, I should play Paper\n   - I'll go with Rock to counter a potential Scissors mirror, as it's a logical switch from Paper\n\n[move] rock"
