Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed any particular strategy yet. In rock-paper-scissors games, many beginners tend to start with Rock as it's often the first choice that comes to mind.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest potential payoff and I suspect the opponent might choose Rock, I should play Paper to counter it and gain 3 points.\n\n[move] Paper"

Some possible patterns:\n- They might stick with scissors\n- They might switch to rock (since rock beats scissors, they might think it's \"stronger\")\n- They might try paper next\n- They might try to counter my previous move (paper) with scissors again\n\nSince they're a fresh player, they might not have a sophisticated strategy yet. Many players tend to avoid repeating a losing move immediately, so scissors might be less likely this round.\n\nIf they switch to rock (a common reaction after losing), I should play paper again to get the high 3-point reward. If they play paper, I'd want scissors for the 1-point win. If they somehow play scissors again, rock would give me 1 point.\n\nGiven the high payoff potential of beating rock with paper (3 points), and that rock is a common choice for players who just lost, I'll go with paper again.\n\n[move] Paper"

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
