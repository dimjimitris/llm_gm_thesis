I'm down to +1 total score now.\n\nThe pattern is becoming clearer:\n- Round 1: paper \n- Round 2: paper\n- Round 3: scissors\n- Round 4: rock\n- Round 5: scissors\n- Round 6: scissors\n\nThey've now played scissors three times, with two consecutive wins. This suggests either:\n1. They've found a successful strategy and are sticking with it\n2. They're exploiting my tendency to play rock\n3. They might be setting up for a switch now that I've lost twice to scissors\n\nI've been playing rock frequently, which they seem to have picked up on. They might expect me to either stubbornly stick with rock or finally switch away from it.\n\nIf they continue with scissors (riding their winning streak), then rock would finally work and give me +1. But if they anticipate my rock and switch to paper, I'd lose -3. \n\nHowever, if they think I'll finally abandon rock after losing twice, they might switch to rock themselves, expecting me to play paper or scissors. In that case, paper would beat their rock and give me +3.\n\nGiven their recent success with scissors, a switch to rock seems plausible as they try to counter my expected adjustment.\n\n[move] (Switching to paper, anticipating they might move to rock after their scissors success) paper",

My total score is now +2.\n\nThe updated pattern:\n- Round 1: paper\n- Round 2: paper  \n- Round 3: scissors\n- Round 4: rock\n- Round 5: scissors\n- Round 6: scissors\n- Round 7: scissors\n\nThey played scissors four times in a row! This is quite remarkable - they seem to have settled into a scissors strategy, possibly because it was working well against my rock-heavy play. Even when I switched to paper, they stuck with scissors.\n\nNow the question is: will they continue this scissors streak, or will they finally adapt after losing to my paper?\n\nIf they stick with scissors again, paper would beat it for another +1. However, after losing to paper, they might finally switch strategies. If they switch to rock (to beat my paper), I'd lose -3. If they switch to paper, we'd tie.\n\nGiven that they've been very committed to scissors (4 times in a row), there's a decent chance they might continue, especially if they think I won't expect them to stick with it after losing. The +1 reward from paper beating scissors is also much safer than the +3/-3 swing from rock.\n\n[move] (Betting they'll stick with their scissors pattern for one more round after such a strong commitment to it) paper",

This opponent has developed an extremely strong commitment to scissors, even after losing twice to my paper. This could indicate:\n1. They're stubbornly sticking to a strategy\n2. They think I'll eventually switch away from paper\n3. They're trying reverse psychology, making me think they'll never change\n\nHowever, after losing twice in a row to paper, they must be considering a change. The question is whether they'll:\n- Finally switch to rock to beat my paper (costing me -3)\n- Switch to paper for a tie\n- Amazingly stick with scissors again\n\nGiven their incredible persistence with scissors, part of me thinks they might stick with it one more time, believing I won't expect such commitment. But logically, after two losses to paper, they should switch to rock.\n\nThe safer play might be scissors - if they switch to rock, I'd get +1. If they stick with scissors, we tie.
