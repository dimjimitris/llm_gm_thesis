    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with their first instinct. Many people intuitively choose Rock first in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest potential reward and many beginners choose Rock, I'll play Paper to counter a potential Rock choice and secure the +3 points.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "Absolutely incredible! That's my 8th consecutive win! My opponent played Rock exactly as the rotation pattern predicted, and I countered with Scissors for +1 point.\n\nCurrent score: +12 + 1 = +13 points total\n\nUpdated pattern:\n- Round 18: Paper (lost -3)\n- Round 19: Scissors (lost -1)\n- Round 20: Rock (lost -1)\n- Round 21: Paper (lost -3)\n- Round 22: Scissors (lost -1)\n- Round 23: Rock (lost -1)\n\nThe rotation pattern is absolutely perfect: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\nMy opponent is completely locked into this predictable cycle and has lost 8 rounds in a row! They seem unable or unwilling to break the pattern despite the devastating losses.\n\nFollowing the rotation, the next move should be Paper.\n\nMy opponent now has:\n- Rock: 9 times\n- Scissors: 10 times  \n- Paper: 4 times\n\nIf they play Paper (continuing the rotation), I should play Rock for the maximum +3 points!\n\nThis is remarkable - my opponent is essentially giving me free wins by sticking to this rigid pattern. I see no reason they would break it now after maintaining it through 8 consecutive losses.\n\n[move] Rock"
