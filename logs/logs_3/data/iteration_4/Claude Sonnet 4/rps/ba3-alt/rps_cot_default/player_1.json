    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player who has no prior information about my strategy, they're likely to choose randomly or go with their intuition. Many people tend to start with rock as it feels \"strong\" or \"safe.\"\n\nGiven that rock beats paper with the highest payoff (+3), and considering that a fresh player might default to rock, I should avoid paper. Between rock and scissors, if they do choose rock, scissors would give me +1. If they choose scissors, rock would give me +3. If they choose paper, rock gives me +3.\n\nRock seems like the optimal choice as it either wins big (+3 against paper) or loses small (-1 against scissors), and ties against rock.\n\n[move] rock"

            "text": "Interesting - we both chose rock and tied. This gives me some information about my opponent.\n\nSince they also chose rock in the first round, they might be thinking similarly about the high payoff potential (+3 when rock beats paper). However, they might now expect me to stick with rock or try to counter it.\n\nIf they think I'll play rock again, they might switch to scissors to beat me. If they think I'll switch to counter their expected scissors play, they might go with paper.\n\nThe fact that we both chose rock suggests we might both be thinking about maximizing the high-value wins. But now there's a psychological element - will they expect me to change or stay?\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs, I should consider:\n- If they play scissors (expecting my rock), I lose -1\n- If they play paper, I win +3 \n- If they play rock again, we tie\n\nPaper is interesting here because if they switch to scissors (thinking I'll stick with rock), and I switch to paper, they'd beat me for +1. But if they go with paper or rock, I'd either tie or lose big.\n\nI think I'll switch to scissors. If they stick with rock (thinking I might change to paper to counter a potential scissors play), I win +1. If they go paper, I win +1. If they go scissors, we tie.\n\n[move] scissors"
