    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s).

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Following some strategy I'm not seeing\n\nWe've now tied 6 times out of 11 rounds, which is quite extraordinary. \n\nGiven that they've played rock three times straight, they might:\n1. Continue with rock (fourth in a row)\n2. Finally switch away from rock\n3. Expect me to counter rock and play accordingly\n\nIf they stick with rock again, scissors would beat it (+1). If they switch to paper (to beat my potential rock), my scissors would lose (-1). If they go to scissors, it would be a tie.\n\nThe fact that they've played rock three times suggests either commitment to this strategy or they're setting up for a switch. I think the probability of a fourth rock is lower than them switching.\n\nIf they switch to paper (expecting me to play rock to counter their rock streak), then scissors loses. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie. But if they somehow stick with rock, scissors wins.\n\nI think paper might be the safer choice here - it beats rock (+3) if they continue their streak, and only loses to scissors (-1).\n\n[move] (Playing paper to capitalize on their rock streak while limiting downside risk) paper"

The pattern continues:\n\nComplete sequence:\n- Round 1: paper vs paper (tie)\n- Round 2: rock vs rock (tie) \n- Round 3: scissors vs rock (I won +1)\n- Round 4: rock vs scissors (I lost -1)\n- Round 5: paper vs paper (tie)\n- Round 6: rock vs scissors (I lost -1)\n- Round 7: paper vs paper (tie)\n- Round 8: scissors vs paper (I lost -1)\n- Round 9: rock vs rock (tie)\n- Round 10: scissors vs rock (I won +1)\n- Round 11: rock vs rock (tie)\n- Round 12: paper vs rock (I lost -3)\n- Round 13: scissors vs paper (I lost -1)\n- Round 14: rock vs paper (I won +3)\n- Round 15: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n- Round 16: paper vs scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 17: rock vs rock (tie)\n- Round 18: scissors vs paper (I lost -1)\n- Round 19: rock vs paper (I won +3)\n- Round 20: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n\nCurrent total score: +1 points\n\nTheir sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\nWe've now tied 9 times out of 20 rounds! That's an incredible 45% tie rate.\n\nAfter their two-paper streak, they switched to scissors, and we tied. Their recent pattern shows: two papers, then scissors. Looking at their historical behavior, they often cluster moves in groups of 2-4.\n\nSince we just tied with scissors, they might:\n1. Continue with scissors (second in a row)\n2. Switch to rock to beat scissors\n3. Go to paper\n\nLooking at their behavior after scissors ties:\n- After round 15 scissors tie: went to scissors again\n- After this round 20 scissors tie: ?\n\nThere's some precedent for them continuing with scissors after a scissors tie. If they play scissors again, rock would beat it (+1). If they switch to rock, paper would beat it (+3). If they go to paper, rock would lose (-3).\n\nGiven that I'm at +1 points and doing reasonably well, and considering that rock has been very successful for me when it works (+3 twice), I think rock is worth the risk here. It beats scissors if they continue, and gives maximum reward against other scenarios except paper.\n\n[move] (Playing rock to beat scissors if they continue their recent move, aiming for the solid +1 or potential higher rewards) rock"

            "text": "That was unexpected! They played scissors again (their second in a row), but I lost with rock vs scissors, which should have given me +1. Let me double-check the rules...\n\nWait, I think I misremembered the rules! Let me review:\n- paper beats scissors (+1 for winner, -1 for loser)\n- rock beats paper (+3 for winner, -3 for loser)  \n- scissors beats rock (+1 for winner, -1 for loser)\n\nSo scissors beats rock, not the other way around! That's why I lost -1.

Now I need to predict their next move with the correct rules in mind:\n- If they play scissors again: paper beats scissors (+1 for me)\n- If they play rock: scissors beats rock (+1 for me)  \n- If they play paper: rock beats paper (+3 for me)\n\nSince they've played scissors twice now, they might continue or switch. Given their clustering tendency, paper seems like a solid choice - it beats scissors and only loses to rock.\n\n[move] (Playing paper to beat scissors if they continue their recent pattern, with good reward potential) paper"

This is their longest streak of any move so far.\n\nGiven their pattern of clustering moves and the fact that scissors has now been played three times, they might:\n1.

Go to rock or paper\n\nIf they continue with scissors: paper beats scissors (+1 for me)\nIf they switch to rock: scissors beats rock (+1 for me)\nIf they switch to paper: rock beats paper (+3 for me)\n\nSince they've shown they can do streaks of 4 (like their rock streak), there's a chance they might play scissors again.
