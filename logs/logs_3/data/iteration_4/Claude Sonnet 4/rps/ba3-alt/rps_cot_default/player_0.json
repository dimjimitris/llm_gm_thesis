    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often start with common/intuitive moves\n   - Paper is often a popular first choice for beginners\n   - Rock is also common as it seems \"strong\"\n\n4. Optimal strategy consideration:\n   - If opponent chooses paper (likely for a new player), I win big with rock (+3 points)\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I lose with rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I lose with rock (-1 points)\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Rock has the highest upside (+3) but also highest downside (-3 if they play scissors)\n   - Given this is against a fresh player who might default to paper, rock seems like the best strategic choice\n\n[move] rock"

            "text": "Let me analyze this new information and adjust my strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Learn from the previous round:\n   - My opponent also chose rock\n   - This confirms that rock is indeed a popular choice for new players\n   - The opponent might stick with rock again or try to counter it\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might think: \"Rock tied, so maybe I should try something else\"\n   - They might switch to paper (thinking it beats rock)\n   - Or they might stick with rock thinking it's \"safe\"\n   - Less likely they'd choose scissors since new players often avoid it initially\n\n3. Analyze my best counter-strategies:\n   - If they stick with rock: any move gives me 0 points (tie)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock gives me +3 points (best outcome)\n   - If they switch to scissors: paper gives me +1 point\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock again: High reward (+3) if they switch to paper, neutral if they stick with rock, high penalty (-1) if they go scissors\n   - Paper: Moderate reward (+1) if they go scissors, high penalty (-3) if they stick with rock, neutral if they go paper\n   - Scissors: Moderate reward (+1) if they stick with rock, moderate penalty (-1) if they go paper, neutral if they go scissors\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Given that new players often switch after a tie and paper is a common \"counter\" to rock, I'll stick with rock for the high-reward potential\n\n[move] rock"
