    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the key insight: Rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose rock frequently (it feels \"strong\")\n   - Might default to rock as their first move\n   - Haven't yet learned to exploit the high-value rock strategy\n\n4. Develop opening strategy: Since rock gives +3 points when winning but -3 when losing, and fresh players often choose rock, I should play paper to counter rock and gain the maximum 3 points.\n\n5. Risk assessment: If opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point. If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points). If opponent plays rock, I gain 3 points. The potential high reward outweighs the small risk.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially counter a likely rock choice from the fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Consider opponent's next move psychology: \n   - They might stick with paper since it \"worked\" (didn't lose)\n   - They might switch to rock thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might try scissors to beat paper\n\n4. Evaluate my options for maximum expected value:\n   - If I play rock: beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with rock (0)\n   - If I play paper: beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3), ties with paper (0) \n   - If I play scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since the opponent chose paper in round 1, there's a reasonable chance they might:\n   - Repeat paper (in which case rock gives me +3)\n   - Switch to rock expecting me to repeat paper (in which case scissors gives me +1)\n   - Switch to scissors to counter my paper (in which case rock gives me +3)\n\n6.

Analyze their recent pattern:\n   - Last 4 moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They seem to be cycling through all three moves\n   - If continuing this variety, paper might be next\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent plays scissors: rock wins (+1), paper loses (-1), scissors ties (0)\n   - If opponent plays paper: scissors wins (+1), rock loses (-3), paper ties (0)\n   - If opponent plays rock: paper wins (+3), scissors loses (-1), rock ties (0)\n\n7. Strategic decision-making:\n   - Based on the post-rock-tie pattern (scissors after round 2), they might play scissors\n   - But they're showing more variety recently\n   - Rock gives me +1 vs scissors with only -3 risk vs paper\n   - Scissors gives me +1 vs paper with only -1 risk vs rock\n\n8. Risk assessment: Given they played scissors after the last rock tie and seem to be varying their moves, scissors is a reasonable prediction. I'll play rock to counter it.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat expected scissors, with manageable risk if they play paper.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze opponent's current situation:\n   - They just lost with scissors\n   - Their recent pattern: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They might switch away from scissors after losing\n\n5. Look at their behavior after losing with scissors:\n   - Previous losses with scissors were in rounds 3 and 10\n   - After round 3 loss: they played rock (round 4)\n   - After round 10 loss: they played rock (round 11)\n   - Pattern suggests: after losing with scissors, they play rock\n\n6. Evaluate my options if they play rock:\n   - If opponent plays rock: paper wins (+3), scissors loses (-1), rock ties (0)\n   - If opponent plays paper: scissors wins (+1), rock loses (-3), paper ties (0)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: paper wins (+1), rock loses (-1), scissors ties (0)\n\n7. Strategic analysis:\n   - Post-scissors-loss pattern strongly suggests rock\n   - Paper beats rock for maximum +3 points\n   - Paper also beats scissors for +1 if they repeat\n   - Only risk is -3 if they unexpectedly play paper, but this goes against their established pattern\n\n8. Risk/reward assessment:\n   - High probability of +3 points (rock expected)\n   - Good backup of +1 points (if scissors)\n   - Low probability of -3 points (if paper)\n   - Expected value is strongly positive\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat their likely rock move for maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] paper"

Check what just happened:\n   - I played paper, opponent played rock\n   - The message says I lost and scored -3 points\n   - According to the rules: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\"\n   - So rock beats paper, meaning opponent won (+3) and I lost (-3)\n   - This is correct scoring\n\n2. But this contradicts my prediction logic:\n   - I expected rock based on their post-scissors-loss pattern\n   - They DID play rock as I predicted\n   - But I should have played scissors to beat rock, not paper!\n   - I keep making the same mistake with the rules\n\n3. Correct rules review:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 vs -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 vs -3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 vs -1)\n\n4. Update my total score:\n   - Previous total: +2 points\n   - This round: -3 points\n   - New total: -1 point\n\n5. Analyze what I should have done:\n   - Predicted rock correctly\n   - Should have played scissors to beat rock for +1\n   - Instead played paper and lost -3\n\n6. Recent game history:\n   - Round 17: Both rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 18: I paper, opponent scissors - I won (+1)\n   - Round 19: I paper, opponent rock - I lost (-3)\n\n7. Consider opponent's next move:\n   - They just won big (+3) with rock\n   - They might stick with rock since it worked well\n   - Or they might switch to continue varying their play\n\n8. Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent plays rock again: scissors wins (+1), paper loses (-3), rock ties (0)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: rock wins (+1), paper loses (-1), scissors ties (0)\n   - If opponent plays paper: scissors wins (+1), rock loses (-3), paper ties (0)\n\n9. Strategic decision: Scissors beats both rock (if they repeat their winning move) and paper, with only -1 risk against rock. This gives me the best expected value.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat rock or paper, minimizing risk while maximizing potential gain.\n\n[move] scissors"
