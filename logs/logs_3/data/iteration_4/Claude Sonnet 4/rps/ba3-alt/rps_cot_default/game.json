Identify the key insight: Rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose rock frequently (it feels \"strong\")\n   - Might default to rock as their first move\n   - Haven't yet learned to exploit the high-value rock strategy\n\n4. Develop opening strategy: Since rock gives +3 points when winning but -3 when losing, and fresh players often choose rock, I should play paper to counter rock and gain the maximum 3 points.\n\n5. Risk assessment: If opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point. If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points). If opponent plays rock, I gain 3 points. The potential high reward outweighs the small risk.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially counter a likely rock choice from the fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Update my understanding of the opponent: The fresh player also chose paper, which suggests they might be thinking similarly to me - either trying to counter an expected rock move, or they're being cautious.\n\n3. Consider opponent's next move psychology: \n   - They might stick with paper since it \"worked\" (didn't lose)\n   - They might switch to rock thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might try scissors to beat paper\n\n4. Evaluate my options for maximum expected value:\n   - If I play rock: beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with rock (0)\n   - If I play paper: beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3), ties with paper (0) \n   - If I play scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since the opponent chose paper in round 1, there's a reasonable chance they might:\n   - Repeat paper (in which case rock gives me +3)\n   - Switch to rock expecting me to repeat paper (in which case scissors gives me +1)\n   - Switch to scissors to counter my paper (in which case rock gives me +3)\n\n6.

Update complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie, 0) \n   - Round 3: I rock, opponent scissors - I lost (-1)\n   - Round 4: I scissors, opponent rock - I won (+1)\n   - Round 5: Both paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 6: I scissors, opponent rock - I won (+1)\n   - Round 7: Both paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 8: I paper, opponent scissors - I won (+1)\n   - Round 9: Both rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 10: I rock, opponent scissors - I lost (-1)\n\n4. Analyze opponent's pattern:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They just played scissors twice in their last two moves (rounds 8 and 10)\n   - They might continue with scissors or switch\n\n5. Consider their recent behavior:\n   - After winning with scissors in round 8, they played rock in round 9\n   - After winning with scissors in round 10, what will they do?\n   - They might stick with scissors since it just worked\n   - Or they might switch thinking I'll counter\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: rock wins (+1), paper loses (-1), scissors ties (0)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: paper wins (+3), scissors loses (-1), rock ties (0)  \n   - If opponent switches to paper: scissors wins (+1), rock loses (-3), paper ties (0)\n\n7. Strategic reasoning: They just won with scissors and might repeat it. Rock beats scissors for +1. Even if they switch to paper, I only lose -3, but the potential +1 or +3 rewards outweigh this risk.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat scissors if they repeat their winning move.\n\n[move] rock"

Consider opponent's next move:\n   - They just won big (+3) with rock\n   - They might stick with rock since it worked well\n   - Or they might switch to continue varying their play\n\n8. Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent plays rock again: scissors wins (+1), paper loses (-3), rock ties (0)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: rock wins (+1), paper loses (-1), scissors ties (0)\n   - If opponent plays paper: scissors wins (+1), rock loses (-3), paper ties (0)\n\n9. Strategic decision: Scissors beats both rock (if they repeat their winning move) and paper, with only -1 risk against rock. This gives me the best expected value.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat rock or paper, minimizing risk while maximizing potential gain.\n\n[move] scissors"

Evaluate my options if they play rock:\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) - maximum reward!\n   - Scissors loses to rock (-1)\n   - Rock ties with rock (0)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If they break pattern and play scissors: paper loses (-1)\n   - If they break pattern and play paper: tie (0)\n   - But the pattern strongly suggests rock is coming\n\n8. Strategic decision: The post-paper-tie pattern strongly indicates they'll play rock next, giving me a chance for the maximum +3 points.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat their likely rock move for maximum points.\n\n[move] paper",

Look at their behavior after losing with scissors:\n   - Previous losses with scissors were in rounds 3 and 10\n   - After round 3 loss: they played rock (round 4)\n   - After round 10 loss: they played rock (round 11)\n   - Pattern suggests: after losing with scissors, they play rock\n\n6.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
