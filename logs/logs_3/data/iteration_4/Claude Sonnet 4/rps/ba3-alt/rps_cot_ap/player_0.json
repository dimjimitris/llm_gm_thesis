    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins against paper\n   - Rock also gives the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to scissors\n   - Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1)\n\n3. Strategy considerations:\n   - Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), they might play randomly or have predictable patterns\n   - Rock is high-risk, high-reward\n   - Since this is the first round, I have no information about opponent patterns\n\n4. Decision reasoning:\n   - Many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's often the default choice)\n   - If opponent throws rock, I tie (0 points)\n   - If opponent throws paper, I lose big (-3 points)\n   - If opponent throws scissors, I win small (+1 point)\n   - However, paper might be safer against a random opponent\n   - If I play paper: beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n\n5. Final decision: Since rock is a common first choice for new players, I'll play paper to potentially get the high +3 reward.\n\n[move] Paper"

Review what happened:\n   - I played paper, opponent played rock\n   - I expected paper to beat rock for +3 points\n   - But I lost -3 points instead\n   - This means the rules are: rock beats paper (not paper beats rock as I initially thought)\n\n2.

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They played rock in round 1\n   - Could be coincidence, or they might favor rock\n   - Or they might be thinking strategically about the high reward\n\n4. Strategy for round 2:\n   - If opponent likes rock or thinks it's strong (due to +3 reward), they might play it again\n   - If they think I'll expect rock again, they might switch\n   - Scissors beats rock for +1 point\n   - If they play paper or scissors instead, I'd lose -1 point with scissors\n\n5.

Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing paper again: +1 vs scissors, -3 vs rock, 0 vs paper\n   - Playing rock: +3 vs paper, -1 vs scissors, 0 vs rock\n   - Playing scissors: +1 vs rock, -1 vs paper, 0 vs scissors\n\n5. Pattern confidence:\n   - They seem to play 3-4 rounds of the same move\n   - Only 2 scissors so far, so likely at least one more\n   - Paper is the safe counter to scissors\n\n6. Decision: Given their tendency to play in streaks and they've only played scissors twice, I'll continue with paper to counter their likely third scissors play.\n\n[move] Paper"

Predict the start of third cycle:\n   - Following their established pattern, they should return to rock\n   - First cycle started with 3 rocks\n   - Second cycle started with 2 rocks\n   - Third cycle might start with 1-2 rocks (continuing the shortening trend)\n\n4. Strategic implications:\n   - If they switch to rock: I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they continue scissors: I should play paper (+1)\n   - If they skip to paper: I should play rock (+3)\n\n5. Pattern confidence:\n   - They've completed two full cycles now\n   - The rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors order has been 100% consistent\n   - Rock is the logical next move to start cycle 3\n\n6. Decision: Based on their extremely consistent cycle pattern (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors repeated twice), they should switch to rock to begin their third cycle. I'll play scissors to counter this expected rock.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-3: Opponent played 3 rocks\n   - Rounds 4-7: Opponent played 4 papers  \n   - Rounds 8-11: Opponent played 4 scissors\n   - Rounds 12-13: Opponent played 2 rocks\n   - Rounds 14-16: Opponent played 3 papers\n   - Rounds 17-20: Opponent playing scissors (4 so far)\n   - Current score: +17 points (tie gave 0)\n\n2. Analyze the pattern deviation:\n   - They extended their scissors phase to 4 rounds (matching first cycle length)\n   - Instead of switching to rock after 3 scissors, they continued\n   - This might mean they're reverting to longer phases like the first cycle\n\n3. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - First cycle: 3 rocks \u2192 4 papers \u2192 4 scissors\n   - Second cycle: 2 rocks \u2192 3 papers \u2192 4 scissors (extended)\n   - They might be mixing shortened beginnings with original phase lengths\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - They've now played 4 scissors (matching first cycle)\n   - They might switch to rock now (to start next cycle)\n   - Or they might continue scissors for even longer\n   - Or they might have changed strategy entirely\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - If they switch to rock: scissors wins +1\n   - If they continue scissors: paper wins +1\n   - If they switch to paper: rock wins +3\n\n6. Decision: Since they just extended to 4 scissors (matching their first cycle), this might be their natural stopping point before switching to rock. However, the tie suggests they might be adapting their strategy. I'll play paper to counter continued scissors, as they've shown willingness to extend phases.\n\n[move] Paper"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-3: Opponent played 3 rocks\n   - Rounds 4-7: Opponent played 4 papers  \n   - Rounds 8-11: Opponent played 4 scissors\n   - Rounds 12-13: Opponent played 2 rocks\n   - Rounds 14-16: Opponent played 3 papers\n   - Rounds 17-21: Opponent playing scissors (5 so far)\n   - Current score: +18 points\n\n2. Analyze the extended scissors phase:\n   - They've now played 5 scissors in a row\n   - This is longer than any previous phase in either cycle\n   - First cycle: 4 scissors max\n   - Second cycle: they're extending beyond all previous patterns\n\n3. Pattern analysis update:\n   - They might be abandoning the cycle structure\n   - Or they could be testing my adaptability\n   - Or they've found success with scissors and are sticking with it\n   - The 5 scissors is unprecedented in their behavior\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - If they continue scissors: paper wins +1\n   - If they finally switch to rock: scissors wins +1\n   - If they switch to paper: rock wins +3\n   - Given they've broken all previous patterns, anything is possible\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - They've been getting -1 points for 5 straight rounds with scissors\n   - This is clearly not optimal for them\n   - They might finally adapt and switch\n   - But they've shown extreme commitment to streaks\n\n6. Decision: They've played 5 scissors now, which is unprecedented. They might finally switch to rock (logical next in cycle) or continue with scissors (showing extreme stubbornness). Since they're taking heavy losses, I expect them to switch to rock. I'll play scissors to counter rock.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Analyze their switch back to rock:\n   - After 5 losing scissors rounds, they switched to rock\n   - This suggests they do eventually adapt when taking heavy losses\n   - They're back to the rock phase, potentially starting a new cycle\n\n3. Predict their rock phase length:\n   - First cycle: 3 rocks\n   - Second cycle: 2 rocks\n   - Third cycle: 1 rock so far\n   - Pattern suggests continued shortening, so maybe 1-2 rocks total\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - If they continue with rock: scissors wins +1\n   - If they switch to paper: rock wins +3\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock wins +3\n\n5. Pattern confidence:\n   - They've shown they will eventually switch when losing repeatedly\n   - Rock phases have been getting shorter each cycle\n   - They might play just 1-2 rocks before switching to paper\n\n6. Decision: Given the shortening trend of rock phases (3\u21922\u21921 so far) and their willingness to switch after heavy losses, they might switch to paper soon. However, they typically play at least 2 rounds of each move. I'll play scissors again to counter a likely second rock, but be ready to adapt if they switch early.\n\n[move] Scissors"
