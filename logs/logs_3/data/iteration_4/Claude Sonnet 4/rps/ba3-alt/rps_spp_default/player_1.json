    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper and Scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, I should consider what move gives me the best expected value. Many new players tend to start with Rock as it's often the first move people think of in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nIf the opponent chooses Rock, I should choose Paper to win 3 points.\nIf the opponent chooses Paper, I should choose Rock to win 3 points.\nIf the opponent chooses Scissors, I should choose Rock to win 3 points.\n\nGiven that Rock offers the highest potential reward and many beginners default to Rock, I'll play Paper to counter that tendency while also being well-positioned against Rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

My score remains at -5 points.\n\nCurrent game summary:\n- Through Round 13: +1 point\n- Rounds 14-20: -6 points total\n- Round 21: Both Rock (tie, 0 points)\n\nMy total score: -5 points\n\nMy opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\nThey switched back to Rock after the Scissors tie, following their typical post-tie switching pattern.\n\nI'm noticing something interesting - we've had a lot of ties recently:\n- Round 16: Both Rock\n- Round 19: Both Rock  \n- Round 20: Both Scissors\n- Round 21: Both Rock\n\nThis suggests we might be starting to think similarly, or they're anticipating my moves so well that they're matching them when I make \"safe\" choices.\n\nAt -5 points, I'm still in serious trouble. Looking at the bigger picture:\n- Every time I've played Paper, they've crushed me with Rock (-3 each time)\n- When I play Rock, they often counter with Scissors (-1 each time)\n- My only significant wins have come from Scissors beating Rock\n\nGiven their recent Rock play and following their post-tie switching tendency, they might switch away from Rock. If they go to:\n- Scissors: I should play Rock (+3)\n- Paper: I should play Rock (+3) \n- Rock again: We tie (0)\n\nBut wait - maybe I should consider that they've been reading my \"logical\" moves too well. They seem to anticipate when I'll switch strategies.\n\nWhat if I try Paper? It's been disastrous before, but maybe they won't expect it after all the recent Rock plays and ties.\n\nActually, no. Paper has cost me 9 points. I need to stick with moves that can win big but limit downside.\n\n[move] Scissors"

            "text": "Excellent! Finally broke the tie streak with a win. My Scissors beat their Rock for +1 point.\n\nCurrent game summary:\n- Through Round 13: +1 point\n- Rounds 14-21: -6 points total\n- Round 22: My Scissors vs Their Rock (won, +1 point)\n\nMy total score: -4 points\n\nMy opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n\nThey stayed with Rock after the tie (breaking their usual post-tie switching pattern), and I finally capitalized on it with Scissors.\n\nI'm still at -4 points but moving in the right direction. The key insight is that Rock has been very profitable for them throughout the game, so they might be reluctant to abandon it completely.\n\nNow they just lost with Rock. Looking at their behavior after losing with Rock:\n- Previous Rock losses led to switches to Scissors or Paper\n- But Rock has been so successful for them (+3 multiple times) that they might stick with it\n\nThey might:\n1. Switch to Scissors (to counter if I play Rock again)\n2. Switch to Paper (mixing it up)\n3. Stay with Rock (it's been their most profitable move)\n\nGiven that I just won with Scissors, they might expect me to either:\n- Play Scissors again (since it worked)\n- Switch to Rock (my historical preference)\n\nIf they think I'll play Rock, they'll counter with Scissors.\nIf they think I'll play Scissors again, they'll counter with Rock.\n\nThis is a critical decision. I need more wins to climb out of this -4 hole.\n\nRock beats both Scissors and Paper for +3 points each, while only tying with Rock. Given my deficit, I need to go for the high-value plays.\n\n[move] Rock"

            "text": "Fantastic! A big +3 point win with Rock beating their Paper. This is exactly what I needed.\n\nCurrent game summary:\n- Through Round 13: +1 point\n- Rounds 14-21: -6 points total\n- Round 22: My Scissors vs Their Rock (won, +1 point)\n- Round 23: My Rock vs Their Paper (won, +3 points)\n\nMy total score: -1 point\n\nMy opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n\nInteresting! They switched to Paper after losing with Rock. This is the first time they've played Paper in a while, and it cost them dearly against my Rock.\n\nI'm now back to just -1 point, much better than the -5 I was at earlier. Two wins in a row have really helped.\n\nThey just lost with Paper (their first Paper in many rounds). What will they do next?\n\nLooking at their pattern after losing:\n- After Paper losses, they've typically switched moves\n- They might go back to their reliable Rock or try Scissors\n\nThey might think:\n1. I'll stick with Rock (since it just won big)\n2. I'll switch to Scissors (to counter Rock)\n3. I'll try Paper again (doubling down)\n\nIf they play Scissors to counter my Rock, I should play Rock (+3 points)\nIf they play Rock, we tie (0 points)\nIf they play Paper again, I win with Rock (+3 points)\n\nWait, that logic is wrong. If they play Scissors, Rock loses (-1 point). Let me reconsider:\n\nIf they play Scissors (to counter Rock), I should play Rock to win (+3 points) - NO, that's backwards. Scissors beats Rock.\n\nLet me think clearly:\n- If they play Scissors, I should play Rock to lose (-1) - NO! I should play Paper to win (+1)\n- If they play Rock, I should play Paper to win (+3)\n- If they play Paper, I should play Rock to win (+3)\n\nActually, I think I should play Paper to counter potential Scissors, but Paper has been disastrous for me historically.\n\nGiven the momentum of two wins, I'll stick with Rock for the high reward potential.\n\n[move] Rock"
