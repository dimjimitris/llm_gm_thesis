    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Players often choose moves that \"feel strong\" - rock fits this\n\nGiven that rock is statistically the most likely first move from a fresh player, we should play paper to counter it and gain +3 points.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** That makes sense.

The expected value calculation supports this:\n- If opponent plays Rock (high probability): Paper wins +3\n- If opponent plays Scissors (lower probability): Paper loses -1  \n- If opponent plays Paper (moderate probability): Tie, 0 points\n\nThe high reward for beating rock with paper outweighs the modest penalty for losing to scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed.

            "text": "Now I have information from the previous round - my opponent also played paper. Let me collaborate with my personas to adjust strategy.\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nPsychology Expert: Interesting! The opponent played paper, not rock as we predicted. This gives us valuable information about their decision-making patterns. They either:\n1. Had similar strategic thinking to us (countering expected rock)\n2. Have some game theory knowledge\n3. Made a random choice that happened to be paper\n\nThis suggests they might not be as \"fresh\" as initially indicated, or they're thinking strategically.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The tie actually worked in our favor - we avoided the -1 penalty we would have gotten if they played scissors. Now we need to think about their next move. If they're strategic, they know we both played paper. They might:\n1. Stick with paper (if they think it's optimal)\n2. Switch to scissors (to counter our potential repeat of paper)\n3. Switch to rock (for the high reward potential)\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given that they showed strategic thinking by playing paper, I think they're less likely to repeat it. They might anticipate we'll stick with paper and counter with scissors. But they also might think we'll think that and play rock instead.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is getting into higher-order thinking. Since they demonstrated strategic capability, they might expect us to change our strategy. However, many players have a tendency to switch after a tie. If they switch to scissors expecting us to repeat paper, we should play rock to get the +3 points.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree with the rock choice. The reasoning is:\n- If they play scissors (likely if they expect us to repeat paper): Rock wins +1\n- If they play paper (less likely after the tie): Rock wins +3\n- If they play rock (possible but less predictable): Tie, 0 points\n\nRock gives us the best expected value against a strategic opponent who just tied with paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock\n\n[move] (Switching to rock since opponent showed strategic thinking with paper and may counter-expect me to repeat paper with scissors) rock"
