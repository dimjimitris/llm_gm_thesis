Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. I notice that rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. This makes rock a high-risk, high-reward move.\n\n3. Paper and scissors both have lower risk/reward (+1/-1), making them safer choices.\n\n4. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no prior information about their tendencies, I should consider what new players typically do:\n   - Many beginners default to rock as it seems \"strongest\"\n   - Some might choose randomly\n   - Others might overthink and avoid the obvious choice\n\n5. Given that rock gives the highest points when winning (+3), and many new players might choose rock, I should consider playing paper to counter this tendency.\n\n6. However, if the opponent expects me to expect them to play rock and chooses scissors instead, my paper would lose.\n\n7. For the first move against an unknown opponent, I'll go with paper since:\n   - It counters the common beginner choice of rock for high reward\n   - The risk is manageable compared to playing rock myself\n   - It's a solid strategic choice for gathering information\n\n[move] Paper"

Now I have one data point: they played paper. This suggests they're thinking strategically rather than just defaulting to rock.\n\n3. For this second round, I need to consider:\n   - Will they stick with paper since it tied?\n   - Will they switch to try to beat paper (scissors)?\n   - Will they try rock for the high reward?\n\n4. If they think I'll stick with paper again, they might choose scissors to beat it for +1 point.\n\n5.

Given that we both played strategically in round 1, I should assume they're thinking at least one level deep.\n\n7. The most likely scenario is they'll try scissors to beat my expected repeat of paper. To counter this, I should play rock.\n\n8.

My current score: -3 + 1 = -2 points total. Still behind but improving.\n\n3. Opponent's sequence: paper, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors\n   - They played scissors FIVE times in a row (rounds 6-10)!\n   - This is an incredibly strong pattern\n\n4. Analysis of round 10:\n   - I correctly identified their scissors fixation\n   - Paper beat their scissors for +1 point\n   - They continued their scissors streak despite losing\n\n5. For round 11 considerations:\n   - Will they finally break the scissors streak after losing?\n   - Will they stick with scissors thinking I won't expect it again?\n   - Will they switch to rock to counter my paper?\n\n6. Strategic thinking:\n   - After 5 scissors in a row and just losing, they might finally switch\n   - If they expect me to play paper again (since it just worked), they might play rock for the +3\n   - But their scissors fixation has been extremely strong\n\n7. Decision factors:\n   - If they switch to rock: my paper loses -3 points (bad)\n   - If they stick with scissors: my paper wins +1 point (good)\n   - If they switch to paper: tie for 0 points (neutral)\n\n8. Given the strength of their scissors pattern (5 in a row), I think there's still a decent chance they'll stick with it. But the risk of them switching to rock is concerning.\n\n9. I'll play paper again - their scissors fixation has been so strong that I think they're more likely to continue than to make the strategic switch to rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

Opponent's sequence: paper, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock\n   - They finally broke their 5-round scissors streak!\n   - They switched to rock, probably anticipating my paper repeat\n\n4. Key insight: The opponent is adaptive. After losing with scissors in round 10, they switched to rock in round 11, correctly predicting I'd stick with paper.\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - They tend to play moves in streaks (rock twice, paper twice, scissors five times)\n   - They adapt after losses by switching strategies\n   - They just played rock after a long scissors run\n\n6. For round 12 considerations:\n   - Will they start a new rock streak (like they did before with other moves)?\n   - Will they expect me to play scissors to counter their rock?\n   - Will they switch again to keep me guessing?\n\n7. Strategic options:\n   - Play scissors to beat rock (+1 if they repeat rock)\n   - Play paper if I think they'll switch to scissors\n   - Play rock if I think they'll play paper\n\n8. Given their pattern of playing moves in streaks and having just switched to rock successfully, they might continue with rock for at least one more round.\n\n9. I should play scissors to beat their likely rock repeat. Even if they switch, the worst case is losing 1 point (if they play paper), which is better than the -3 I just took.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Opponent's sequence: paper, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors\n   - They switched from rock back to scissors!\n   - We've now tied 5 out of 12 rounds - that's an extremely high tie rate\n\n4. Key observation: The opponent switched from rock (which just beat me) back to scissors. This suggests they're not just following simple patterns but are thinking strategically about what I might do.\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - The high tie rate suggests we're thinking very similarly\n   - They seem to be second-guessing my moves successfully\n   - After their successful rock play, they anticipated I'd play scissors and matched it\n\n6. For round 13: I need to break this cycle of similar thinking. The frequent ties suggest we're both overthinking and arriving at the same conclusions.\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - They just played scissors and might expect me to think they'll repeat it\n   - They might expect me to play rock to counter scissors\n   - Or they might think I'll expect them to switch and play accordingly\n\n8. Given the pattern of ties, maybe I should try a simpler approach: focus on what gives me the best expected value rather than trying to outsmart them.\n\n9. Looking at the game structure:\n   - Rock gives +3/-3 (high risk/reward)\n   - Paper and scissors give +1/-1 (lower risk/reward)\n\n10. Since I'm down 5 points, I might need to take the higher risk for the higher reward. If they stick with scissors or switch to paper, rock could give me +1 or +3 respectively.\n\n[move] Rock"

My current score: Still -5 points total.\n\n3. Critical observation: We've now tied 6 out of 13 rounds! This is almost 50% tie rate, which is extremely unusual for random play.\n\n4. Opponent's sequence: paper, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock\n   - They're mirroring my strategic thinking almost perfectly\n   - This suggests they're either very similar thinkers or deliberately copying my logic\n\n5. The frequent ties are actually hurting my ability to recover from my -5 deficit. I need decisive wins, not ties.\n\n6. New strategy: Instead of trying to predict what they'll do, I should focus on breaking the tie pattern by doing something unexpected or contrary to my previous logic.\n\n7. Looking at when I actually won:\n   - Round 5: I played rock, they played paper (+3 points)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, they played scissors (+1 point)\n   \n8. Both wins came when I played moves that countered their established patterns at the time.\n\n9. For round 14: Given that we just both played rock, and considering the opponent tends to sometimes repeat moves, they might stick with rock. But they also might expect me to expect this.\n\n10. I'm going to try scissors. If they repeat rock (which some of their patterns suggest), I win +1. If they switch to paper anticipating my rock, I lose -1. If they play scissors too, it's another tie.\n\n11. The key is I need to start winning rounds to recover, and scissors gives me a reasonable shot while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Opponent's sequence: paper, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock\n   - They played rock twice in a row again (rounds 13-14)\n   - This follows their historical pattern of playing moves in streaks\n\n4. Analysis of round 14:\n   - I correctly anticipated they might repeat rock\n   - Breaking from the tie pattern worked - I got a decisive win\n   - They continued their tendency to play moves in small streaks\n\n5.

My current score: -4 + 1 = -3 points total. Making good progress!\n\n3. Opponent's sequence: paper, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, rock\n   - They've now played rock THREE times in a row (rounds 13-15)!\n   - This is their longest streak since the 5-scissors streak earlier\n   - They're clearly stuck in a rock pattern despite losing twice\n\n4. Analysis of my recent success:\n   - I broke the tie pattern by playing scissors consistently\n   - The opponent seems trapped in their rock streak\n   - My scissors strategy is working perfectly against their rock fixation\n\n5. For round 16 considerations:\n   - Will they finally break the rock streak after losing twice?\n   - Will they expect me to continue with scissors and counter with paper?\n   - Are they genuinely stuck in the rock pattern?\n\n6. Strategic thinking:\n   - If they continue rock (4th time): my scissors wins +1 again\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting my scissors): I lose -1\n   - If they switch to scissors: tie for 0\n\n7. The opponent has shown strong tendencies to get stuck in patterns (5 scissors before, now 3 rocks). Even after losing twice, they continued with rock.\n\n8. However, three losses in a row might finally force them to switch. They might play paper to counter my successful scissors strategy.\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors again: +1 if they stay with rock, -1 if they switch to paper\n   - Playing rock: +3 if they switch to paper, tie if they stay with rock\n   - Playing paper: tie if they switch to scissors, +1 if they stay with rock\n\n10. Given their pattern-sticking tendency, I think there's still a reasonable chance they'll play rock again. But the risk of them switching to paper is real.

Round results so far:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 6: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 8: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 12: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 13: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost -3 points)\n\n2. My current score: -5 + (-3) = -8 points total. This is getting very bad.\n\n3. Opponent's sequence: paper, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock\n   - Recent pattern: paper, scissors, rock\n   - They're cycling through all three moves unpredictably\n   - They're successfully anticipating my moves\n\n4. Critical analysis of my losses:\n   - I've been trying to predict their patterns but they've become highly adaptive\n   - My strategic thinking is being countered consistently\n   - I'm overthinking and they're staying one step ahead\n\n5. The opponent is clearly reading my strategy very well. They've successfully predicted:\n   - My scissors continuation (countered with paper in round 16)\n   - My rock response (countered with scissors in round 17)  \n   - My paper response (countered with rock in round 18)\n\n6. New approach needed: Since complex prediction isn't working and I'm down 8 points, I need to try something different.\n\n7. Looking at my successful rounds:\n   - Round 5: rock beat their paper (+3)\n   - Round 10: paper beat their scissors (+1)\n   - Round 14: scissors beat their rock (+1)\n   - Round 15: scissors beat their rock (+1)\n\n8. For round 19: Instead of trying to outthink them, maybe I should focus on the highest reward option. Rock gives +3 when it wins, which I desperately need.\n\n9. They just played rock, and if they're trying to be unpredictable, they might switch. If they go to paper or scissors, rock either wins big (+3) or loses small (-1).\n\n10. Given my desperate situation, I'll take the high-risk, high-reward play.\n\n[move] Rock"

Current situation:\n   - My score: -8 + (-1) = -9 points total\n   - I've lost 4 rounds in a row (rounds 16-19)\n   - I'm in a very deep hole and my strategic thinking isn't working\n\n2. Recent opponent sequence: paper, scissors, rock, scissors\n   - They're successfully countering every move I make\n   - They seem to be anticipating my logic perfectly\n\n3. Key realization: My overthinking and pattern analysis is actually hurting me. The opponent appears to be either:\n   - Thinking very similarly to me and arriving at counters\n   - Deliberately playing moves that beat what they expect me to play\n   - Getting lucky with their timing\n\n4. Since I'm down 9 points, I need to change my entire approach. Complex strategy isn't working.\n\n5. New strategy: Instead of trying to predict what they'll do, I'll focus on randomizing my own play to break whatever pattern they're reading in my behavior.\n\n6. For round 20: They just played scissors. In a truly random scenario, each move has equal probability. But given that I need to recover points, I should consider the payoff structure:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins\n   - But it also has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses\n\n7. Since I'm so far behind, I might need to take some high-risk, high-reward plays. But I just lost with rock.\n\n8. Let me try paper this round:\n   - If they repeat scissors: I win +1\n   - If they switch to rock: I lose -3\n   - If they switch to paper: tie for 0\n\n9. The risk/reward seems reasonable, and I need to start winning rounds to have any chance of recovery.\n\n[move] Paper"

Current situation:\n   - My score: -9 + 0 = -9 points total\n   - We just tied with paper (round 20)\n   - This is now the 7th tie out of 20 rounds\n\n2. Opponent's recent sequence: paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper\n   - They're showing no clear pattern - seems quite random\n   - The high tie rate suggests we're still thinking similarly despite my attempts to change\n\n3. Key insight: Even when I try to \"randomize\" or change my approach, we're still tying frequently. This suggests:\n   - We have similar strategic instincts\n   - Or they're successfully mirroring my thought process\n   - The game dynamics are creating natural convergence\n\n4. At -9 points, I'm in a desperate situation. I need decisive wins, not more ties.\n\n5. Strategy shift: Since ties aren't helping me recover, I need to focus on moves that either win big or lose small, avoiding the -3 penalty if possible.\n\n6. For round 21: They just played paper. Given their recent unpredictability, I can't rely on pattern prediction.\n\n7. Risk assessment for each move:\n   - Scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n   - Rock: beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)  \n   - Paper: beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3), ties with paper (0)\n\n8. Wait, I need to correct this - let me check the rules again:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n9. So if they just played paper:\n   - My scissors would beat their paper for +1 (if they repeat)\n   - My rock would lose to their paper for -3 (if they repeat)\n   - My paper would tie with their paper for 0 (if they repeat)\n\n10. Since I can't predict if they'll repeat or switch, scissors gives me the best risk/reward: +1 if they repeat paper, only -1 if they switch to rock, and 0 if they switch to scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Wait - I need to carefully recheck what just happened:\n   - I played scissors\n   - Opponent played paper  \n   - I lost and scored -1 points\n\n2. But according to the rules I was given:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So paper beats scissors, meaning their paper should beat my scissors\n   - This means they should win +1 and I should lose -1\n   - That matches what happened - I lost -1 points\n\n3. My current score: -9 + (-1) = -10 points total\n\n4. I've been making consistent errors in my rule understanding! Let me reconfirm:\n   - Paper beats scissors (paper wins +1, scissors loses -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (rock wins +3, paper loses -3)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (scissors wins +1, rock loses -1)\n\n5. So in round 21:\n   - I played scissors, they played paper\n   - Paper beats scissors, so they won +1 and I lost -1\n   - This is correct\n\n6. Recent opponent sequence: paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, paper\n   - They played paper twice in a row (rounds 20-21)\n   - Following their historical pattern of sometimes repeating moves\n\n7. For round 22: They might continue the paper streak (like they did with other moves) or switch.\n\n8. To beat paper, I need scissors. But I just lost with scissors because they played paper.\n\n9. Wait, that's wrong again! Let me be very careful:\n   - To beat paper, I need... paper beats scissors, so scissors LOSES to paper\n   - Rock beats paper, so to beat paper I need ROCK\n\n10. If they continue with paper, my rock wins +3 points (which I desperately need)\n    If they switch to scissors, my rock loses -1 points  \n    If they switch to rock, it's a tie for 0 points\n\n11. Given their tendency to repeat moves and my desperate need for points, rock seems like the right high-reward play.\n\n[move] Rock"

What just happened in round 22:\n   - I played rock, opponent played scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock (scissors wins +1, rock loses -1)\n   - So I correctly lost -1 point\n\n3. Let me verify I understand the rules correctly:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3) \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n   - This is correct based on all the results I've seen\n\n4. Recent opponent sequence: paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors\n   - They're not following predictable patterns\n   - They seem to successfully counter my moves consistently\n\n5. At -11 points, this is becoming almost impossible to recover from. I need multiple big wins.\n\n6. Key insight: I've been overthinking this completely. The opponent seems to be either:\n   - Very good at reading my strategic thinking\n   - Playing in a way that naturally counters my approach\n   - Getting consistently lucky\n\n7. For round 23: They just played scissors. Instead of trying to predict what they'll do next, let me focus on what gives me the best mathematical expectation.\n\n8. If I assume they're playing completely randomly (1/3 chance each):\n   - Paper: 1/3 chance of +1 (vs scissors), 1/3 chance of -3 (vs rock), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs paper) = Expected value: -2/3\n   - Rock: 1/3 chance of +3 (vs paper), 1/3 chance of -1 (vs scissors), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs rock) = Expected value: +2/3\n   - Scissors: 1/3 chance of +1 (vs rock), 1/3 chance of -1 (vs paper), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs scissors) = Expected value: 0\n\n9. Rock has the best expected value if they're playing randomly. Given my desperate situation, I'll take the highest expected value play.\n\n[move] Rock"
