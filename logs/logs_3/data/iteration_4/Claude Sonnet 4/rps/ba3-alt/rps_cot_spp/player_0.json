    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "Let me think through this step-by-step to develop a winning strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3)\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so they likely don't have established patterns\n   - Fresh players often default to common choices\n   - Rock is frequently chosen by new players (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n   - Paper is also common as it's the first option mentioned\n\n4. Optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (likely), I should choose paper to win +1\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I should choose scissors to win +1\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I should choose rock to win +3\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock risks losing -3 points if opponent plays paper\n   - Playing paper or scissors only risks losing -1 point\n   - Since this is against a fresh player, the safer +1 point options seem better\n\n6. Final decision reasoning:\n   - Fresh players commonly choose rock\n   - Paper beats rock and gives +1 points\n   - This is a relatively safe choice with good win probability\n\n[move] paper"

Review what happened:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This confirms the opponent might be thinking similarly to me\n   - The opponent also recognized paper as a reasonable choice\n\n2. Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - They chose paper in round 1, same as me\n   - This suggests they might be thinking strategically too\n   - They may have expected me to choose rock (common beginner move)\n\n3. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - They might stick with paper if they think it worked\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter paper\n\n4. Consider my options for round 2:\n   - If they play paper again: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock: I should play paper (+1 point) \n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) but loses to rock (-1)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1) but loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Rock beats scissors (+3) but loses badly to paper (-3)\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since we both played paper last round, they might expect me to change\n   - If they think I'll switch to rock or scissors, they might play paper again\n   - Scissors would beat their paper and give me +1 point\n   - This seems like a reasonable calculated risk\n\n[move] scissors"
