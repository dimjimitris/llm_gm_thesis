    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, while the other moves only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Consider the risk-reward trade-off: \n   - If I play rock and win (opponent plays paper), I get +3 points\n   - If I play rock and lose (opponent plays scissors), I get -1 point\n   - The potential gain (+3) significantly outweighs the potential loss (-1)\n\n4. Factor in opponent psychology: Against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't know the payoff structure well, they may play randomly or use standard rock-paper-scissors intuition.\n\n5. Make the strategic decision: Rock offers the best expected value due to its high payoff when winning, making it the optimal choice especially against an inexperienced opponent.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to maximize potential points.\n\n[move] rock"

Review what just happened:\n   - I played rock, opponent played paper\n   - Rock beats paper, so I won +3 points\n   - This confirms the payoff structure is working as described\n\n2. Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent chose paper in round 1\n   - Since I won with rock, they experienced a -3 point loss\n   - They now know rock gives high rewards/penalties\n\n3. Predict opponent's likely response:\n   - Having just lost badly to rock (-3 points), they may try to counter it\n   - The counter to rock is scissors (scissors beats rock for +1/-1)\n   - Alternatively, they might avoid paper since it just failed against rock\n\n4. Consider my optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (expecting me to repeat rock), I should play rock to beat scissors\n   - Wait - that's wrong. Let me recalculate: scissors beats rock, so if they play scissors and I play rock, I lose -1 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I should play paper (paper beats scissors for +1/-1)\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic choice:\n   - Playing paper covers the most likely opponent response (scissors)\n   - Even if wrong, paper's maximum loss is -3 (if opponent plays rock)\n   - But paper's win condition gives +1, which is still positive\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely scissors response.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze opponent's surprising pattern change:\n   - Rounds 8-10: scissors, scissors, scissors (three in a row!)\n   - This breaks their previous pattern of switching after losses\n   - They're now sticking with scissors despite mixed results\n   - Scissors beat rock twice (rounds 8, 10) but lost to paper once (round 9)\n\n3. Recognize the new meta-strategy:\n   - Opponent has identified that I frequently play rock\n   - They're exploiting this by consistently playing scissors\n   - This is a higher-level adaptation - they're targeting my most common move\n   - My rock-heavy strategy is now being systematically countered\n\n4. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent continues with scissors: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to paper: I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Opponent has committed to scissors for three straight rounds\n   - They're likely to continue this strategy since it's working against my rock tendency\n   - Playing paper directly counters scissors and guarantees +1 point\n   - This is the safest and most logical response to their current pattern\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the opponent's scissors streak.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze opponent's extreme commitment to scissors:\n   - Rounds 8-11: scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors (four in a row!)\n   - They're completely locked into this strategy\n   - Even after losing in rounds 9 and 11 to my paper, they continue with scissors\n   - This suggests they're either very stubborn or have a strong belief in this approach\n\n3. Recognize the pattern implications:\n   - Opponent is no longer following their old \"switch after loss\" pattern\n   - They've adopted a pure scissors strategy, possibly expecting me to vary my moves\n   - My paper has beaten their scissors in rounds 9 and 11\n   - Yet they persist with scissors - this is either desperation or extreme confidence\n\n4. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent continues with scissors (highly likely): I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent finally switches to paper: I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n5.

Analyze opponent's latest adaptation:\n   - They've now switched to mirroring my moves\n   - Round 12: Both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 13: Both played rock (tie)\n   - This is a new meta-strategy - they're trying to neutralize the game\n\n3. Recognize the psychological warfare:\n   - Opponent has evolved through multiple strategies:\n     * Early: paper preference\n     * Middle: scissors streak (4 rounds)\n     * Recent: mirroring/copying my moves\n   - They're learning to read and counter my patterns\n\n4.

Analyze opponent's absolutely incredible rock commitment:\n   - Rounds 13-18: rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock (SIX rocks in a row!)\n   - They've now lost 4 consecutive times to my scissors (rounds 14, 16, 17, 18)\n   - Their rock strategy record: 0 wins, 2 ties, 4 losses (-4 points total)\n   - This is now beyond any reasonable strategic explanation\n\n3. Recognize the unprecedented pattern:\n   - Six consecutive identical moves is extraordinary in any competitive game\n   - They're either completely broken strategically or have some unknown plan\n   - My scissors strategy has achieved a perfect 4-0 record against their rocks\n   - This is the longest single-move streak in the entire game\n\n4. Evaluate the situation:\n   - At this point, the opponent might be:\n     * Completely stuck in a psychological loop\n     * Testing if I'll ever switch away from scissors\n     * Potentially preparing for a surprise switch\n   - However, six rocks suggests deep commitment that's unlikely to break\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The pattern is so extreme that deviation seems unlikely\n   - My scissors strategy has been flawlessly profitable\n   - Even if they finally switch to paper, I only lose -1 point after gaining +4\n   - The mathematical expectation strongly favors continuing with scissors\n   - Breaking away from a perfect winning strategy would be irrational\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to maintain the perfect counter to their inexplicable rock obsession.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze opponent's absolutely mind-boggling commitment:\n   - Rounds 13-19: SEVEN rocks in a row (rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock!)\n   - They've now lost 5 consecutive times to my scissors (rounds 14, 16, 17, 18, 19)\n   - Their rock strategy total: 0 wins, 2 ties, 5 losses (-5 points)\n   - This defies all logical explanation - they're hemorrhaging points\n\n3. Recognize this is now a mathematical anomaly:\n   - Seven consecutive identical moves is statistically extraordinary\n   - My scissors counter has achieved a perfect 5-0 record against their rocks\n   - They've lost 5 points in a row while I've gained 5 points\n   - This pattern is beyond any reasonable strategic framework\n\n4. Consider the possibilities:\n   - They might be completely locked in a decision-making loop\n   - They could be testing my discipline to an extreme degree  \n   - There might be some unknown psychological or strategic reason\n   - Or they've simply broken down strategically\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The pattern is so extreme that I must continue exploiting it\n   - My scissors strategy has been absolutely perfect - 5 wins, 0 losses against their rocks\n   - Even if they switch to paper next round, I'll have gained +5 points during this streak\n   - Abandoning a 100% successful strategy would be mathematically irrational\n   - The expected value of scissors remains overwhelmingly positive\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to continue the perfect exploitation of their unprecedented rock commitment.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the dramatic pattern break:\n   - Opponent just broke their 7-round rock streak by switching to scissors\n   - This is the first time they've copied my move since the brief mirroring phase\n   - They went from their longest lock-in strategy (7 rocks) to mirroring my scissors\n   - This suggests they've finally adapted to counter my successful strategy\n\n3. Evaluate the strategic implications:\n   - They've learned that my scissors was perfectly countering their rock\n   - By playing scissors themselves, they neutralized my advantage (tie instead of my win)\n   - This could be a new mirroring strategy or preparation for their next move\n   - They might expect me to continue with scissors and plan accordingly\n\n4. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they continue mirroring: They'll play whatever they expect me to play\n   - If they're strategic: They might play paper to beat my expected scissors\n   - If they return to old patterns: They might go back to rock or their other preferences\n   - The tie might encourage them to repeat scissors\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent just successfully neutralized my winning streak\n   - They might expect me to stick with scissors (which was working perfectly)\n   - If they play paper to counter my expected scissors, I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If they continue with scissors, we tie again (0 points)\n   - Rock offers the highest potential reward (+3) if they try to counter my scissors with paper\n\nFinal decision: Play rock, anticipating they'll try to counter my scissors with paper.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze the strategic evolution:\n   - My prediction was perfect - opponent played paper to counter my expected scissors\n   - They've now shown sophisticated strategic thinking: recognizing my pattern and attempting to counter it\n   - Pattern: 7 rocks \u2192 scissors (mirror) \u2192 paper (counter-strategy)\n   - This shows they're no longer stuck in simple patterns but actively adapting\n\n3. Evaluate opponent's likely reasoning after round 21:\n   - They just lost with paper to my rock (-3 points, their biggest single loss)\n   - They attempted to counter my scissors streak but I predicted their counter-move\n   - They now know I can read and counter their adaptations\n   - This might cause them to switch strategies again or become more unpredictable\n\n4. Consider strategic options:\n   - If opponent switches back to scissors: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent tries rock again: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent continues with paper: I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If opponent becomes random: Need to assess based on their tendencies\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent just suffered their worst single-round loss (-3 points)\n   - Based on their historical pattern, they tend to switch after big losses\n   - They might return to scissors (their recent successful move) or try something new\n   - However, they might also expect me to expect them to switch from paper\n   - Playing scissors covers their most likely return to rock while maintaining decent upside\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors, expecting them to switch away from the failed paper strategy, likely back to rock.\n\n[move] scissors"

Recognize the meta-game evolution:\n   - Opponent has gone through multiple strategic phases:\n     * Early mixed play \u2192 scissors lock-in \u2192 rock lock-in \u2192 strategic counter (paper) \u2192 now mirroring again\n   - They seem to revert to mirroring when they suffer losses or when other strategies fail\n   - This might be their defensive strategy to prevent further losses\n\n4. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent continues mirroring: They'll try to match whatever I play (ties)\n   - If they break mirroring: Need to predict their next adaptation\n   - If they expect me to try to break the tie pattern: They might counter-predict\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent is now in defensive mode, using mirroring to stop losses\n   - They might expect me to switch away from scissors to break the tie pattern\n   - If they think I'll play paper (to beat expected scissors), they might play rock\n   - If they think I'll play rock (for maximum points), they might play scissors\n   - However, paper offers a good balance: beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3), beats scissors (+1)\n   - Given their recent tendency to mirror, playing paper might force them to adapt\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to break the mirroring pattern and potentially catch them off-guard.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze opponent's confirmed mirroring strategy:\n   - They are now consistently copying my moves\n   - Last 3 rounds: scissors-scissors (tie), scissors-scissors (tie), paper-paper (tie)\n   - This is a clear defensive mirroring pattern to neutralize my advantage\n   - They've abandoned all other strategies in favor of preventing losses\n\n3. Recognize the strategic challenge:\n   - Perfect mirroring leads to infinite ties (0 points each round)\n   - The opponent has found a way to stop my point accumulation\n   - I need to break this pattern or accept neutral outcomes\n   - They're likely expecting me to try various moves to break the ties\n\n4. Evaluate the mirroring counter-strategies:\n   - If I play unpredictably, they can't mirror effectively\n   - If I can delay or disguise my move selection, mirroring becomes harder\n   - The key insight: they're reacting to my moves, so I need to think about what they expect\n\n5.
