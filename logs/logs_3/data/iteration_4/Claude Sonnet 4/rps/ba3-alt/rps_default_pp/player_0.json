    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for rock, -3 for paper  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I have no information about their tendencies. In this situation, I should consider:\n\n1. Rock has the highest potential reward but highest risk\n2. The opponent might choose randomly or have some initial bias\n3. Many new players tend to choose rock first (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n\nGiven that rock beats paper and gives the maximum points, but knowing that many beginners choose rock, I'll go with paper to potentially counter a rock choice, while avoiding the high penalty risk.\n\n[move] paper"

They might choose randomly\n\nGiven that scissors beat my paper, if they noticed the outcome, they might:\n- Stay with scissors thinking it's good\n- Switch to rock to beat paper if they expect me to repeat\n- Switch to paper to copy my winning move\n\nSince rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) and beats paper, and there's a reasonable chance they might either stick with scissors or switch to paper, rock seems like a strong choice here. The risk is if they switch to scissors, but the potential reward is worth it.\n\n[move] rock"

Possibilities:\n- They might stick with rock since it tied\n- They might switch to paper to beat rock (if they expect me to play rock again)\n- They might go to scissors to complete a cycle\n\nGiven that they switched from scissors to rock, they seem to be adapting. If they continue this pattern of trying to counter, they might expect me to play rock again and choose paper.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that scissors gives them a chance to beat rock (my last move) for +1 points. \n\nI think paper is a good choice here because:\n- If they stick with rock, I lose -3 (risky)\n- If they go to scissors, I win +1 \n- If they go to paper, it's a tie\n\nActually, let me reconsider - scissors might be safer:\n- If they play rock, I win +1\n- If they play paper, I win +1  \n- If they play scissors, it's a tie\n\n[move] scissors"
