The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, they might choose randomly or go with common intuitive choices.\n\nMany new players tend to start with rock (it's often the first choice people think of) or scissors. If they choose rock, I lose big with paper. If they choose scissors, I win small with rock. If they choose paper, I win big with rock.\n\nGiven that rock offers the highest potential reward and new players often don't start with paper, I'll take the calculated risk.\n\n[move] Rock"

They might be thinking similarly about maximizing points, or they could be following a pattern.\n\nSince we both chose rock in the first round, I need to consider what they might do next. Some possibilities:\n- They stick with rock since it has the highest reward potential\n- They switch to paper, expecting me to play rock again\n- They switch to scissors for variety\n\nIf they stick with rock, we tie again (0 points).\nIf they switch to paper, I lose big (-3 points) with rock, but win small (+1) with scissors.\nIf they switch to scissors, I win big (+3) with rock, tie (0) with scissors, or lose small (-1) with paper.\n\nGiven that rock still offers the highest potential reward and many players don't immediately switch to the counter-move (paper) after a tie, I'll stick with my high-reward strategy for now.\n\n[move] Rock"
