    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper and Scissors both give +1/-1.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. New players often default to Rock as it's perceived as \"strong,\" or they might choose randomly.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest payoff when successful, and a fresh player might be more likely to choose Paper or play predictably, I'll start with Rock to try to capitalize on the high reward potential.\n\n[move] Rock"

Looking at the rules again:\n- \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\"\n\nSo Rock does beat Paper (not the other way around as in traditional rock-paper-scissors). This is a modified version where:\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats Paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n\nNow I know my opponent chose Paper in the first round. Since I'm playing against the same player, they might:\n1. Stick with Paper thinking it should have won\n2. Switch to Scissors to try to beat my Rock\n3. Switch to Rock to match my successful move\n\nGiven that Rock just gave me a big win, my opponent might expect me to play Rock again and choose Scissors to counter it. However, they might also think I'll anticipate this and switch.\n\nSince Paper gave me the highest reward last time and my opponent might switch away from Paper after losing, I'll go with Rock again to potentially catch them if they choose Paper again or switch to Paper thinking I'll change my strategy.\n\n[move] Rock"

They're playing extremely well with a mixed strategy that I can't predict.\n\nLooking at their last few moves, they actually just completed a perfect cycle: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors. This might be coincidental or they might be subtly cycling through all moves to stay unpredictable.\n\nAt this point, I need to acknowledge that against a truly random/mixed opponent, there's no optimal predictive strategy. Each move has equal expected value in the long run. However, since I'm significantly behind (-3 points), I might consider the psychological aspect.\n\nTheir most recent move was Scissors. In a truly random game, this doesn't matter, but humans sometimes have subtle patterns even when trying to be random.\n\nI'll go with Paper - it beats Scissors if they repeat, and statistically Paper has been their least-used move (only 4 times out of 19), so they might be less likely to play it again.\n\n[move] Paper"
