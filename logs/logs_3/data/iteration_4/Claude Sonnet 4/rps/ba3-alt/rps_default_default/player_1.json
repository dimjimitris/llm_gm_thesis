    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My opponent chose rock as predicted by their strong scissors \u2192 rock pattern.\n\nUpdated score tracking:\n- Previous total: +19 points\n- This round: +1 point\n- Current total: +20 points\n\nThey just played rock in round 23. Looking at their pattern after rock:\n- Rock (R3) \u2192 Scissors (R4)\n- Rock (R7) \u2192 Paper (R8)\n- Rock (R10) \u2192 Rock (R11)\n- Rock (R11) \u2192 Paper (R12)\n- Rock (R14) \u2192 Paper (R15)\n- Rock (R17) \u2192 Paper (R18)\n- Rock (R20) \u2192 Paper (R21)\n- Rock (R23) \u2192 ?\n\n**After rock**: Paper appears 5 times, Scissors once, Rock once out of 7 instances.\nPaper is chosen 5/7 times (71%) after rock - this pattern has strengthened!\n\nThe key patterns remain:\n- **Paper \u2192 Scissors**: 10/10 (100% - absolutely perfect)\n- **Scissors \u2192 Rock**: 7/8 (87% - very strong)\n- **Rock \u2192 Paper**: 5/7 (71% - strong and improving)\n\nIf they choose paper (most likely at 71%), I should choose rock for +3.\nIf they choose scissors, I should choose paper for +1.\nIf they choose rock again, it's a tie.\n\nBased on the 71% probability of paper after rock, I'll go with rock for the potential +3 payoff.\n\n[move] rock"
