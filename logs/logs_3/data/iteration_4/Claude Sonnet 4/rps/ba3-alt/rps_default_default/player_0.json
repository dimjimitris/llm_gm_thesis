    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for rock, -3 for paper  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with their instinct. Many people intuitively choose rock first (it's often the default choice), so playing paper could be a good counter-strategy to capitalize on the high-value rock vs paper matchup.\n\n[move] paper"

The hint says I won with paper against scissors and scored 1 point, but according to the game description, \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points.\" This means paper should beat scissors, not the other way around.\n\nLet me re-read: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" So paper does beat scissors, which matches the result.\n\nNow for the next round, I need to think about what my opponent might do. They just lost with scissors against my paper. They might:\n1. Switch to rock (which would beat my paper for +3/-3)\n2. Try paper themselves \n3. Stick with scissors again\n\nGiven that rock has the highest payoff differential (+3/-3), and my opponent just lost, they might go for rock to try to get those 3 points. If they do choose rock, I should choose scissors to beat it for +1 point.\n\nHowever, there's also a chance they might think I'll stick with paper since it just won, so they could choose rock to counter that.\n\nI'll go with scissors to counter a potential rock play, as it seems like a reasonable adaptation after they just lost.\n\n[move] scissors"
