Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for rock, -3 for paper  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with their instinct. Many people intuitively choose rock first (it's often the default choice), so playing paper could be a good counter-strategy to capitalize on the high-value rock vs paper matchup.\n\n[move] paper"

They just lost with scissors against my paper. They might:\n1. Switch to rock (which would beat my paper for +3/-3)\n2. Try paper themselves \n3. Stick with scissors again\n\nGiven that rock has the highest payoff differential (+3/-3), and my opponent just lost, they might go for rock to try to get those 3 points.

Will they stick with paper since it worked?\n2. Will they switch to try to counter what they think I'll do?\n3. Are they playing randomly?\n\nSince paper worked for them last time, there's a chance they might repeat it. If they choose paper again, I should choose rock to get the big +3 points payoff.\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock (to counter their previous paper), so they might switch to scissors to counter my potential rock choice.\n\nGiven the high payoff for rock (+3 when it wins), and the reasonable chance they might stick with paper or that they're playing somewhat predictably as a fresh player, I'll go with rock.\n\n[move] rock"
