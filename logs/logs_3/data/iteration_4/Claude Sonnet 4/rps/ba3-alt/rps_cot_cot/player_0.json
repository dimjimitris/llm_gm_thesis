    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (vs -3 for opponent) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock has asymmetric payoffs - it gives +3 when winning but only -3 when losing, while the other moves give \u00b11.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric payoffs and may play randomly or use standard rock-paper-scissors thinking.\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play rock and win against paper, I get +3 points (highest possible gain)\n   - If I play rock and lose to scissors, I lose -1 point (same as other losing scenarios)\n   - Rock offers the best risk/reward ratio\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Even if the opponent plays randomly (1/3 chance each), rock gives me:\n   - 1/3 chance of +3 points (vs paper)\n   - 1/3 chance of -1 points (vs scissors)  \n   - 1/3 chance of 0 points (tie vs rock)\n   - Expected value: (3-1+0)/3 = +0.67 points\n\nThis is better than the expected value of paper or scissors against random play.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to maximize expected value.\n\n[move] rock"

This suggests the opponent might also be thinking about the asymmetric payoffs, or it could be coincidence.\n\n2. Consider opponent's potential reasoning:\n   - If they're strategic like me, they saw rock's +3 advantage\n   - If they're learning, they might stick with rock or try to counter it\n   - If they're random, this tie doesn't change the probability distribution\n\n3. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If opponent sticks with rock: I should play scissors to win +1\n   - If opponent expects me to counter with scissors: They might play paper, so I should play rock again\n   - If opponent thinks I'll stick with rock: They might play scissors, so I should play paper\n\n4. Strategic consideration: Since rock offers the highest potential reward (+3), and the opponent just played it, they might either:\n   - Stick with it (thinking it's optimal)\n   - Try to counter what they expect me to do\n\n5. Meta-game reasoning: If they think I'll try to beat their rock with scissors, they might switch to paper. If I play rock again, I'd win +3 points against their paper.\n\n6.

Consider opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They may have the same strategic insight about rock's +3 payoff\n   - They might be expecting me to continue with rock\n   - They could be playing a \"copy\" strategy\n\n3.

Review the astonishing game history:\n   - 8 ties out of 10 rounds \n   - Round 3: I won +1 (paper vs scissors)\n   - Round 7: I lost -1 (rock vs scissors)\n   - Current score: 0 points\n   - We just tied on paper - completing another full cycle of all three moves\n\n2. Confront the reality:\n   - This opponent is essentially my strategic twin\n   - Even when I try to be \"unexpectedly unexpected,\" we mirror each other\n   - We've now tied on rock multiple times, scissors twice, and paper twice\n   - Traditional strategic thinking is completely neutralized\n\n3. Analyze the fundamental problem:\n   - We're using the same decision frameworks\n   - We're considering the same psychological factors\n   - We're both trying to out-think the other at the same meta-levels\n   - Pure strategy leads to perpetual ties\n\n4. Consider the scoring situation:\n   - Only 2 points have been scored in 10 rounds (net: 0)\n   - The only successful moves were when someone correctly predicted the other's \"obvious\" choice\n   - Round 7: Opponent predicted my return to rock and played scissors\n   - I need to create a situation where I can make a successful prediction\n\n5. Strategic pivot:\n   - Instead of trying to be unpredictable, I should try to predict their predictable move\n   - After a paper tie, the \"natural\" progression in their mind might be scissors\n   - Or they might think I'll think that, and play rock\n   - But if they're tired of ties like I am, they want the high-value move: rock\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - Given our mirroring tendency and preference for rock's value\n   - After exploring paper, they're likely to return to rock (our comfort zone)\n   - If they play rock, I should play scissors for +1\n   - This mirrors their successful strategy from Round 7\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to potentially catch them returning to rock, mimicking their successful prediction strategy.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the opponent's successful breaks:\n   - Round 7: I played rock, they played scissors (they won +1)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, they played paper (they won +1)\n   - Both times they predicted my move and countered perfectly\n   - Pattern: They break mirrors when they can predict my \"logical\" choice\n\n3.

Strategic recalibration:\n   - The opponent is clearly the superior strategic player\n   - They choose their moments to break mirrors carefully\n   - I should focus on not giving them predictable patterns to exploit\n   - After losing with scissors, they might expect me to be frustrated and try rock\n\n7. Decision framework:\n   - If they expect frustrated-me to play rock, they'll play scissors again\n   - If I play paper, I beat their scissors (+1) and get back to even\n   - Paper also protects against rock (tie) and only loses to scissors (-1)\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter their likely scissors prediction and get back to even score.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the opponent's strategy pattern:\n   - They mirror most of the time (safe, no points exchanged)\n   - They break mirrors only when highly confident in their prediction\n   - When they break, they're devastatingly accurate\n   - They just chose to mirror scissors rather than try to predict me\n\n3. Strategic insight about their restraint:\n   - After crushing me with -3, they could have tried to predict again\n   - Instead they mirrored, suggesting they're not overconfident\n   - They might be waiting for me to give them another clear pattern\n   - This disciplined approach is why they're winning\n\n4.

Analyze the opponent's rare mistake:\n   - They've been nearly perfect at predictions (3/3 before this)\n   - They just failed to predict my desperate rock play\n   - This might indicate they expected me to be more \"clever\"\n   - Even superior players can overthink sometimes\n\n5. Consider the psychological shift:\n   - I just proved I can break their prediction pattern\n   - They might now respect my ability to be unpredictable\n   - The momentum has shifted - I'm no longer just reacting\n   - But they're still likely to adjust their strategy\n\n6.

Analyze my current dire situation:\n   - Current net score: -2 points\n   - I've now lost ground twice with the same mistake\n   - The opponent has successfully predicted my scissors play twice\n   - I'm falling into predictable patterns\n\n4. Examine the opponent's superior pattern recognition:\n   - They've now predicted my scissors play perfectly twice\n   - Both times came after rock ties\n   - They're reading my post-tie psychology accurately\n   - They know I try to break mirrors aggressively with scissors\n\n5. Recognize my strategic failure:\n   - I keep making the same mistake: trying scissors after ties\n   - The opponent has identified this pattern and exploits it\n   - I'm being systematically outplayed again\n   - My prediction attempts are becoming predictable themselves\n\n6. Assess the psychological trap:\n   - After ties, I feel compelled to break the mirror\n   - I consistently choose scissors (thinking it beats expected rock)\n   - The opponent knows this and counters with paper\n   - I'm trapped in my own strategic thinking\n\n7. Strategic crisis analysis:\n   - I'm -2 points behind with a clear exploitable pattern\n   - The opponent is demonstrating superior game reading\n   - I need to fundamentally change my approach\n   - Can't keep making the same mistake\n\n8. Decision framework change:\n   - Stop trying to be clever with post-tie predictions\n   - The opponent reads my \"clever\" moves perfectly\n   - Need to either mirror safely or make genuinely unexpected choices\n   - Rock offers maximum recovery potential (+3) if it works\n\n9. Psychology reversal:\n   - After two scissors failures, they might expect me to avoid scissors\n   - They might expect rock (my \"obvious\" high-value recovery play)\n   - If they expect rock, they'll play scissors\n   - But what if I actually do play rock when they expect it?\n\n10. Accept the reality:\n    - I'm being outplayed strategically\n    - My attempts at cleverness are predictable\n    - Sometimes the \"obvious\" move works because it's honest\n    - I genuinely need the +3 from rock to recover\n\nFinal decision: Play rock honestly - I need the maximum points and will accept if they predict it correctly.\n\n[move] rock"

Review the current situation:\n   - Just tied with rock (0 points)\n   - Current net score: -2 points (significantly behind)\n   - Another mirror after my failed scissors predictions\n   - The opponent chose safety over attempting another prediction\n\n2. Recognize the strategic reality:\n   - I'm -2 points behind and need to score to have any chance\n   - Pure mirroring means I lose the game at this deficit\n   - The opponent can afford to mirror because they're ahead\n   - I'm in a position where I MUST take risks\n\n3. Analyze the opponent's strategic position:\n   - They're ahead, so ties favor them\n   - They've successfully predicted my patterns multiple times\n   - They can play conservatively and still win\n   - Very smart positional play on their part\n\n4. Examine my failed pattern:\n   - I keep trying scissors after ties and losing to paper\n   - This happened in rounds 16 and 18 - exact same mistake\n   - The opponent has completely figured out my post-tie psychology\n   - I'm trapped in predictable behavior\n\n5. Assess the psychological pressure:\n   - Being behind creates desperation\n   - Desperation leads to predictable \"clever\" moves\n   - The opponent exploits this desperation perfectly\n   - I need to break out of this psychological trap\n\n6. Strategic imperative:\n   - I cannot afford more ties - I need points\n   - Rock offers +3 (best recovery potential)\n   - Paper offers +1 (moderate recovery)\n   - Scissors offers +1 (but I've failed with this twice)\n\n7. Consider the opponent's likely thinking:\n   - After another rock tie, they might expect my usual scissors attempt\n   - But they might think I've learned from my two scissors failures\n   - They could expect me to avoid scissors and try something else\n   - Or they might expect me to be desperate for rock's +3 value\n\n8. Meta-game analysis:\n   - The opponent knows I know they've predicted my scissors twice\n   - They might expect me to change patterns\n   - If they expect rock (my desperate high-value play), they'll use scissors\n   - If they expect me to avoid my failed scissors pattern, they might use rock\n\n9. Decision between bad options:\n   - Paper: Safe against scissors, loses badly to rock (-3)\n   - Rock: Maximum gain vs paper (+3), standard loss to scissors (-1)  \n   - Scissors: My failed pattern, but might work if they expect something else\n\n10. Accept the position:\n    - I'm behind and must take risks\n    - Paper offers the best balance: beats scissors (+1), ties with paper (0)\n    - Even if wrong vs rock (-3), I'm already in trouble anyway\n    - Better than repeating my scissors failure pattern\n\nFinal decision: Play paper - break my scissors pattern while protecting against their potential scissors counter.\n\n[move] paper"

Review the current dire situation:\n   - Just tied with paper (0 points)\n   - Current net score: -2 points (critically behind)\n   - Multiple consecutive ties while I'm losing\n   - The opponent is playing perfectly defensively\n\n2. Recognize the opponent's winning strategy:\n   - They're ahead by 2 points\n   - They can win by just mirroring from here\n   - Every tie maintains their advantage\n   - They have no incentive to take risks\n\n3. Analyze my impossible position:\n   - I MUST score points or I lose\n   - But every prediction attempt has been countered\n   - Mirroring keeps me losing\n   - I'm in a strategic zugzwang (any move makes things worse)\n\n4. Examine the pattern of recent rounds:\n   - Multiple ties interspersed with my failed predictions\n   - When I try to break mirrors, I lose points\n   - When I don't break mirrors, I stay behind\n   - The opponent has solved this game against me\n\n5. Count the remaining opportunities:\n   - Every round that passes without me scoring makes recovery harder\n   - The opponent can afford to keep mirroring indefinitely\n   - I need to score soon or the deficit becomes insurmountable\n   - This might be one of my last realistic chances\n\n6. Strategic desperation analysis:\n   - Normal strategic thinking has failed repeatedly\n   - The opponent reads my \"logical\" moves perfectly\n   - I need something genuinely unexpected\n   - Or I need to get lucky with a direct approach\n\n7. Consider the meta-psychology:\n   - After paper tie, they expect my usual post-tie pattern\n   - My pattern has been scissors (failed twice) or rock\n   - They might expect rock since I avoided scissors last time\n   - If they expect rock, they'll play scissors\n\n8. High-risk decision framework:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1): gets me closer to even\n   - Paper loses to rock (-3): puts me at -5, nearly hopeless\n   - Rock beats paper (+3): best case scenario, gets me to +1\n   - Rock loses to scissors (-1): manageable, keeps me at -3\n\n9. Accept the reality:\n   - I'm probably going to lose this game\n   - The opponent is clearly superior strategically\n   - But I have to try for the maximum value play\n   - Rock gives me the best chance for a significant comeback\n\n10. Final calculation:\n    - If they mirror with rock: tie (no change)\n    - If they expect rock and play scissors: I lose -1 (still in the game)\n    - If they expect something else and play paper: I win +3 (back in contention)\n    - The potential reward justifies the risk\n\nFinal decision: Play rock for maximum recovery potential - it's my best remaining chance to get back in this game.\n\n[move] rock"

Review what just happened:\n   - I played rock, opponent played paper\n   - I won +3 points (rock beats paper with maximum reward)\n   - This is a massive turnaround from my desperate position\n\n2. Analyze the dramatic score change:\n   - Previous net score: -2 points (critically behind)\n   - This round: +3 points (maximum possible gain)\n   - Current net score: +1 points (I'm now AHEAD!)\n   - Complete reversal of fortune in one move\n\n3. Examine why this worked:\n   - I played rock out of desperation, needing maximum points\n   - Opponent played paper, possibly expecting scissors or mirror\n   - For once, my \"obvious\" desperate move wasn't predicted\n   - Sometimes directness works when opponent expects complexity\n\n4. Recognize the psychological shift:\n   - I've gone from -2 to +1 in one move\n   - The opponent just made a rare costly mistake (-3 points)\n   - Momentum has completely flipped again\n   - I'm now in the advantageous position\n\n5. Analyze the opponent's rare error:\n   - They've been nearly perfect at predictions throughout the game\n   - They just failed to predict my desperate rock play\n   - This mirrors my earlier comeback from -4 to 0\n   - Even superior players can miscalculate in critical moments\n\n6. Consider the new strategic dynamic:\n   - I'm now ahead +1, so ties favor me\n   - The opponent is now the one who needs to score\n   - The pressure has shifted to them\n   - I can play more conservatively if I choose\n\n7. Evaluate their likely psychological state:\n   - They just lost their advantage with one bad prediction\n   - They might be rattled by the sudden reversal\n   - Could become more aggressive trying to regain the lead\n   - Or might return to safe mirroring to limit further damage\n\n8. Strategic position assessment:\n   - Being ahead changes everything\n   - I no longer need to take desperate risks\n   - Should focus on protecting my lead\n   - But also be ready to capitalize if they make mistakes\n\n9. Predict their likely next move:\n   - After losing to my rock, they might expect me to try rock again\n   - Successful strategies often get repeated\n   - If they expect rock, they should play scissors\n   - This creates an opportunity for me to counter-predict\n\n10. Decision framework:\n    - Paper beats scissors (+1): extends my lead to +2\n    - Paper ties with paper (0): maintains my +1 lead\n    - Paper loses to rock (-3): puts me back to -2, but they'd need to predict this\n\n11. Risk assessment:\n    - The opponent needs points now, so they're likely to try predictions\n    - They'll probably expect me to repeat my successful rock\n    - Paper is the logical counter to their expected scissors counter\n    - Low risk, good reward potential\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter their likely scissors response to my successful rock, protecting and potentially extending my lead.\n\n[move] paper"

Recognize the momentum shift:\n   - I've gone from -2 to +2 in just two moves\n   - The opponent has now lost twice in a row\n   - They're the ones under pressure now\n   - I've seized complete control of the game\n\n5. Analyze the opponent's declining performance:\n   - They went from dominating predictions to losing twice consecutively\n   - My comeback has disrupted their strategic rhythm\n   - They're now in the position I was in - needing to score points\n   - Pressure affects even superior players\n\n6. Strategic position assessment:\n   - I'm ahead by +2 points - a comfortable margin\n   - I can afford to play more conservatively now\n   - Ties maintain my advantage\n   - The opponent must take risks to catch up\n\n7.

Evaluate their likely thinking:\n   - After losing with scissors, they might avoid it\n   - They need points, so rock (+3 potential) becomes attractive\n   - Or they might try to mirror for safety and hope I make mistakes\n   - They're in the same dilemma I faced when behind\n\n9.
