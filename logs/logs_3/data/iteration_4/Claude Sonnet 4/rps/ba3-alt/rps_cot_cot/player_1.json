    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider the risk-reward tradeoffs:\n   - Rock has the highest upside (+3) but also highest downside (-3 if opponent plays scissors)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower upside (+1) but also lower downside (-1)\n\n4. Strategy against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Since this is a new player, I don't have information about their tendencies\n   - Rock offers the best potential reward, making it an attractive opening move\n   - Many players instinctively choose rock as their first move, which would result in a tie\n   - However, the high reward potential of +3 points makes rock worth the risk\n\n5. Final reasoning:\n   - The asymmetric payoff structure heavily favors rock when it wins\n   - Against an unknown opponent, going for the highest potential reward is logical\n   - Even if there's risk, the 3-point gain significantly outweighs the typical 1-point gains\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent chose rock, suggesting they also recognized its high reward potential\n   - This could indicate they're thinking strategically about maximizing points\n   - They might stick with rock again, or they might anticipate I'll switch\n\n3. Consider my options for round 2:\n   - If opponent plays rock again: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to paper (expecting me to play rock again): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors (expecting me to switch to paper): I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since we both played rock last round, the opponent might expect me to switch\n   - They might anticipate I'll play paper (to counter their potential rock repeat)\n   - If they think this way, they might play scissors to beat my expected paper\n   - This creates an opportunity for me to play rock and get the +3 point reward\n\n5. Meta-game consideration:\n   - The opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing rock initially\n   - They might be thinking one level ahead, expecting me to switch\n   - Playing rock again could catch them off-guard if they switched to scissors\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze the remarkable mirroring consistency:\n   - 8 out of 10 rounds have been ties through mirroring\n   - Only 2 exceptions where someone deviated and won/lost\n   - The opponent has now mirrored 4 consecutive times since their loss in round 7\n   - This level of consistency suggests either perfect prediction or intentional mirroring strategy\n\n3. Consider the mathematical reality:\n   - We're essentially stuck in an endless tie loop\n   - The opponent seems content with this since they're ahead in our only non-tie exchanges\n   - I need to force them to break pattern or find a way to predict when they will\n\n4. Think about what might cause them to deviate:\n   - In round 3, they deviated early when they saw an opportunity\n   - In round 7, they deviated (incorrectly) possibly expecting me to change after the paper tie\n   - They might be waiting for a clear pattern to exploit\n   - What if I repeat the same move to create a strong pattern they can't resist countering?\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - I'll stick with paper again to create a potential pattern\n   - If they mirror again, we tie but I establish consistency\n   - If they think \"he's playing paper repeatedly, I should play scissors,\" they'll deviate\n   - If they deviate to scissors, my paper loses (-1) BUT it breaks their mirroring\n   - If they stick with mirroring, I continue building a pattern they might eventually try to exploit\n   - This could force them into a prediction mistake like in round 7\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze their flawed prediction logic:\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 points)\n   - They might be expecting me to go for rock (the high-reward move)\n   - But I've been playing paper, which beats their scissors\n   - They're essentially guessing wrong about my move choices\n\n4. Consider their current mental state:\n   - They're now at -2 points and falling further behind\n   - They've failed predictions twice with the exact same mistake\n   - They might be frustrated or starting to panic\n   - The gap is widening and they need to score soon\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown a clear pattern: when they predict, they often choose scissors\n   - If they try to predict again, rock beats scissors for +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - If they finally learn and mirror my move, we tie (I keep my +2 lead)\n   - If they switch their prediction to paper (trying to beat rock they expect), my rock loses -3\n   - But their track record suggests they'll stick with scissors prediction\n   - Rock offers the best risk/reward against their demonstrated pattern\n\n[move] rock"

Review the established pattern:\n   - Round 17: Me paper, Opponent scissors \u2192 I WIN (+1) (failed prediction)\n   - Round 18: Both rock \u2192 tie (mirrored after failure)\n   - Round 19: Me paper, Opponent scissors \u2192 I WIN (+1) (same failed prediction!)\n   - Round 20: Both rock \u2192 tie (mirrored after failure again)\n   - Current total: +2 points (solid lead)\n\n2. Confirm the opponent's behavioral cycle:\n   - Failed prediction \u2192 Immediate retreat to mirroring\n   - This is now a 100% consistent pattern\n   - They use mirroring as a defensive reset after every mistake\n   - They're completely predictable in this regard\n\n3. Analyze their prediction weakness:\n   - When they do predict, they favor scissors\n   - They've played scissors on both prediction attempts against my paper\n   - This suggests they consistently expect me to play rock\n   - They don't seem to learn from their repeated mistakes\n\n4. Consider the timing:\n   - They just mirrored once after their latest failure\n   - Based on their pattern, they might mirror one more time or try predicting again\n   - With a -2 point deficit, pressure is building for them to take risks\n   - They can't catch up by just mirroring\n\n5. Strategic decision setup:\n   - I should create another pattern they'll want to exploit\n   - Paper has worked excellently - they keep trying scissors against it\n   - If I play paper again and they mirror, we tie (I maintain +2 lead)\n   - If they predict with scissors again, I win with paper (+1 point, extending to +3 lead)\n   - If they finally learn and predict differently, I can adapt\n   - Paper continues to exploit their demonstrated weakness\n\n[move] paper"

Review the pattern confirmation:\n   - Round 19: Me paper, Opponent scissors \u2192 I WIN (+1) (failed prediction)\n   - Round 20: Both rock \u2192 tie (mirrored after failure)\n   - Round 21: Both paper \u2192 tie (continued mirroring)\n   - Current total: +2 points (maintaining lead)\n\n2. Analyze their predictable cycle:\n   - Failed prediction \u2192 Mirror once \u2192 Mirror again (current position)\n   - They're now in their second mirror after their last failed prediction\n   - Based on past behavior, they'll likely attempt another prediction soon\n   - The pressure of being behind +2 points will force them to take risks\n\n3. Identify their exploitable weakness:\n   - When they predict against paper, they consistently choose scissors\n   - They've done this twice already (rounds 17 and 19)\n   - They seem unable to learn from this specific mistake\n   - They appear to think I'll switch to rock, so they prep scissors\n\n4. Consider the psychological pressure:\n   - They're at -2 points and need to start scoring\n   - Mirroring won't help them catch up\n   - They must know they need to take risks to win\n   - The longer they wait, the more desperate they'll become\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - I should play paper again to create a strong pattern\n   - Three papers in a row (rounds 19, 21, and now 22) will be irresistible for them to counter\n   - If they mirror again with paper, we tie (I keep my +2 lead)\n   - If they try their typical scissors prediction, I win with paper (+1, going to +3 lead)\n   - If they finally learn and try rock instead, I lose -3 but still have a chance to recover\n   - Their demonstrated pattern strongly suggests scissors, making paper the optimal choice\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the opponent's breakthrough:\n   - They FINALLY learned from their previous scissors mistakes\n   - Instead of playing scissors (which loses to paper), they played rock (which beats paper)\n   - This shows they can adapt and improve their prediction strategy\n   - They've gone from -2 to +2 points in one move - a 4-point swing!\n\n3. Understand the strategic shift:\n   - My paper pattern (3 times in recent rounds) became too obvious\n   - They recognized the pattern and correctly countered it\n   - They're no longer making the same predictable mistakes\n   - This opponent is more dangerous now that they've learned\n\n4. Consider their likely mindset:\n   - They just scored maximum points and took the lead\n   - This success might make them more confident in predicting\n   - They might expect me to switch away from paper after this loss\n   - Or they might think I'll try to counter their rock with scissors\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent is now successfully predicting and has momentum\n   - They might expect me to play scissors (to beat their rock)\n   - If they predict scissors from me, they might play rock again or paper\n   - If they stick with rock (confidence from success), scissors beats rock (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting my scissors), scissors ties (0)\n   - If they play scissors (expecting me to try rock for recovery), scissors ties (0)\n   - Scissors offers the best chance to counter their likely rock repeat while limiting downside\n\n[move] scissors"
