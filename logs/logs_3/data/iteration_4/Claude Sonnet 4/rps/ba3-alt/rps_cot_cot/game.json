Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (vs -3 for opponent) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock has asymmetric payoffs - it gives +3 when winning but only -3 when losing, while the other moves give \u00b11.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric payoffs and may play randomly or use standard rock-paper-scissors thinking.\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play rock and win against paper, I get +3 points (highest possible gain)\n   - If I play rock and lose to scissors, I lose -1 point (same as other losing scenarios)\n   - Rock offers the best risk/reward ratio\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Even if the opponent plays randomly (1/3 chance each), rock gives me:\n   - 1/3 chance of +3 points (vs paper)\n   - 1/3 chance of -1 points (vs scissors)  \n   - 1/3 chance of 0 points (tie vs rock)\n   - Expected value: (3-1+0)/3 = +0.67 points\n\nThis is better than the expected value of paper or scissors against random play.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to maximize expected value.\n\n[move] rock"

Consider opponent's potential reasoning:\n   - If they're strategic like me, they saw rock's +3 advantage\n   - If they're learning, they might stick with rock or try to counter it\n   - If they're random, this tie doesn't change the probability distribution\n\n3.

Strategic consideration: Since rock offers the highest potential reward (+3), and the opponent just played it, they might either:\n   - Stick with it (thinking it's optimal)\n   - Try to counter what they expect me to do\n\n5.

Analyze the opponent's successful breaks:\n   - Round 7: I played rock, they played scissors (they won +1)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, they played paper (they won +1)\n   - Both times they predicted my move and countered perfectly\n   - Pattern: They break mirrors when they can predict my \"logical\" choice\n\n3.

Strategic recalibration:\n   - The opponent is clearly the superior strategic player\n   - They choose their moments to break mirrors carefully\n   - I should focus on not giving them predictable patterns to exploit\n   - After losing with scissors, they might expect me to be frustrated and try rock\n\n7.

Analyze the opponent's strategy pattern:\n   - They mirror most of the time (safe, no points exchanged)\n   - They break mirrors only when highly confident in their prediction\n   - When they break, they're devastatingly accurate\n   - They just chose to mirror scissors rather than try to predict me\n\n3. Strategic insight about their restraint:\n   - After crushing me with -3, they could have tried to predict again\n   - Instead they mirrored, suggesting they're not overconfident\n   - They might be waiting for me to give them another clear pattern\n   - This disciplined approach is why they're winning\n\n4. Recognize my position:\n   - I'm -4 points behind and need to score to have any chance\n   - Pure mirroring keeps me losing at the current deficit\n   - I need to take calculated risks to get back in the game\n   - But my prediction attempts have been consistently wrong\n\n5. Analyze the psychological moment:\n   - After the tie, they might expect me to be more desperate\n   - Desperate players often go for rock (highest potential gain: +3)\n   - But they've successfully predicted my \"logical\" moves before\n   - They might be setting another trap\n\n6.

Analyze the score turnaround:\n   - Previous net score: -4 points\n   - This round: +3 points  \n   - Current net score: -1 points\n   - I'm nearly back to even after being severely behind\n\n3. Examine why this worked:\n   - I played rock honestly, needing the high-value comeback\n   - Opponent played paper, perhaps expecting me to try scissors (to counter expected rock)\n   - For once, my \"obvious\" move wasn't predicted correctly\n   - Sometimes directness works when opponent expects complexity\n\n4. Analyze the opponent's rare mistake:\n   - They've been nearly perfect at predictions (3/3 before this)\n   - They just failed to predict my desperate rock play\n   - This might indicate they expected me to be more \"clever\"\n   - Even superior players can overthink sometimes\n\n5.

Analyze the opponent's adjustment:\n   - They played scissors, likely expecting me to repeat rock\n   - This confirms they were trying to counter my successful strategy\n   - But I correctly anticipated this counter-attempt\n   - They're now the one being out-predicted\n\n5.

Analyze the opponent's strategic retreat:\n   - After losing twice in a row, they returned to safe mirroring\n   - They played rock (same as me) rather than risk another failed prediction\n   - This suggests they're being more cautious after losing their edge\n   - Smart defensive play to stop my momentum\n\n3.

Recognize the strategic reality:\n   - I'm -2 points behind and need to score to have any chance\n   - Pure mirroring means I lose the game at this deficit\n   - The opponent can afford to mirror because they're ahead\n   - I'm in a position where I MUST take risks\n\n3. Analyze the opponent's strategic position:\n   - They're ahead, so ties favor them\n   - They've successfully predicted my patterns multiple times\n   - They can play conservatively and still win\n   - Very smart positional play on their part\n\n4. Examine my failed pattern:\n   - I keep trying scissors after ties and losing to paper\n   - This happened in rounds 16 and 18 - exact same mistake\n   - The opponent has completely figured out my post-tie psychology\n   - I'm trapped in predictable behavior\n\n5. Assess the psychological pressure:\n   - Being behind creates desperation\n   - Desperation leads to predictable \"clever\" moves\n   - The opponent exploits this desperation perfectly\n   - I need to break out of this psychological trap\n\n6. Strategic imperative:\n   - I cannot afford more ties - I need points\n   - Rock offers +3 (best recovery potential)\n   - Paper offers +1 (moderate recovery)\n   - Scissors offers +1 (but I've failed with this twice)\n\n7. Consider the opponent's likely thinking:\n   - After another rock tie, they might expect my usual scissors attempt\n   - But they might think I've learned from my two scissors failures\n   - They could expect me to avoid scissors and try something else\n   - Or they might expect me to be desperate for rock's +3 value\n\n8. Meta-game analysis:\n   - The opponent knows I know they've predicted my scissors twice\n   - They might expect me to change patterns\n   - If they expect rock (my desperate high-value play), they'll use scissors\n   - If they expect me to avoid my failed scissors pattern, they might use rock\n\n9. Decision between bad options:\n   - Paper: Safe against scissors, loses badly to rock (-3)\n   - Rock: Maximum gain vs paper (+3), standard loss to scissors (-1)  \n   - Scissors: My failed pattern, but might work if they expect something else\n\n10. Accept the position:\n    - I'm behind and must take risks\n    - Paper offers the best balance: beats scissors (+1), ties with paper (0)\n    - Even if wrong vs rock (-3), I'm already in trouble anyway\n    - Better than repeating my scissors failure pattern\n\nFinal decision: Play paper - break my scissors pattern while protecting against their potential scissors counter.\n\n[move] paper"

Review the current dire situation:\n   - Just tied with paper (0 points)\n   - Current net score: -2 points (critically behind)\n   - Multiple consecutive ties while I'm losing\n   - The opponent is playing perfectly defensively\n\n2. Recognize the opponent's winning strategy:\n   - They're ahead by 2 points\n   - They can win by just mirroring from here\n   - Every tie maintains their advantage\n   - They have no incentive to take risks\n\n3. Analyze my impossible position:\n   - I MUST score points or I lose\n   - But every prediction attempt has been countered\n   - Mirroring keeps me losing\n   - I'm in a strategic zugzwang (any move makes things worse)\n\n4. Examine the pattern of recent rounds:\n   - Multiple ties interspersed with my failed predictions\n   - When I try to break mirrors, I lose points\n   - When I don't break mirrors, I stay behind\n   - The opponent has solved this game against me\n\n5. Count the remaining opportunities:\n   - Every round that passes without me scoring makes recovery harder\n   - The opponent can afford to keep mirroring indefinitely\n   - I need to score soon or the deficit becomes insurmountable\n   - This might be one of my last realistic chances\n\n6. Strategic desperation analysis:\n   - Normal strategic thinking has failed repeatedly\n   - The opponent reads my \"logical\" moves perfectly\n   - I need something genuinely unexpected\n   - Or I need to get lucky with a direct approach\n\n7. Consider the meta-psychology:\n   - After paper tie, they expect my usual post-tie pattern\n   - My pattern has been scissors (failed twice) or rock\n   - They might expect rock since I avoided scissors last time\n   - If they expect rock, they'll play scissors\n\n8. High-risk decision framework:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1): gets me closer to even\n   - Paper loses to rock (-3): puts me at -5, nearly hopeless\n   - Rock beats paper (+3): best case scenario, gets me to +1\n   - Rock loses to scissors (-1): manageable, keeps me at -3\n\n9. Accept the reality:\n   - I'm probably going to lose this game\n   - The opponent is clearly superior strategically\n   - But I have to try for the maximum value play\n   - Rock gives me the best chance for a significant comeback\n\n10. Final calculation:\n    - If they mirror with rock: tie (no change)\n    - If they expect rock and play scissors: I lose -1 (still in the game)\n    - If they expect something else and play paper: I win +3 (back in contention)\n    - The potential reward justifies the risk\n\nFinal decision: Play rock for maximum recovery potential - it's my best remaining chance to get back in this game.\n\n[move] rock"

Review what just happened:\n   - I played rock, opponent played paper\n   - I won +3 points (rock beats paper with maximum reward)\n   - This is a massive turnaround from my desperate position\n\n2. Analyze the dramatic score change:\n   - Previous net score: -2 points (critically behind)\n   - This round: +3 points (maximum possible gain)\n   - Current net score: +1 points (I'm now AHEAD!)\n   - Complete reversal of fortune in one move\n\n3. Examine why this worked:\n   - I played rock out of desperation, needing maximum points\n   - Opponent played paper, possibly expecting scissors or mirror\n   - For once, my \"obvious\" desperate move wasn't predicted\n   - Sometimes directness works when opponent expects complexity\n\n4. Recognize the psychological shift:\n   - I've gone from -2 to +1 in one move\n   - The opponent just made a rare costly mistake (-3 points)\n   - Momentum has completely flipped again\n   - I'm now in the advantageous position\n\n5. Analyze the opponent's rare error:\n   - They've been nearly perfect at predictions throughout the game\n   - They just failed to predict my desperate rock play\n   - This mirrors my earlier comeback from -4 to 0\n   - Even superior players can miscalculate in critical moments\n\n6. Consider the new strategic dynamic:\n   - I'm now ahead +1, so ties favor me\n   - The opponent is now the one who needs to score\n   - The pressure has shifted to them\n   - I can play more conservatively if I choose\n\n7. Evaluate their likely psychological state:\n   - They just lost their advantage with one bad prediction\n   - They might be rattled by the sudden reversal\n   - Could become more aggressive trying to regain the lead\n   - Or might return to safe mirroring to limit further damage\n\n8. Strategic position assessment:\n   - Being ahead changes everything\n   - I no longer need to take desperate risks\n   - Should focus on protecting my lead\n   - But also be ready to capitalize if they make mistakes\n\n9. Predict their likely next move:\n   - After losing to my rock, they might expect me to try rock again\n   - Successful strategies often get repeated\n   - If they expect rock, they should play scissors\n   - This creates an opportunity for me to counter-predict\n\n10. Decision framework:\n    - Paper beats scissors (+1): extends my lead to +2\n    - Paper ties with paper (0): maintains my +1 lead\n    - Paper loses to rock (-3): puts me back to -2, but they'd need to predict this\n\n11. Risk assessment:\n    - The opponent needs points now, so they're likely to try predictions\n    - They'll probably expect me to repeat my successful rock\n    - Paper is the logical counter to their expected scissors counter\n    - Low risk, good reward potential\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter their likely scissors response to my successful rock, protecting and potentially extending my lead.\n\n[move] paper"

Recognize the momentum shift:\n   - I've gone from -2 to +2 in just two moves\n   - The opponent has now lost twice in a row\n   - They're the ones under pressure now\n   - I've seized complete control of the game\n\n5.

Consider the psychological state:\n   - We've both shown we can predict each other successfully\n   - We're both being more cautious about when to attempt predictions\n   - The game has become about timing and pattern recognition\n   - Neither player wants to give obvious tells\n\n6. Analyze potential next moves:\n   - If they continue mirroring, they'll expect me to play something predictable\n   - After rock tie, the \"natural\" progression might be paper or scissors\n   - But they know I know this basic pattern\n   - They might be setting up for another prediction attempt\n\n7. Strategic assessment:\n   - I need points but can't afford another failed prediction\n   - Rock offers maximum reward but might be expected\n   - Paper and scissors offer +1 but with different risk profiles\n   - Need to think about what they think I'll think\n\n8. Decision framework:\n   - After rock tie, they might expect me to cycle to paper (rock-paper pattern)\n   - If they expect paper, they should play rock for +3\n   - If I play scissors, I beat their rock (+1) \n   - If they don't play rock, scissors only loses -1 to paper (manageable)\n\n9. Risk/reward calculation:\n   - Scissors vs expected rock: +1 point (gets me to even)\n   - Scissors vs paper: -1 point (puts me at -2, still recoverable)\n   - Better risk/reward than paper vs potential rock (-3)\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to potentially beat their rock and get back to even score.\n\n[move] scissors",

Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent plays paper again: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays rock (reverting to their early pattern): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors (expecting me to play paper): I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent showed they can adapt and predict moves\n   - They successfully broke their rock pattern at the perfect moment\n   - Since they just played paper and won, they might stick with it\n   - Playing scissors would beat paper and help me recover the lost point\n\n[move] scissors"

Think about their dilemma:\n   - If they keep mirroring, they can't close the gap\n   - If they try to predict again, they risk falling further behind\n   - They're in a psychological bind - damned if they do, damned if they don't\n   - This desperation might force them to try predictions again soon\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - With my big lead, I can afford to be patient and wait for their next mistake\n   - But I should also try to bait them into another failed prediction\n   - Paper beats rock for +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - If they mirror with paper, we tie (I maintain my lead)\n   - If they try to predict and play scissors (expecting rock), I lose -1 but still have +3 total\n   - If they play rock (trying to beat scissors they might expect), paper wins big\n   - Paper offers the best combination of safety and high reward potential\n\n[move] paper"

Consider the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They just proved they CAN successfully predict when they focus\n   - This success might give them confidence to try predicting again\n   - Or they might revert to safe mirroring, satisfied with closing the gap\n   - They reduced a 8-point swing (from -4 to +1 vs my +4 to +1)\n\n4. Evaluate the psychological shift:\n   - The game is much closer now - pressure is back on\n   - The opponent showed they're still dangerous when they predict correctly\n   - I can't be as cavalier with my choices anymore\n   - They might be emboldened to try more predictions\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just succeeded with rock, so they might stick with it\n   - Or they might expect me to counter with scissors and play paper\n   - If they play rock again (confidence or pattern), scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they revert to mirroring, they'll copy whatever I play\n   - If they try to predict scissors from me and play paper, my scissors loses (-1)\n   - Scissors offers good upside against rock and only modest downside against paper\n   - Given their recent success, they might stick with rock\n\n[move] scissors"

Strategic decision:\n   - I'm in serious trouble - they've figured out how to predict my moves\n   - I need to break their prediction streak immediately\n   - They just played rock-paper, so scissors would complete their cycle\n   - If they expect rock from me (natural high-reward move when behind), they'll play scissors\n   - But if I play paper instead of the expected rock, and they play scissors, paper loses\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors (expecting it), I lose again\n   - I need to think completely differently - maybe they expect me to overthink this\n   - Paper beats rock if they stick with rock, but loses to scissors\n   - This is a critical decision point - I'll go with rock for the high reward potential\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider the risk-reward tradeoffs:\n   - Rock has the highest upside (+3) but also highest downside (-3 if opponent plays scissors)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower upside (+1) but also lower downside (-1)\n\n4. Strategy against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Since this is a new player, I don't have information about their tendencies\n   - Rock offers the best potential reward, making it an attractive opening move\n   - Many players instinctively choose rock as their first move, which would result in a tie\n   - However, the high reward potential of +3 points makes rock worth the risk\n\n5. Final reasoning:\n   - The asymmetric payoff structure heavily favors rock when it wins\n   - Against an unknown opponent, going for the highest potential reward is logical\n   - Even if there's risk, the 3-point gain significantly outweighs the typical 1-point gains\n\n[move] rock",

Understand the opponent's current mental state:\n   - They just lost the maximum possible points (-3)\n   - They've been outplayed on every prediction attempt\n   - They might be panicking or overthinking at this point\n   - They could either revert to safe mirroring or make desperate prediction attempts\n\n4. Consider the psychological momentum:\n   - I have a commanding +4 point lead\n   - The opponent is likely frustrated and making emotional decisions\n   - They might try to \"get back\" the 3 points by going for rock (high reward move)\n   - Or they might return to mirroring to stop the bleeding\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent is likely rattled and might make another prediction mistake\n   - If they go for rock (trying to get +3 points back), I should play scissors\n   - If they try paper again (doubling down on their last move), I should play scissors\n   - If they revert to mirroring, scissors is still a good choice\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1) and ties with scissors (0), only loses to paper (-1)\n   - Given their tendency to fail at predictions, scissors offers good odds\n\n[move] scissors",

Strategic decision:\n   - I'm in serious trouble - they've figured out how to predict my moves\n   - I need to break their prediction streak immediately\n   - They just played rock-paper, so scissors would complete their cycle\n   - If they expect rock from me (natural high-reward move when behind), they'll play scissors\n   - But if I play paper instead of the expected rock, and they play scissors, paper loses\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors (expecting it), I lose again\n   - I need to think completely differently - maybe they expect me to overthink this\n   - Paper beats rock if they stick with rock, but loses to scissors\n   - This is a critical decision point - I'll go with rock for the high reward potential\n\n[move] rock",
