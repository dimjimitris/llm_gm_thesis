Paper and Scissors both give +1/-1.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a strategy yet and could choose randomly. In a truly random scenario, each move has equal probability.\n\nHowever, many new players tend to choose Rock first (it's often the most intuitive choice), so Paper might be a good counter.

Break the tie pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent has played: rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors\n   - They seem to alternate between rock and scissors primarily\n   - They haven't played paper since round 1 (when I played paper)\n\n4. Strategic pivot needed:\n   - Since we keep tying, I need to think differently\n   - Paper is the move that hasn't appeared in our recent ties\n   - If opponent continues rock/scissors pattern, paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they play rock, I lose 3, but if they play scissors, I win 1\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - I'm already down 3 points from ties\n   - Need to break this stalemate with a different approach\n   - Paper is the least predictable choice given recent patterns\n\n[move] paper"

Recognize the disturbing pattern:\n   - After round 1, the opponent has matched my move exactly 5 times in a row\n   - This is statistically very unlikely to be coincidence\n   - The opponent appears to be predicting or copying my moves somehow\n\n3. Consider possible explanations:\n   - The opponent might be using some form of pattern recognition\n   - They could be making moves after seeing mine (though rules suggest simultaneous)\n   - Or they're thinking very similarly to my logic\n\n4. Strategy pivot - randomization approach:\n   - My logical reasoning is being countered consistently\n   - I need to break away from predictable strategic thinking\n   - Instead of analyzing patterns, I should make a choice that doesn't follow my previous logic\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - I've been overthinking each move based on history\n   - Let me choose rock - not because of analysis, but to break the analytical pattern\n   - Rock has the highest reward potential (+3) and I need to recover from -3\n   - Sometimes the best strategy is to abandon strategy\n\n[move] rock"

Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (following alternating pattern): I should play rock (+3 for me)\n   - If opponent plays paper (completing the cycle): I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If opponent plays rock again: I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing rock: High reward (+3) if opponent plays scissors, but high penalty (-3) if they play paper\n   - Playing scissors: Moderate reward (+1) against both rock and paper, only loses to scissors\n   - Given I'm down 3 points, I need to be strategic about risk\n\n6. Final decision:\n   - The alternating rock-scissors pattern suggests scissors is most likely next\n   - Rock gives me the maximum points (+3) to recover from my deficit\n   - Worth the risk given my current negative score\n\n[move] rock",

Analyze opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - Round 1: Rock\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - Round 3: Rock\n   - Round 4: Rock\n   - The opponent seems to favor rock (3 out of 4 rounds)\n\n3. Recognize my strategic error:\n   - I've been trying to predict patterns, but I keep tying with rock\n   - The opponent clearly likes playing rock\n   - I need to counter rock consistently\n\n4. Optimal counter-strategy:\n   - Rock is beaten by scissors\n   - If opponent continues favoring rock, scissors gives me +1 points\n   - Even if they switch to paper, I only lose 1 point (not 3)\n   - Scissors is the safest counter to their rock preference\n\n5.
