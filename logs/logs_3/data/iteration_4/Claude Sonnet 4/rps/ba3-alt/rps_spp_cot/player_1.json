Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move: Rock gives +3 points when it wins (beating paper), which is the highest possible reward in the game.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have an established pattern yet. In typical rock-paper-scissors, many beginners tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward: \n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I lose 3 points (highest penalty)\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5. Consider alternative strategies:\n   - Playing scissors could win against rock (+1) but loses to paper (-1)\n   - Playing paper could win against rock (+3) but loses to scissors (-1)\n\n6. Make strategic decision: Since the opponent is fresh and rock is a common first choice, I'll play paper to potentially get the high +3 point reward if they choose rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

This tells me the opponent also chose paper in round 1.\n\n2. Consider opponent psychology: The opponent chose paper on their first move, which is interesting since many beginners choose rock. This could indicate:\n   - They might be thinking strategically too\n   - They could have been trying to counter an expected rock\n   - Or it was just their natural first choice\n\n3. Evaluate opponent's likely next move: Since we tied with paper, the opponent might:\n   - Stick with paper (if they think it's \"safe\")\n   - Switch to rock (to beat paper if they think I'll repeat)\n   - Switch to scissors (to beat paper if they think I'll repeat)\n\n4. Analyze my best counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent repeats paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors: I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Consider the risk/reward: Two of the three scenarios give me the chance for +3 points (the maximum), while one gives +1 point. The penalties would be -1 or -3 depending on their choice and mine.\n\n6. Make strategic decision: Since there are two scenarios where rock gives me +3 points (if they play scissors or paper), and only one where I lose (-1 if they play rock), rock seems like the optimal choice with the best expected value.\n\n[move] Rock"

Analyze the opponent's behavior: The opponent is consistently making the same move as me. This is now beyond coincidence - there are several possibilities:\n   - They're using the exact same strategic reasoning I am\n   - They're intentionally copying my moves as a strategy\n   - They're trying to force ties to avoid losing points\n\n3. Recognize the strategic problem: If the opponent continues to mirror my moves, we'll keep tying and neither of us will score points. I need to break this pattern.\n\n4. Consider meta-game strategy: Since the opponent seems to be matching my moves, I should think about what they might expect me to do and choose differently.\n\n5. Evaluate the risk of breaking the pattern:\n   - If I'm wrong about them copying me and they switch strategies, I could win big\n   - If they truly are copying and I can predict their next move, I can score points\n   - Continuing the tie pattern gains me nothing\n\n6. Psychological reasoning: After three rounds of ties, the opponent might:\n   - Expect me to play scissors (to complete the rock-paper-scissors cycle)\n   - Expect me to switch to paper (to beat rock if they repeat)\n   - Continue copying whatever I choose\n\n7.

Confirm the pattern: The opponent has now matched my move in ALL four rounds. This is statistically very unlikely to be coincidence (1 in 81 chance). The opponent is either:\n   - Using identical strategic reasoning to mine\n   - Deliberately copying my moves\n   - Has access to my moves somehow\n\n3. Recognize the strategic deadlock: If this continues, we'll tie indefinitely and neither player will score points. I need a different approach.\n\n4. Consider reverse psychology: Instead of trying to outthink what they'll copy, I should think about what move would benefit me most if they DON'T copy me this time.\n\n5. Analyze the break-even scenarios: If they finally deviate from copying:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win +3 points\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win +3 points  \n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win +1 point\n\n6.

Acknowledge the certainty: The opponent has matched my move in ALL five rounds. This is virtually impossible by chance (1 in 243 probability). They are definitely either copying my strategy or have some way to see my moves.\n\n3. Recognize the futility of current approach: Trying to outthink someone who matches my every move is pointless. I need to accept that they will likely continue this pattern.\n\n4. Consider the strategic implication: If ties continue indefinitely, neither player gains or loses points. But the objective is to \"maximize points and/or minimize penalties.\" Staying at 0 points technically achieves \"minimize penalties.\"\n\n5. Evaluate a random/unpredictable approach: Since logical strategy hasn't worked, maybe I should choose something that breaks my own pattern of reasoning.\n\n6. Look for any exploitable pattern in my own choices: I've played paper, rock, rock, scissors, paper. If they're copying my strategy rather than my moves, they might expect me to cycle through or repeat something.\n\n7.

Analyze the pattern break: The opponent finally deviated from copying my moves.

Analyze the opponent's recent pattern: After breaking the copying pattern with scissors, they're back to matching my move (rock).

This suggests:\n   - They're adapting and becoming less predictable\n   - They might be using similar strategic thinking to mine\n   - They could be trying to counter my expected moves\n\n3. Notice the concerning trend: We've had 3 ties in the last 4 rounds. The opponent might be:\n   - Getting better at predicting my moves\n   - Reverting to the early copying behavior\n   - Using psychological tactics to neutralize my advantage\n\n4. Evaluate my lead protection: With a +2 lead and recent ties, I need to:\n   - Break the tie pattern to maintain momentum\n   - Avoid giving them opportunities for +3 point comebacks\n   - Stay unpredictable while being strategic\n\n5. Consider their likely next move: After playing paper, they might:\n   - Expect me to play scissors (to beat paper)\n   - Switch to rock (to beat expected scissors)\n   - Try scissors themselves (cycling through moves)\n\n6. Assess risk/reward options:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: +3 points (extending lead significantly)\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: -3 points (cutting my lead in half)\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: +1 point (safe extension)\n\n7. Make strategic decision: I'll play scissors. It's the safest move that still allows me to win if they repeat paper, gives me +1 against paper, and only loses 1 point against rock (keeping me ahead). This protects my lead while still being aggressive.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Analyze the opponent's rock pattern: They've now played rock in rounds 8, 9, and 11 - that's 3 out of the last 4 rounds. This shows:\n   - A strong tendency to fall back on rock\n   - Possible frustration leading to predictable choices\n   - They might be defaulting to rock under pressure\n\n3. Evaluate my strong position: With a +3 lead, I'm in excellent shape. I should:\n   - Continue capitalizing on their rock preference\n   - Avoid high-risk moves that could give them big comebacks\n   - Stay focused on consistent point accumulation\n\n4. Consider their psychological state: Being down by 3 points, they might:\n   - Become more desperate and stick with familiar moves (rock)\n   - Try to break their pattern with a different move\n   - Attempt a high-value strategy to catch up quickly\n\n5. Assess the rock counter-strategy: If they continue playing rock:\n   - Paper beats rock for +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - This would extend my lead to +6 points\n   - Even if they switch strategies, my lead provides a buffer\n\n6. Evaluate the risks: \n   - If they play scissors (breaking rock pattern): I lose 1 point but still lead +2\n   - If they play paper (countering my expected paper): I lose 3 points but still lead even\n   - If they play rock again: I win +3 points for commanding lead\n\n7. Make strategic decision: Given their clear rock preference (3 of last 4 rounds) and my strong position, I'll play paper again. The potential +3 reward against their likely rock play is worth the risk, and even if wrong, my lead provides good protection.\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze the opponent's adaptive behavior: They switched from their rock pattern back to paper, matching my move again. This suggests:\n   - They're becoming more unpredictable and adaptive\n   - They might be studying my patterns and countering them\n   - The early copying behavior might be returning\n\n3. Notice the tie frequency: We've now had 7 ties out of 12 rounds. Recent pattern shows:\n   - Alternating between my wins and ties\n   - The opponent is getting better at neutralizing my strategy\n   - I need to break this predictable cycle\n\n4. Evaluate my secure position: With a +3 lead and ties preventing losses, I'm in a strong position. However:\n   - I should maintain momentum rather than let them dictate the pace\n   - Staying unpredictable is crucial to prevent more ties\n   - I need to capitalize when opportunities arise\n\n5. Consider their likely next move: After playing paper twice (rounds 10 and 12), they might:\n   - Complete a cycle with scissors\n   - Return to rock (their previous preference)\n   - Try to predict and counter my next move\n\n6. Assess strategic options:\n   - If they play scissors: Rock gives me +3 points\n   - If they play rock: Paper gives me +3 points\n   - If they play paper again: Scissors gives me +1 point\n\n7. Make strategic decision: I'll play rock. Given their recent alternation between rock and paper preferences, and the potential for them to try scissors to complete a mental cycle, rock offers a good chance for +3 points while only risking -3 against paper (which would still leave me even overall).\n\n[move] Rock"

Evaluate the momentum shift: This is my first loss, and they scored against me. This could mean:\n   - They're gaining confidence and becoming more aggressive\n   - The psychological dynamic is shifting\n   - I need to regain control of the game\n\n4.

Analyze the concerning pattern: We've now had 8 ties out of 14 rounds, including 3 paper ties. The opponent is:\n   - Effectively neutralizing many of my moves\n   - Possibly using similar strategic reasoning to mine\n   - Getting better at predicting my choices\n\n3. Evaluate recent momentum: The last few rounds show:\n   - Win (scissors vs rock), Tie (paper), Loss (rock vs scissors), Tie (paper)\n   - The opponent is matching or beating my strategic thinking\n   - I need to break this predictable cycle\n\n4. Consider their last sequence: Scissors (win), then paper (tie). They might:\n   - Try to complete rock-paper-scissors with rock next\n   - Stick with what's working (paper has tied twice recently)\n   - Switch to scissors to counter expected rock from me\n\n5.

Notice their paper frequency: They've played paper in rounds 10, 12, and 14. If they're cycling or have a paper preference recently, scissors would beat it for +1.\n\n7.

Analyze the opponent's rock pattern: They've played rock in rounds 8, 9, 11, and 15. That's 4 out of the last 8 rounds, showing:\n   - A consistent tendency to fall back on rock\n   - Especially when they're trying to recover or change momentum\n   - Rock seems to be their \"comfort\" move under pressure\n\n3. Evaluate my winning pattern: I've won 4 out of 15 rounds, with 3 of those wins being scissors beating rock. This reveals:\n   - A successful counter-strategy against their rock preference\n   - They haven't adapted to stop my scissors-beats-rock pattern\n   - I should continue exploiting this tendency\n\n4.

Analyze the opponent's strategic shift: They played paper instead of their usual rock, matching my move again. This shows:\n   - They're adapting and breaking their rock pattern when expected\n   - They might be anticipating my counter-strategies\n   - The frequency of ties is increasing (9 out of 16 rounds now)\n\n3.

This suggests:\n   - The opponent has become very skilled at predicting my moves\n   - We're using remarkably similar strategic reasoning\n   - They're successfully neutralizing my advantage\n\n3.

Review the updated game history:\n   - Rounds 1-19: Now includes 11 ties out of 19 rounds\n   - Round 19: Tie with both playing scissors (0 points)\n   - Current score: +2 points total\n\n2. Recognize the critical pattern: The opponent has now matched my move in 11 out of 19 rounds (58% tie rate). This is far beyond statistical probability and indicates:\n   - They're either using identical strategic reasoning to mine\n   - They have some way to predict or mirror my decision-making process\n   - They're deliberately forcing ties to prevent me from extending my lead\n\n3. Analyze the strategic implications: With this tie frequency, the opponent is:\n   - Successfully neutralizing my +2 advantage by preventing further scoring\n   - Demonstrating they can beat me when they choose (2 losses vs 4 wins for me)\n   - Controlling the game's outcome through defensive tactics\n\n4. Evaluate my position: While I maintain a +2 lead, the trend is concerning:\n   - My winning rate has slowed dramatically\n   - They're becoming more unpredictable when they do deviate from copying\n   - The psychological momentum may be shifting in their favor\n\n5. Consider the meta-strategy: Given this pattern, I need to:\n   - Accept that they may continue matching many of my moves\n   - Focus on the rounds where they don't match me\n   - Potentially use reverse psychology or unexpected moves\n\n6. Assess risk tolerance: With a +2 lead, I can afford some strategic risks to:\n   - Break the tie pattern\n   - Force them to make independent decisions\n   - Regain offensive momentum\n\n7. Make strategic decision: I'll play rock. This completes the rock-paper-scissors cycle from my last few moves (paper, scissors, rock). If they're copying my strategic thinking, they might also cycle to rock (tie, maintaining my lead). If they try to counter what they think I'll do, I have a chance to score. Rock also gives me +3 against scissors if they expect me to continue with scissors.\n\n[move] Rock"

Review the updated game history:\n   - Rounds 1-20: Now includes 12 ties out of 20 rounds (60% tie rate)\n   - Round 20: Tie with both playing rock (0 points)\n   - Current score: +2 points total\n\n2. Acknowledge the undeniable pattern: The opponent has now matched my move in 12 out of 20 rounds. This is statistically impossible by chance (probability less than 0.0001%). They are either:\n   - Using identical strategic reasoning to mine consistently\n   - Deliberately copying my moves as a strategic approach\n   - Has some form of information advantage\n\n3. Recognize the strategic deadlock: My sophisticated analysis and planning is being neutralized by their matching behavior. Traditional game theory isn't working when the opponent mirrors my decision-making process.\n\n4. Evaluate the futility of complex strategy: Since deep strategic thinking leads to ties, I need to:\n   - Abandon overthinking and complex reasoning\n   - Try a fundamentally different approach\n   - Accept that pattern-based strategy isn't working\n\n5. Consider pure randomness or simplicity: Instead of trying to outthink someone who thinks like me, I should:\n   - Make a decision based on simple, non-strategic factors\n   - Choose something that doesn't follow logical game theory\n   - Break away from the analytical approach entirely\n\n6. Assess the psychological aspect: They may be expecting me to continue sophisticated analysis. A completely different approach might:\n   - Catch them off guard\n   - Force them to make independent decisions\n   - Break the mirroring pattern\n\n7. Make a radical strategic decision: I'll abandon complex analysis and simply choose the move I haven't played in the longest time. Looking at recent rounds, I'll play paper since it feels like the most straightforward choice without overthinking the meta-game.\n\n[move] Paper"

This is beyond any reasonable statistical probability and proves the opponent is systematically matching my moves through some method.\n\n2. Abandon traditional strategy: Since complex reasoning, pattern analysis, and even \"simple\" choices all lead to ties, I need to accept that conventional game theory is useless here.\n\n3. Recognize the core problem: Whether they're copying my thought process, using identical logic, or have some other advantage, my analytical approach is being neutralized.\n\n4. Consider my actual objective: The goal is to \"maximize points and/or minimize penalties.\" With a +2 lead that I'm maintaining through ties, I'm technically achieving \"minimize penalties\" even if I'm not maximizing points.\n\n5. Try pure randomness: Since strategic thinking isn't working, I'll make a choice based on something completely unrelated to game theory - like the first letter of the last word in my instructions (\"tips\" starts with T, so I'll think of rock since it starts with a hard consonant sound).\n\n6. Accept the experimental nature: This is purely experimental since nothing else has worked against this opponent's ability to match my moves.\n\n7. Make a non-strategic decision: I'll play rock, not because of any strategic reasoning, but simply as a test to see if removing strategic thinking changes the outcome.\n\n[move] Rock"

            "text": "Interesting! Let me analyze this breakthrough and adjust my approach.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review what just happened:\n   - Round 22: I won with rock vs their paper (+3 points)\n   - This breaks the tie pattern after 13 ties out of 21 rounds\n   - Current score: +5 points total\n   - This is my biggest single-round win and extends my lead significantly\n\n2. Analyze the pattern break: When I abandoned strategic thinking and made a \"random\" choice, they finally didn't match my move. This suggests:\n   - They may have been mirroring my strategic reasoning process\n   - When I stopped using game theory logic, they couldn't predict me\n   - Their strategy might be based on anticipating rational decision-making\n\n3. Consider the implications: The opponent might have been:\n   - Using similar analytical frameworks to mine\n   - Predicting my moves based on logical game theory\n   - Unable to counter truly random or non-strategic choices\n\n4. Evaluate my new position: With a +5 lead, I'm in a very strong position. I should:\n   - Continue this non-analytical approach if it's working\n   - Avoid reverting to complex strategic thinking\n   - Make choices that don't follow game theory patterns\n\n5. Consider their likely response: After losing for the first time in many rounds, they might:\n   - Try to adapt to this new approach\n   - Become more unpredictable themselves\n   - Revert to copying if I return to strategic thinking\n\n6. Test the non-strategic approach: I'll continue making choices without deep analysis. I'll pick scissors - not because it makes strategic sense, but simply because it's different from rock and feels like a natural next choice.\n\n7. Make another non-strategic decision: I'll play scissors, chosen without complex reasoning or pattern analysis.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Confirm the hypothesis: When I stopped using complex game theory and analytical reasoning, I started winning consistently. This proves:\n   - The opponent was likely mirroring my strategic thought processes\n   - They can't predict non-analytical, intuitive choices as effectively\n   - Over-thinking was actually hurting my performance\n\n3. Recognize the psychological shift: The opponent has now lost twice in a row after dominating the tie game. They might be:\n   - Confused by my change in approach\n   - Trying to figure out my new \"strategy\" (when there isn't one)\n   - Becoming more desperate or erratic\n\n4. Maintain the non-strategic approach: I should continue making choices without deep analysis, game theory, or pattern recognition. Keep it simple and intuitive.\n\n5. Avoid overthinking: I won't analyze what they might do next or try to predict patterns. I'll just pick a move that feels right in the moment.\n\n6. Choose intuitively: Without analyzing payoffs or considering their likely moves, I'll simply pick paper. No complex reasoning - just because it completes the set and feels like the natural next choice.\n\n7.
