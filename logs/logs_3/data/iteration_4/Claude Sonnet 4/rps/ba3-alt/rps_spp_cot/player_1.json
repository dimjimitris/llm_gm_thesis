    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff matrix to understand the game structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I should consider what move beginners typically make. Many new players often choose rock as their first move because it's commonly thought of as strong or aggressive.\n\n4. If the opponent chooses rock, I should play paper to win 3 points.\n\n5. Even if they don't choose rock, paper is a reasonable choice because:\n   - If they play scissors, I lose only 1 point\n   - If they play paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If they play rock, I win 3 points\n\n6. The expected value seems favorable for paper given the potential high reward against rock and limited downside.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on a new player's likely choice of rock, while maintaining reasonable risk management.\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Steps:\n\n1. The previous round ended in a tie with both players choosing paper. This gives me information about my opponent's behavior.\n\n2. I need to consider what this tells me about the opponent:\n   - They also chose paper, which suggests they might have similar reasoning to mine\n   - They could be thinking strategically about the payoff matrix\n   - Or they might have chosen paper randomly\n\n3. Now I need to predict their next move. There are several possibilities:\n   - They might stick with paper since it tied\n   - They might switch to rock thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter if they think I'll play paper again\n   - They might try to be unpredictable\n\n4. Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - If I expect them to play paper again, I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If I expect them to play rock, I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If I expect them to play scissors, I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n5. Given that we both played paper last round, there's a reasonable chance they might switch to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper), or they might play scissors (trying to counter my potential paper).\n\n6. Rock seems like a strong choice because:\n   - If they play paper (same as last round), I win 3 points\n   - If they play scissors (countering expected paper), I win 1 point\n   - If they play rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially capitalize on them repeating paper or switching to scissors.\n\n[move] rock"
