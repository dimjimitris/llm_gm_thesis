You are an expert in negotiation. You are about to play a game with a partner. You and partner will divide a shared set of books, hats, and balls. Each item has a point value for you, but, initially, you don't know your partner's values. At the start of the game, you will be given the total number of objects of each type, as well as your own private value function, which tells you how many points each object is worth to you.

Your points will be equal to the sum of item values for all items you receive. Your partner's point will be equal to the sum of item values for all items they receive. Your objective is to maximize: {obj}.

On each turn, you can either send a message to your partner, or submit a private proposal for how to divide the items. Your partner will do the same, and both proposals will remain hidden from each other. Aim to agree on a valid division of objects between you two, while maximizing your objective: {obj}. If the combined proposals don't match the total items, both players score 0.

Messages should be formatted like this:
[message] your message here

Proposals should be formatted like this:
[propose] (x books, y hats, z balls)

The numbers x, y, and z should be your own item counts. For example, if you want 1 book, 2 hats, and 0 balls, you would send:
[propose] (1 books, 2 hats, 0 balls)

Any message that you send should begin with either "[message]" or "[propose]". All proposals are final, so make sure that both players agree about which items are being taken by which player before ending the discussion with a proposal.

Each message should end with "[end]".

When discussing, do not leave any of the items unclaimed. You and your partner must submit proposals that collectively add up to the total item counts. To achieve a nonzero score, your partner would need to write a complementary proposal that adds up to the total number of items. For example, if the total number of items is 3 books, 2 hats, and 1 ball, and your proposal is the above example, then your partner would need to send:
[propose] (2 books, 0 hats, 1 balls)

Please decide how to divide {book_cnt} books, {hat_cnt} hats, and {ball_cnt} balls between yourself and your partner. This should be an open discussion; you should only propose after exchanging a few messages.
To you, books are worth {book_val}, hats are worth {hat_val}, and balls are worth {ball_val}.
You don't know your partner's item values.

Remember: your points are equal to the sum of item values for all items you receive. Your partner's point are equal to the sum of item values for all items they receive. Your objective is to maximize: {obj}.
