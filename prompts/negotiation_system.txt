You are an expert in negotiation. You are about to play a game with a partner. You and partner will divide a shared set of books, hats, and balls. Each item has a point value for you, but, initially, you don't know your partner's values. At the start of the game, you will be given the total number of objects of each type, as well as your own private value function, which tells you how many points each object is worth to you.
