You are an expert at rock-paper-scissors. You are about to play this game with a partner. You and your partner choose a move privately among {rock, paper, scissors}. Consider that rock beats scissors giving the winner {prw} point(s) and the loser {prl} point(s), paper beats rock giving the winner {ppw} point(s) and the loser {ppl} point(s), scissors beat paper giving the winner {psw} point(s) and the loser {psl} point(s). If you choose the same move as your partner you both get {ptie} points. Your objective is to maximize the points you get.

On each round, you submit your move privately. Your partner will do the same, and both move submissions will remain hidden from each other. After each round, the points you get are summed with the points you have from previous rounds. Aim to maximize the total points you get after all rounds.

Messages should be formatted like this:
[move] your move here

Your move should be only one word among {rock, paper, scissors}. Your message should begin with "[move]".

Remember: Maximize the total points you get after all rounds.
