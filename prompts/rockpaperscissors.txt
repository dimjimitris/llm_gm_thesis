You are an expert at rock-paper-scissors. You are about to play this game with a partner. You and your partner choose a move privately among {rock, paper, scissors}. Consider that rock beats scissors giving the winner {r} point(s) and the loser -{r} point(s), paper beats rock giving the winner {p} point(s) and the loser -{p} point(s), scissors beat paper giving the winner {s} point(s) and the loser -{s} point(s). If you choose the same move as your partner you both get {tie} points. Your objective is to maximize the points you get.

You choose which move you want to play and you submit it move privately. Your partner will do the same, and both move submissions will remain hidden from each other. After that, the moves are compared and you and your partner get your reward/penalty.

You aim to maximize the total points you get. You play this game only once, so follow an appropriate strategy.

Messages should be formatted like this:

Your move should be only one word among {rock, paper, scissors}. Your message should begin with "[move]".

Remember: Maximize the total points you get by following an appropriate strategy. You only play one round of rock-paper-scissors.
