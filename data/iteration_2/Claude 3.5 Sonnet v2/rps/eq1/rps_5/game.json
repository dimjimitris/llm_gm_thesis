Recent pattern analysis:\n   - They switched from scissors to rock\n   - We just had a tie with rock\n   - They've shown they adapt quickly\n   - Their moves have become more unpredictable lately\n\n3. Psychological factors after a tie:\n   - Players rarely repeat moves after a tie\n   - They might expect me to play paper to beat rock\n   - They've shown they can anticipate and counter obvious moves\n   - The tie creates pressure to win\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they expect paper from me, they'll play scissors\n   - If they're being cautious, they might play rock again\n   - If they're thinking multiple steps ahead, they might play paper\n   - Their recent gameplay shows higher strategic thinking\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Given their demonstrated ability to counter obvious moves\n   - And their recent success with scissors\n   - And the psychological pressure after a tie\n   - I'll play rock again\n   - This protects against another scissors play\n   - It also creates uncertainty as repeating after a tie is unusual\n   - They might overthink and play paper, but scissors seems their most likely move\n\n[move] rock\n"
