    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For studying opponent patterns and tendencies\n3. Psychology Expert - For understanding human behavior in competitive games\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when playing against a rational opponent with no history, the Nash equilibrium for rock-paper-scissors is to play each option with equal probability (1/3).\n\nPsychology Expert: In the first move of a game, many players tend to choose 'rock' as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. However, knowing this, some players might anticipate this and choose 'paper'. We should consider this psychological aspect.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move with no prior data, we can't rely on pattern analysis yet. I agree with the Game Strategist that a random selection would be theoretically optimal, but the Psychology Expert's insight about first-move tendencies is valuable.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these insights, choosing 'paper' might give us a slight edge against players who favor 'rock' as an opening move, while not being too risky against other options.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. 'Paper' is a balanced choice that could capitalize on the common 'rock' opening while not being too predictable.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper I choose paper as it might give a slight advantage against players who tend to open with rock, while maintaining a balanced position overall.\n"

This could mean either:\n1. They follow similar strategic thinking to us\n2. They have a preference for paper\n3. It was just a coincidence\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent by thinking about what the opponent might expect them to do. The opponent might anticipate us switching to scissors (to beat their previous paper) or sticking with paper (if we think they'll switch).\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has demonstrated rational play in the first round. In such cases, maintaining unpredictability is crucial. However, there's a psychological tendency for players to switch their move after a tie.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given human psychology, most players don't like to repeat the same move three times in a row. Since both players used paper last time, there's a good chance the opponent will switch.\n\nGame Strategist: If we expect the opponent to switch from paper, they would most likely choose either rock or scissors. Between these two, scissors is more likely as it would beat our previous move (paper).\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreeing with the Game Strategist. If they expect us to play paper again, they'll choose scissors. If they expect us to choose scissors (to beat their paper), they might choose rock.\n\nGame Strategist: Therefore, choosing rock would be optimal - it beats their scissors if they try to counter our previous paper, and ties with their rock if they try to counter our potential scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on post-tie psychology and anticipating the opponent's likely adjustment from the previous paper play.\n"

The opponent is very good at predicting our moves\n2. They're using similar psychological reasoning\n3. They might be mirroring our moves (though they wouldn't know our moves beforehand)\n\nGame Strategist: This is a fascinating situation. After two ties, there's often a strong psychological urge to \"break the pattern.\" Given that we've seen paper\u2192rock progression, there might be an expectation to complete the cycle with scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, if both players are thinking at this meta-level, they might try to get ahead of this obvious progression.

Paper vs Paper\n2. Rock vs Rock\n3. Paper vs Paper\nThis suggests our opponent is either using very similar strategic reasoning or has some way of predicting our moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: Three consecutive ties is psychologically significant. At this point, both players are likely feeling:\n1. Frustration at the inability to win\n2. Strong desire to break the pattern\n3. Heightened awareness that both players are thinking similarly\n\nGame Strategist: This situation has moved beyond simple game theory. We're in a complex mind game where both players are clearly capable of similar levels of strategic thinking. The key now is to break this symmetry.\n\nPsychology Expert: In such situations, players often resort to one of two extremes:\n1. Make a completely unexpected move to break the pattern\n2. Stick to the same move, assuming the opponent will surely change\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at our sequence:\nPaper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 ???\nThe sequence itself doesn't show a clear pattern that the opponent might be following. They're likely using strategic reasoning similar to ours.\n\nGame Strategist: Here's where we need to make a bold move. Since both players are likely to try breaking the tie pattern, and both know this, we should use this mutual knowledge to our advantage.\n\nPsychology Expert: After three ties, there's an overwhelming psychological pressure to change. Most players would find it very difficult to choose paper again, even if logic might suggest it. This very pressure to change creates an opportunity.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all this, I suggest scissors. Here's why:\n1. It breaks the recent paper pattern\n2. If they expect us to stick with paper (thinking we might be stubborn), scissors loses\n3. If they expect us to choose rock (as a safe move), scissors loses\n4. But if they choose paper (trying to beat our expected rock), we win\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Breaking from our previous moves, using the psychological pressure for change to our advantage, while accounting for the likely strategic adjustments of an equally skilled opponent.\n"

Our opponent appears to be perfectly matching our strategic thinking process.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a psychologically intense situation. Four ties in a row creates:\n1. Extreme pressure to break the pattern\n2. Potential paranoia about how the opponent is matching us\n3. A meta-game where both players might be overthinking every move\n\nGame Strategist: We need to acknowledge something important here - traditional game theory and psychological analysis are failing us because our opponent is consistently matching our strategic level. We need a different approach.\n\nPsychology Expert: In such situations, players might:\n1. Resort to truly random choice to break the pattern\n2. Become extremely defensive\n3. Make an aggressive attempt to break the pattern with their strongest move\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's look at what we haven't seen much of in our sequence. Rock has only appeared once in our four moves, while paper and scissors have each been played twice.\n\nGame Strategist: Here's a radical suggestion - let's use the fact that rock has been underutilized. However, we shouldn't choose it for that reason alone, as our opponent might reach the same conclusion.\n\nPsychology Expert: After scissors, many players instinctively choose rock as a \"strong\" move to establish dominance. However, given our opponent's demonstrated ability to match our thinking, they might anticipate this.\n\nGame Strategist: We're in a situation where any attempt at complex strategy might be matched. Sometimes, the best strategy when facing an equally skilled opponent is to embrace simplicity.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. In this case, the simplest move might be the most effective. Rock is indeed the natural counter to the previous scissors move, and trying to overthink it might be counterproductive.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Making this choice not because it's strategically complex, but precisely because it's the simplest, most straightforward response to the previous round.
