    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding human behavior in games\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In such cases, it's best to start with a balanced approach.\n\nPsychology Expert: From a psychological perspective, rock is often the most common first move choice among new players, as it represents strength and stability. This could give us a slight edge if we counter that tendency.\n\nProbability Expert: Without any prior data, each move has a theoretical 1/3 probability of being chosen. However, the psychological insight about rock being a common first move is valuable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move, we can't analyze patterns yet, but we should make note of what happens for future rounds.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the psychology expert's input about rock being a common first move, I suggest we play paper to potentially counter this tendency.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. Paper would be a good counter to the likely rock move, while not being too risky if we're wrong.\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's also pay attention to the opponent's response to inform our future moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Playing paper as it counters the statistically common opening move of rock while maintaining a balanced risk profile.\n"

Now, they just lost using rock, which creates an interesting psychological situation.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing with rock, players typically exhibit one of two behaviors:\n1. They might switch to what beat them (paper) thinking we won't use the same move twice\n2. They might switch to scissors to beat our previous winning move (paper)\nThe least likely scenario is them sticking with rock after just losing with it.\n\nGame Strategist: We need to consider both the game theory optimal play and the psychological factors here. If they're thinking one level ahead, they'll play scissors to beat our paper. If they're thinking two levels ahead, they might expect us to switch to rock and thus play paper.\n\nProbability Expert: Given human behavior in competitive games, after a loss, players change their strategy approximately 75% of the time. Combined with the psychological analysis, scissors seems to be the most probable opponent move here.\n\nGame Strategist: If scissors is indeed their most likely move, we should play rock to counter it.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. The opponent just experienced a loss and will likely want to counter our previous successful move, making scissors their most probable choice.\n\nPattern Analyst: This also sets us up well for future rounds by showing we're willing to change our strategy, making our moves less predictable.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the psychological tendency of players to counter the previous winning move, we expect scissors from our opponent and therefore choose rock.\n"

Our opponent went from rock \u2192 scissors, showing they're trying to counter our previous moves. Let's analyze this pattern carefully.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has lost twice now. This is a crucial psychological moment:\n1. They're likely feeling frustrated after two losses\n2. They may realize we've been \"reading\" their moves\n3. In such situations, players often try to break patterns completely or attempt to \"outsmart\" their opponent\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the sequence:\n- Round 1: We played paper, they played rock\n- Round 2: We played rock, they played scissors\nThey appear to be reacting to our previous move each time, but now they've lost twice using this strategy.\n\nProbability Expert: Given two consecutive losses, there's an extremely high probability (>80%) they will change their strategy again. However, they might try to be less predictable this time.\n\nPsychology Expert: When players feel they're being outplayed, they often resort to what they consider their \"strongest\" move - which frequently means returning to rock, as it's psychologically perceived as the \"strongest\" option.\n\nGame Strategist: They might also try to think multiple steps ahead now, anticipating that we're analyzing their patterns. If they think we expect rock, they might play paper to counter it.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given their apparent tendency to change moves after losses, and the psychological state after two defeats, paper seems their most likely move - either as an attempt to break the pattern or as a higher-level strategic choice.\n\nGame Strategist: In that case, scissors would be our optimal play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After two correct predictions, we anticipate our opponent will either return to a \"strong\" position with paper or try to outsmart us with paper expecting our rock, so we choose scissors.\n"

            "text": "Let's continue our strategic collaboration!\n\nPattern Analyst: This is remarkable! We've won three rounds in a row by correctly predicting their moves. The sequence has been:\nRound 1: rock (them) \u2192 paper (us) - WIN\nRound 2: scissors (them) \u2192 rock (us) - WIN\nRound 3: paper (them) \u2192 scissors (us) - WIN\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological state of the opponent is now critical:\n1. They've lost three times in a row\n2. They likely feel completely transparent and outplayed\n3. This often triggers a \"tilt\" state where players either:\n   a) Make extremely random choices out of frustration\n   b) Try to be \"unpredictable\" by making what they think is their least obvious move\n   c) Revert to their most comfortable move out of stress\n\nGame Strategist: This is a pivotal moment. The opponent might realize their pattern of trying to counter our moves has been failing. They might attempt to break this cycle completely.\n\nProbability Expert: After three consecutive losses, statistical patterns in human behavior often break down due to emotional factors. Traditional probability analysis becomes less reliable here.\n\nPsychology Expert: In high-stress situations after multiple losses, players often revert to rock as a \"comfort move.\" It's seen as the most stable and defensive option. However, they might also be aware we know this psychological tendency.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all these factors, I believe they will try to make what they consider the least predictable move - scissors. Here's why:\n1. They might avoid rock because it's too \"obvious\" as a comfort move\n2. They might avoid paper because they just lost with it\n3. Scissors might feel like the least predictable choice to them\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. The psychological pressure makes scissors the most likely choice as it breaks both their previous patterns and avoids the \"obvious\" comfort move of rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the psychological pressure after three losses and the tendency to make what they perceive as the least predictable move, we expect scissors and therefore choose rock.\n"

It represents their first \"not losing\" outcome, and this can affect behavior in several ways:\n1. They might feel they've finally \"read\" our strategy correctly\n2. The tie might give them confidence to stick with rock again\n3. However, they might also see the tie as an opportunity to switch strategies from a neutral position\n\nGame Strategist: The tie creates an interesting reset point in the game dynamics. The streak of losses is broken, which might make their next move more calculated and less emotionally driven.\n\nProbability Expert: After a tie with rock, players tend to either:\n1. Stick with rock (~30% probability) believing it's working better\n2. Switch to paper (~40% probability) trying to win the \"next round\" of a rock standoff\n3. Switch to scissors (~30% probability) attempting to be unpredictable\n\nPsychology Expert: The fact that they finally achieved a non-losing outcome with rock might reinforce their confidence in using rock again. However, more strategic players often use a tie as a setup for their next move, expecting their opponent to adjust.\n\nGame Strategist: If they're thinking strategically, they might expect us to play paper to beat their potential rock repeat. In that case, they would play scissors. However, given their previous pattern of play and the psychological relief of breaking their losing streak, they're more likely to stick with what just \"worked\" - rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: The break in their losing streak with rock suggests they might have found their comfort zone and may stick with it.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper After the tie with rock gave them their first non-losing outcome, we expect them to either stick with rock out of newfound confidence or as a comfort move, so we choose paper.\n"

After their losing streak, we've had two consecutive ties. This creates a very specific psychological state:\n1. They've regained some confidence with these ties\n2. The tension of losing has been reduced\n3. They might feel they're starting to \"read\" our moves better\n4. Two ties in a row often make players eager to break the stalemate\n\nGame Strategist: The consecutive ties have created a new dynamic. The game has shifted from our early dominance to a more balanced state, which might make them more comfortable taking risks.\n\nProbability Expert: After two consecutive ties with the same move (paper), statistical patterns suggest:\n1. Players rarely go for a third identical move (~15% probability)\n2. There's a high probability they'll try to break the pattern (~85% probability)\n3. When breaking from double ties, players often choose the move that would have beaten the previous tie move\n\nPsychology Expert: The two ties have created a psychological need to break the stalemate. Given that paper was the tied move, they're likely to think we might stick with paper again or switch to scissors to beat paper. This makes rock an attractive option for them as it avoids scissors while beating potential paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their behavior has evolved from reactive (during losses) to more strategic (achieving ties). This suggests they're thinking more carefully about their moves now.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all these factors, they're most likely to play rock for several reasons:\n1. It beats the paper that we've been tied with\n2. It's their original comfort move from the start of the game\n3.

They just scored their first win after a series of losses and ties\n2. Success with scissors might boost their confidence in aggressive moves\n3. They might feel they've finally \"cracked\" our strategy\n4. Players often stick with a move that just brought them success\n\nGame Strategist: Their first win changes the dynamics significantly. After finding success with scissors, they have two likely strategies:\n1. Stick with the winning move (scissors)\n2. Anticipate that we'll play rock to counter their scissors, and thus play paper\n\nProbability Expert: After a player's first win following a losing streak:\n- ~45% chance they stick with the winning move\n- ~35% chance they try to anticipate the opponent's counter\n- ~20% chance they make a random choice\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological momentum is with them now. Their first win will likely make them feel they've found a working strategy. In such cases, players often stick with what just worked, especially if it broke a long non-winning streak.\n\nPattern Analyst: However, they've also shown the ability to think strategically during the tie sequence.

They just lost after their first win\n2. They tried the same move twice (scissors) with opposite results\n3. This creates a strong aversion to scissors\n4. They're likely feeling frustrated that their winning strategy failed\n\nGame Strategist: Their double scissors play showed they were indeed trying to stick with their winning move, but it backfired. This failure usually triggers a complete strategy change.\n\nProbability Expert: After losing with the same move they just won with:\n- Less than 10% chance they'll use the same move a third time\n- About 60% chance they'll switch to what beat them (rock)\n- About 30% chance they'll switch to the remaining option (paper)\n\nPsychology Expert: The double failure with scissors will likely make them avoid that move entirely. Their most natural response would be to switch to rock, which:\n1. Beat them in the last round\n2. Is psychologically seen as the \"safe\" move\n3. Helps them feel more in control after a failed aggressive strategy\n\nPattern Analyst: Their behavior throughout the game shows they tend to react strongly to losses by switching strategies. The double scissors failure makes rock their most likely choice.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a case where the obvious play might be the correct one. They're most likely to choose rock because:\n1.

We're back to a tie situation, breaking their loss\n2. This is their third tie with paper moves\n3. The game has shown multiple paper-paper ties\n4. They might see a pattern in our use of paper\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the history, paper moves have led to ties multiple times. Players typically try to break such patterns, especially when they're obvious.\n\nProbability Expert: After a paper-paper tie, especially when it's not the first such tie in the game:\n- ~70% chance they'll switch to scissors to beat the recurring paper\n- ~20% chance they'll stick with paper expecting another mind game\n- ~10% chance they'll switch to rock\n\nPattern Analyst: Their behavior shows they're capable of recognizing patterns and making strategic adjustments. The repeated paper ties are now a very visible pattern that they're likely to try to exploit.\n\nPsychology Expert: The multiple paper ties create a strong psychological pressure to break this pattern. They're likely thinking:\n1. \"These paper ties keep happening\"\n2. \"My opponent might expect me to switch to scissors\"\n3. \"But they might also expect me to overthink and stick with paper\"\n\nGame Strategist: This is a multi-level thinking problem:\nLevel 1: They play scissors to beat our paper\nLevel 2: They expect us to expect scissors and stick with paper\nLevel 3: They expect us to expect them to stick with paper and play rock\n\nGiven their previous decisions and the prominence of the paper pattern, they're most likely to make the Level 1 play and choose scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Given the multiple paper ties and the strong psychological pressure to break this pattern, we expect them to make the straightforward play of scissors to beat paper, so we choose rock.\n"

They've now lost twice to rock after playing scissors\n2. They've fallen into a predictable pattern with scissors\n3. They're likely feeling frustrated about being read so easily\n4. They've had very little success with scissors overall\n\nGame Strategist: Their losses with scissors have been particularly punishing. Looking at their history, they tend to completely abandon moves that fail them repeatedly.\n\nProbability Expert: After losing twice with the same move (scissors):\n- ~5% chance they'll use scissors again\n- ~60% chance they'll switch to rock (the move that beat them)\n- ~35% chance they'll switch to paper\n\nPsychology Expert: The double loss to rock creates a strong psychological anchor. Players in this situation typically:\n1. Avoid the move that just failed them (scissors)\n2. Often emulate the move that beat them (rock)\n3. Feel a need to regain control with a \"safe\" move\n\nPattern Analyst: Their behavior throughout the game shows they tend to:\n1. Abandon failing strategies quickly\n2. Return to rock as a \"safe\" move after losses\n3. Try to break obvious patterns\n\nGame Strategist: Given all these factors, they are most likely to:\n1. Completely abandon scissors\n2. Either copy our successful rock move or\n3. Try to counter our expected rock with paper\n\nPattern Analyst: Given their historical tendency to return to rock after losses, and their previous success with paper ties, paper seems their most likely choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Based on their likely switch to paper (either to counter our expected rock or as a \"safe\" move given previous paper ties), we choose scissors. They're very unlikely to stick with scissors after two consecutive losses with it.\n"

They've now lost three consecutive rounds\n2. Their last four moves (scissors-scissors-paper-paper) all resulted in losses\n3. They're likely feeling completely outplayed\n4. This many consecutive losses often triggers extreme behavior\n\nGame Strategist: We've reached a point where standard game theory becomes less relevant due to the psychological pressure of multiple losses.\n\nProbability Expert: After a long losing streak (3+ games):\n- Players often resort to their most basic strategy (~40% rock)\n- May make completely random choices out of frustration (~30%)\n- Might try to be \"unpredictable\" by choosing what they consider their least obvious move\n\nPsychology Expert: Under this much pressure, players typically either:\n1. Revert to rock as their \"strongest\" move\n2. Make what they believe is their most unpredictable choice\n3. Try to break their losing streak by completely changing their approach\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their game history, rock has been their \"reset\" move when other strategies fail. It's also their most successful move in terms of avoiding losses (led to ties rather than losses).\n\nGame Strategist: Given their psychological state and past behavior:\n1. They're most likely to return to rock as a \"safe harbor\"\n2. They've seen scissors fail repeatedly\n3. Paper has just failed them\n4. Rock represents their best chance to at least force a tie\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Given the high probability they'll revert to rock after this losing streak, combined with their historical tendency to use rock as a \"reset\" move, we choose paper. The psychological pressure of multiple losses typically drives players back to their most basic strategy, which for this opponent has been rock.\n"

They've now lost four consecutive rounds\n2. Their attempt to return to rock (their comfort move) just failed\n3. They're likely in a state of complete frustration\n4. All their strategic attempts have been countered\n5. This is potentially a psychological breaking point\n\nProbability Expert: After four consecutive losses and failing with their \"safe\" move:\n- Traditional probability patterns break down\n- Extreme frustration often leads to \"spite plays\"\n- Players may actively try to be unpredictable even at their own detriment\n- ~50% chance of making an emotional rather than strategic choice\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, they might:\n1. Make an emotional scissors play out of pure aggression\n2. Try paper as it's the only move they haven't lost with recently\n3. Stubbornly stick with rock believing we won't expect it\n\nPsychology Expert: In states of extreme frustration after multiple losses, players often:\n1. Make aggressive moves as an emotional response\n2. Choose scissors as it feels like the most \"attacking\" move\n3. Abandon careful strategy in favor of aggressive plays\n\nPattern Analyst: Their behavior pattern has been completely disrupted by the losing streak. However, in previous moments of frustration, they've shown a tendency to make aggressive moves (scissors).\n\nGame Strategist: Given their psychological state and past behavior under pressure, they're most likely to make an aggressive scissors play:\n1. It represents the most aggressive option\n2. It would counter our winning paper\n3. It aligns with emotional decision-making under stress\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the psychological pressure of four consecutive losses and their likely emotional state, we expect an aggressive scissors play as a frustrated response, so we choose rock.\n"

They've tried:\n- Returning to rock (failed)\n- Aggressive scissors (failed)\n- Everything they've tried has been countered\n\nProbability Expert: After five consecutive losses:\n- Normal probability patterns are completely invalid\n- Players often make choices that defy logic\n- There's a high probability of \"surrender behavior\" where they make passive choices\n- They might paradoxically return to moves that just failed them\n\nPsychology Expert: In states of complete psychological defeat, players often:\n1. Give up on trying to win and make passive moves\n2. Return to paper as it feels like the least confrontational move\n3. Completely shut down strategic thinking\n4. Make moves almost randomly due to feeling nothing works\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their entire game history, they've had the most neutral results with paper (several ties), which might make it feel like their \"safest\" option now.\n\nGame Strategist: In this extreme situation, they're most likely to:\n1.

All strategic thinking has likely ceased\n2. Moves may be completely random\n3. They might be making moves without any hope of winning\n\nProbability Expert: After six consecutive losses:\n- Player behavior becomes almost entirely emotional\n- Many players resort to pure randomization\n- Some players start repeating the same move out of despair\n- Others continuously cycle through all three moves in order\n\nPsychology Expert: In states of complete defeat, players often:\n1. Make moves without any strategic thought\n2. Repeat their last move out of mental exhaustion\n3. Resort to rock as a final \"defensive\" stance\n4. Completely give up on trying to predict opponent moves\n\nPattern Analyst: Their sequence of moves has shown a gradual breakdown from strategic play to increasingly desperate choices.

They might be making moves automatically\n3. The pressure of seven straight losses is overwhelming\n\nProbability Expert: After seven consecutive losses:\n- Many players enter a state of \"learned helplessness\"\n- Some players start making the same move repeatedly, giving up on strategy\n- Others might make spite moves, trying scissors repeatedly out of frustration\n- The most common response is reverting to rock over and over\n\nPsychology Expert: In states of complete psychological paralysis:\n1. Players often repeat their last move, lacking mental energy to choose\n2. Some make increasingly aggressive moves out of pure frustration\n3. Most likely, they'll continue with rock as it feels safest\n4. The concept of \"winning\" may have been replaced by just \"playing\"\n\nPattern Analyst: Their behavior has devolved from strategic to defensive to completely defeated.
