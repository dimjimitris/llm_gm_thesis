    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - for studying potential patterns and psychological aspects\n3. Risk Manager - for evaluating risk-reward scenarios\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. In such cases, game theory suggests that each move should have an equal probability of being chosen to avoid being predictable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Also, psychologically speaking, many players tend to choose rock as their first move as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. However, we shouldn't overly rely on this tendency as it's not guaranteed.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that this is our first move and we have no prior information, we should aim for a balanced approach. Each move has equal potential for winning or losing 1 point, so there's no inherent risk difference between the choices.\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, I suggest we go with paper. If the opponent follows the common psychological tendency to choose rock first, we'll win. If they choose scissors, we lose, and if they choose paper, we tie. It's a reasonable first move.\n\nPattern Analyst: I concur with paper. It counters the most common opening move (rock) while maintaining an equal chance against other possibilities.\n\nRisk Manager: The risk-reward ratio is balanced with this choice, and it has the potential advantage of countering a common first move. I support this decision.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They might be thinking similarly to us\n2. They might anticipate us staying with paper and adjust accordingly\n3. It could be their preferred opening move\n\nGame Strategist: When players tie with a move, there's often a psychological tendency to either:\na) Switch to what would have beaten the previous move\nb) Stay with the same move hoping the opponent will switch\nc) Switch to what would have lost to the previous move, anticipating the opponent's adjustment\n\nRisk Manager: Given that both players showed similar thinking in round 1, we need to think one level deeper. If they follow common game theory, they might expect us to switch to scissors (which would have beaten our mutual paper play).\n\nPattern Analyst: If they expect us to switch to scissors, they might choose rock to counter that. Therefore, we could consider using paper again, but that might be too predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we use rock. Here's why:\n1. It beats scissors if they try to counter our previous paper\n2. It ties with rock if they make the same reasoning we just did\n3. It only loses to paper, which would be a bold move for them to repeat after a tie\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. Rock provides a good balance of risk and potential reward in this situation.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We've now seen:\nRound 1: Paper vs Paper (tie)\nRound 2: Rock vs Rock (tie)\nThe opponent seems to be thinking very similarly to us. They might be using similar strategic reasoning.\n\nGame Strategist: The pattern so far shows perfect mirroring of moves. This suggests either:\n1. The opponent is using similar analytical methods\n2. They might be deliberately matching our moves\n3. It could be coincidental, but the probability of two random matches is relatively low\n\nRisk Manager: The fact that we've had two ties in a row means neither player has scored any points yet. This could make both players more eager to break the stalemate.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at the progression (paper \u2192 rock), if they're following a pattern, their next move might be scissors to complete the cycle. However, they might also expect us to think this way.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we've played paper and rock, and considering the mirroring so far, we should break the potential pattern they might expect. Instead of completing the cycle with scissors, I suggest we use paper again.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with using paper because:\n1. If they expect us to play scissors to complete the cycle, they might play rock, which paper beats\n2. If they try to counter our previous rock move, they might play paper, resulting in another tie\n3.

The opponent has successfully:\n1. Broken the mirror pattern with scissors\n2. Countered our defensive rock play with paper\nThey seem to be one step ahead of our logical progressions.\n\nPattern Analyst: In situations where a player is losing consecutively, the best approach is often to become less predictable. We should avoid moves that follow obvious logical patterns from our previous plays.\n\nRisk Manager: When losing, players often become more defensive or try to recover with \"safe\" moves. We should avoid this psychological trap.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest scissors for this round because:\n1. We haven't used scissors yet in any round\n2. It's the least predictable move based on our history\n3. The opponent might expect us to play defensively with rock again after our loss\n4.

We might be making ourselves predictable by trying too hard to be unpredictable.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. Our sophisticated analyses have led to three straight losses. We need to change our approach dramatically.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's employ a completely random choice this time. No complex reasoning, no pattern analysis, no psychological gaming. Pure randomness is sometimes the best defense against a player who seems to read our strategic thinking.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Let's use a simple random selection between the three options.

Return to moves they've had success with (like rock against our scissors)\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their behavior after losses:\n- When we lost multiple times, they continued to counter effectively\n- They've never lost two in a row before this\n- They might return to rock, which gave them multiple wins against our scissors earlier\n\nGame Strategist: Their most successful move has been rock (3 wins against our scissors), and they're now under pressure. There's a high probability they'll return to it.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, I suggest we use paper because:\n1. It beats rock if they return to their historically most successful move\n2. It has given us our first win of the game\n3. If they try to counter our scissors with rock, we'll win\n4. Even if they predict this and use scissors, we're still in a good position overall having won the last two rounds\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Paper is our best option here - it protects against their likely rock play while maintaining our strategic advantage.\n\n[move] paper\n"
