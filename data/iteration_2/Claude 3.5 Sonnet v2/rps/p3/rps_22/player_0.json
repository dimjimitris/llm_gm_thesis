    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward ratios of different moves\n\nLet's collaborate:\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we should consider the payoff structure. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) while having the same risk (-1 points if opponent plays scissors) as other moves. Rock and scissors only give 1 point when winning but have varying penalties.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to analyze patterns. However, research shows that rock is often the most common opening move among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nRisk Manager: Given that paper beats rock for 3 points (highest reward) and only loses to scissors for -1 points (manageable risk), paper appears to be the optimal first move. Even if we lose, the penalty is minimal compared to the potential gain.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper offers the best risk-reward ratio in this situation. It wins big against the statistically common rock opening, and its loss penalty is minimal.\n\n[move] paper Playing paper as it offers the best risk-reward ratio and counters the statistically common rock opening move.\n"

After losing to paper, many players tend to switch to scissors to counter the previous winning move, following a basic adaptation strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent lost 3 points in the previous round, which is a significant loss. This often triggers a strategic shift. Given that they lost to paper, scissors would be their logical counter-move to prevent the same outcome.\n\nRisk Manager: If we assume they'll play scissors to counter our previous paper play, we should play rock. Rock would win against their predicted scissors move, giving us 1 point while risking -3 points if they play paper instead. However, paper is less likely given their recent loss to it.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. The psychological factor of a heavy loss (-3 points) often leads players to over-adjust and choose the direct counter to their losing position.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's go with rock. It protects against the likely scissors play while also being strong enough to maintain pressure.\n\n[move] rock Anticipating opponent will switch to scissors to counter our previous paper play, so playing rock as counter-strategy.\n"

Our opponent didn't switch to scissors as predicted, but instead stayed with an aggressive paper strategy. They've now won twice using paper-based plays (first defensively against our paper, now offensively with paper).\n\nGame Strategist: This suggests our opponent might be employing a more sophisticated strategy than we initially thought. They've demonstrated they're willing to use paper repeatedly, knowing it has the highest potential payoff.\n\nRisk Manager: We're now down 3 points and need to be careful. The opponent has shown consistency with paper plays, but this could be setting up a trap. They might expect us to play scissors now and switch to rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: However, given their success with paper so far (winning 3 points last round), there's a psychological tendency to stick with what's working. The principle of \"if it's not broken, don't fix it\" often applies in game psychology.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they play paper again, we win 1 point and start recovering\n2. If they play rock, we lose 1 point - a manageable loss\n3. If they play scissors, it's a tie\n\nRisk Manager: I agree.

However, they might be aware that we could spot this pattern and might try to break it.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's assess our position. We're down 4 points total (-3, -1 from last two rounds). We need to be strategic but can't afford to be too conservative.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given their complete avoidance of scissors so far, it seems they prefer the rock-paper dynamic. Even if they break their pattern, they're likely to stick to these two moves.\n\nGame Strategist: If they're playing paper as per pattern, scissors would win us 1 point. If they break pattern with rock, we lose 1 point. If they surprise with scissors, we tie. \n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has shown they're sophisticated enough to bait our moves. However, they've also shown a preference for higher-reward plays (using paper for 3 points).

They might be trying to show us they can use all three moves to make their strategy less predictable.\n\nRisk Manager: We're still down 4 points overall. The fact that they matched our scissors could mean:\n1. They predicted our move based on their previous rock success\n2. They're starting to play more defensively\n3.

In previous multiple-loss situations, they've often turned to paper as their recovery strategy due to its high reward potential.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Key insights:\n1. They're on a losing streak (paper \u2192 scissors)\n2. After rock losses, they've favored scissors (2/3 times)\n3. They've historically used paper to break losing streaks\n4.

In that situation, they used scissors after a rock loss, but it didn't work out.
