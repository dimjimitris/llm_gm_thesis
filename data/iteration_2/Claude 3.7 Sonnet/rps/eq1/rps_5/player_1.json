    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My best move would be scissors, which would:\n   - Win against paper if they play it a third time\n   - Tie against scissors if they switch to that\n   - Only lose if they play rock, which they've played less frequently\n\n9. Given my only success came with scissors against their paper, and they've just played paper twice, I'll choose scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After my win in round 9, they've adjusted and beaten me twice more.\n\n5. I notice they played rock in round 11 after playing paper in rounds 9-10. This could indicate they're adapting to my moves rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\n6. At this point, I need to be as unpredictable as possible.\n\n7. Looking at frequency: my opponent has played paper 4 times, scissors 4 times, and rock 3 times. Their distribution is fairly balanced.\n\n8. One approach I haven't tried is to play the move that would have lost to their previous move. This is counter-intuitive but might break any pattern they're detecting.\n\n9. Their last move was rock. The move that would lose to rock is scissors.\n\n10. Using this counter-intuitive strategy, I should play paper (which beats their previous rock).\n\n11. However, they might anticipate this obvious counter to their rock.\n\n12. I'll play rock, breaking away from obvious patterns and potentially catching them off-guard if they play scissors expecting me to play paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent sequence:\n   scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n3. I incorrectly predicted they would play scissors in the last round. Instead, they played paper and beat my rock.\n\n4. Looking at their behavior after wins:\n   - After winning in round 2, they played rock in round 3\n   - After winning in rounds 5-7, they played scissors in round 8\n   - After winning in rounds 10-11, they played scissors in round 12\n   - After winning in round 13, they played scissors in round 14\n   - After winning in round 18, they'll make their next move now\n\n5. There's a pattern: after winning, they have frequently played scissors in the next round (rounds 8, 12, 14).\n\n6. Based on this pattern, there's a good chance they might play scissors in this round.\n\n7. Additionally, they've just played paper, and they rarely play the same move twice in a row.\n\n8. If they play scissors as I predict, my rock would win.\n   If they play rock, we would tie.\n   If they play paper again, I would lose.\n\n9. Given their historical tendency to play scissors after a win, and the fact that they just played paper, scissors seems like their most likely move.\n\n10. I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent sequence:\n   paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. We just tied with rock. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - After tying in round 1, they played scissors in round 2\n   - After tying in round 3, they played scissors in round 4\n   - After tying in round 16, they played rock in round 17\n   - After tying in round 19, they'll make their next move now\n\n4. There's no strong pattern in how they respond to ties, but they played scissors twice after our first two ties.\n\n5. They've now played rock twice in a row (rounds 17 and 19), which is unusual for them.\n\n6. After playing the same move twice in a row, they typically change to a different move.\n\n7. Given that they've played rock twice, they're likely to switch to either paper or scissors.\n\n8. If they play scissors, my rock would win.\n   If they play paper, my scissors would win.\n   If they play rock again, we would tie.\n\n9. Historically, when they've played rock multiple times, they've often followed with paper (like in rounds 10 and 18).\n\n10. Given their tendency to change moves after playing the same one twice, and their historical pattern of following rock with paper, I believe they're likely to play paper in this round.\n\n11. To counter their expected paper, I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's recent sequence:\n   rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n3. They've now played rock three times in the last four rounds, which is a significant shift in their strategy.\n\n4. Looking at my scissors plays:\n   - Round 4: scissors vs scissors \u2192 Tie\n   - Round 7: scissors vs rock \u2192 Loss\n   - Round 9: scissors vs paper \u2192 Win\n   - Round 11: scissors vs rock \u2192 Loss\n   - Round 13: scissors vs rock \u2192 Loss\n   - Round 15: scissors vs paper \u2192 Win\n   - Round 20: scissors vs rock \u2192 Loss\n\n5. My scissors have lost to their rock 4 times and won against their paper 2 times.\n\n6. They seem to be countering my scissors plays effectively with rock.\n\n7. Given that they just played rock and won, they might:\n   - Stick with rock if they think I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock to counter their rock\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper to counter their expected paper\n\n8. Since they've played rock so frequently recently, and it's been working against my scissors, they might stick with it.\n\n9. If they play rock again, my paper would win.\n   If they switch to paper, my scissors would win.\n   If they switch to scissors, my rock would win.\n\n10. Given their recent rock-heavy strategy and success with it, I believe they're likely to either stick with rock or play paper expecting me to play rock.\n\n11. Between these two possibilities, paper seems more likely as it would counter my expected rock response.\n\n12. I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My paper plays have resulted in 1 win, 2 ties, and 4 losses. The opponent seems to counter my paper effectively with scissors.\n\n6. When I've won a round (as in round 21), they've often adapted in the next round to counter my expected move.\n\n7. Their recent moves show significant adaptability rather than a fixed pattern.\n\n8. After my scissors win in round 21, they correctly anticipated I would switch to paper and countered with scissors.\n\n9. Given this adaptability, they might expect me to play rock next to counter their scissors.\n\n10. If they expect rock from me, they would play paper.\n\n11. However, they might also anticipate that I'll try to be unpredictable and play scissors again, in which case they would play rock.\n\n12. Given their tendency to adapt quickly and accurately to my moves, I need to break any pattern they might be detecting.\n\n13. Since they just played scissors and won, they might expect me to play rock. But if they're thinking at a deeper level, they might expect me to play scissors anticipating their paper.\n\n14.

Their distribution is slightly weighted toward paper, which has been effective against my rock plays.\n\n8. After playing paper in round 23, they might:\n   - Stay with paper if they think I'll play rock again\n   - Switch to rock if they think I'll play scissors to counter their paper\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper to counter their expected rock\n\n9. Given that they've just won with paper against my rock, they might expect me to play scissors next to counter their paper.\n\n10. If they expect scissors from me, they would play rock.\n\n11.

My opponent's recent sequence:\n   paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. I've now lost three rounds in a row, with my opponent accurately countering all of my moves.\n\n4. My opponent seems to be extremely good at anticipating my moves and responding accordingly.\n\n5. Looking at the full game, my scissors plays have been particularly unsuccessful:\n   - 7 scissors plays: 2 wins, 1 tie, 4 losses\n   - Most of my scissors losses have been against rock\n\n6. My opponent has now played rock 8 times, scissors 7 times, and paper 9 times - a fairly balanced distribution.\n\n7.

Given their success at predicting my moves, they likely have some insight into my decision-making process.\n\n9. They might expect me to play rock next to counter their rock, in which case they would play paper.\n\n10. However, they might also think I'll try to be unpredictable and play scissors again, in which case they would stick with rock.\n\n11. At this point, I need to break free from any pattern they might be detecting in my play.\n\n12. Given that they've beaten my scissors with rock multiple times, they might not expect me to play scissors again.\n\n13. I'll play paper, which:\n    - Would beat their rock if they stick with it\n    - Would lose to their scissors if they anticipate my paper\n    - Would tie with their paper if they try to counter my expected rock\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's recent sequence:\n   scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. I've now lost four rounds in a row. My opponent seems to be extremely good at anticipating my moves.\n\n4. Looking at my paper plays throughout the game:\n   - 8 paper plays: 1 win, 3 ties, 4 losses\n   - Most of my paper losses have been against scissors\n\n5. My opponent has now played rock 8 times, scissors 8 times, and paper 9 times - maintaining a fairly balanced distribution.\n\n6. After playing scissors in round 25, they might:\n   - Stay with scissors if they think I'll play paper again\n   - Switch to rock if they think I'll play scissors to counter their scissors\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock to counter their expected rock\n\n7. Given their success at predicting my moves, I need a completely different approach.\n\n8. Instead of trying to predict their next move based on patterns, I'll try a more fundamental approach.\n\n9. Rock is statistically played most often in rock-paper-scissors by novice players, but my opponent is clearly sophisticated.\n\n10. Given that they've just played scissors and won, they might feel confident enough to play scissors again.\n\n11. If they play scissors again, my rock would win.\n    If they switch to rock, we would tie.\n    If they switch to paper, I would lose.\n\n12. At this point, breaking my losing streak is the priority, and rock gives me the best chance against their potential scissors repeat.\n\n13. I'll play rock, which also protects against a potential scissors play from them.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent sequence:\n   paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. I've now lost five rounds in a row. My opponent seems to be extraordinarily good at anticipating my moves.\n\n4. Looking at my rock plays throughout the game:\n   - 8 rock plays: 2 wins, 3 ties, 3 losses\n   - My recent rock plays have all lost to paper\n\n5. My opponent has now played rock 8 times, scissors 8 times, and paper 10 times - showing a slight preference for paper.\n\n6. After playing paper in round 26, they might:\n   - Stay with paper if they think I'll play rock again\n   - Switch to rock if they think I'll play scissors to counter their paper\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper to counter their expected rock\n\n7. Given their success at predicting my moves, I need a radically different approach.\n\n8. Looking at the full sequence of their moves, they seem to be very adaptable rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\n9. One pattern I notice: they've played paper more often than other moves, especially recently.\n\n10. If they're developing a preference for paper, scissors would be the best counter.\n\n11. However, they might anticipate this and play rock instead.\n\n12. At this point, I need to break my losing streak and be as unpredictable as possible.\n\n13. Given that they just played paper and might expect me to counter with scissors, they might play rock next.\n\n14. To counter their potential rock, I'll play paper.\n\n15. This is also a psychological move - by playing paper after just losing with rock to their paper, I'm doing something they might not expect.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's recent sequence:\n   rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. I correctly anticipated their rock play in the last round and won with paper.\n\n4. Looking at their behavior after losses:\n   - After losing in round 9, they played paper in round 10\n   - After losing in round 12, they played rock in round 13\n   - After losing in rounds 14-15, they played paper in round 16\n   - After losing in round 17, they played paper in round 18\n   - After losing in round 21, they played scissors in round 22\n   - After losing in round 27, they'll make their next move now\n\n5. There's no strong pattern in how they respond to losses, but they've frequently switched their move after losing.\n\n6.

Given their adaptability and the fact that I've just won with paper, they're likely to counter with scissors.\n\n9. If they play scissors as I expect, my rock would win.\n\n10.

After our previous ties, they've played scissors twice and rock twice.\n\n5. They've now played rock twice in a row (rounds 27 and 28), which has been unusual for them in the past.\n\n6. After playing the same move twice in a row, they typically change to a different move.\n\n7. Given that they've played rock twice, they're likely to switch to either paper or scissors.\n\n8. If they play scissors, my rock would win.\n   If they play paper, my scissors would win.\n   If they play rock again, we would tie.\n\n9. Historically, when they've played rock multiple times, they've often followed with paper (like in rounds 10 and 18).\n\n10. Given their tendency to change moves after playing the same one twice, and their historical pattern of following rock with paper, I believe they're likely to play paper in this round.\n\n11.

My opponent has now played rock 11 times, scissors 8 times, and paper 10 times - showing an increasing preference for rock.\n\n6.
