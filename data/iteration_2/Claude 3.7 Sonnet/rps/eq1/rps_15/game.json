In the absence of information, all three moves (rock, paper, scissors) have equal expected value.\n3. However, there are some psychological factors to consider:\n   - Rock is often the most common first move for beginners since it's perceived as \"strong\"\n   - If my opponent thinks strategically, they might anticipate this and play paper\n4. Given this is a one-shot game with no clear advantage, I'll make a random selection to be unpredictable.\n5. I'll choose paper as my move.

If they're following this pattern, they'll likely play scissors next.\n5. However, they might also be adapting to my moves strategically rather than following a preset pattern.\n6. They've beaten me once, so they might repeat their winning strategy and play paper again, expecting me to play rock again.\n7. Given these considerations, if they play scissors (following the cycle), I should play rock to win.\n8. If they play paper again (repeating success), I should play scissors to win.\n9.
