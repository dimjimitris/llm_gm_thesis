    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since this is our first interaction, I have no pattern to base my decision on.\n3. In rock-paper-scissors without prior information, each move has an equal 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or tying.\n4. Some players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n5. However, anticipating this and choosing paper could be overthinking - the opponent might be doing similar reasoning.\n6. Without information on opponent tendencies, I should make my move as unpredictable as possible.\n7.

If they're a strategic player, they might expect me to switch to rock (to beat their potential scissors)\n5. Given this reasoning, if they're thinking ahead, they might choose paper to beat my anticipated rock\n6. To counter this possibility, I should play scissors\n7. However, if they simply repeat their winning move (rock), my scissors would lose again\n8.

This suggests they might favor rock as their preferred move, possibly due to comfort or strategy.\n5. Given this consistent pattern, there are three possibilities:\n   a) They continue with rock for a third time (suggesting a very fixed strategy)\n   b) They realize I might expect rock again and switch to paper (to beat my anticipated rock)\n   c) They switch to scissors (to beat my previous paper move)\n6. Option (c) seems most likely - they've just lost with rock against my paper, so they may logically switch to scissors to counter my paper.\n7. To counter their anticipated scissors, I should play rock.\n8. If they're actually more predictable than I'm giving credit for and play rock again, we'd tie.\n9.
