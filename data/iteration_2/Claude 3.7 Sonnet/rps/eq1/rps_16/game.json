After losing with scissors against my rock, they might:\n   - Switch to paper to counter my rock\n   - Try something completely different to break their losing streak\n   - Continue with scissors if they're following a rigid pattern\n6. Based on their established pattern of multiple repetitions, they might switch to a new move now\n7. If they're becoming more strategic, they would expect me to play rock again since it just won\n8.

Let's analyze the complete pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 24: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 25: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 26: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 27: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 28: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n2. My opponent's complete pattern has been:\n   - scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n3. I've now won an extraordinary 18 consecutive rounds\n4. Their recent moves have maintained the rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle with remarkable consistency\n5. If they continue this cycle, rock would be next\n6. Despite the extended losing streak, they've shown no signs of breaking their pattern\n7. At this point, they appear to be completely committed to their cycle regardless of the outcome\n8. If they're still cycling, rock would be next after paper\n9. If they're trying to counter my last winning move (scissors), they would play rock\n10. Both cycle analysis and counter-strategy suggest rock as their next move\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper this round, anticipating they'll play rock either to continue their cycle or to counter my previous scissors play.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
