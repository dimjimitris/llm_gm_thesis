But if I play paper against their potential rock, I could earn 3 points.\n7. The expected value calculation would be complex without knowing opponent tendencies.\n8.

Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n13. My opponent's pattern: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n14. They've now played paper 8 out of 12 rounds (66.7%), showing an extremely strong preference.\n15. I've successfully countered their paper with scissors 5 times now.\n16. Despite repeatedly losing to scissors when playing paper, they continue this strategy.\n17. This suggests either a fixed strategy or very slow adaptation.\n18. After losing with paper to scissors, they might finally change to rock.\n19. However, their historical pattern suggests they're likely to continue with paper.\n20. Given their persistent paper strategy despite repeated losses, scissors remains effective.\n21. The risk of them adapting increases with each round, but their adaptation rate has been minimal.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again for this round, as it has been consistently effective against their paper-dominant strategy, while recognizing the increasing (but still relatively low) risk of them switching to rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n18. Round 18: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points.\n19. Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n20. Round 20: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points.\n21. My opponent's pattern: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n22. They've now played rock eight times in a row, showing an extremely stubborn commitment to this strategy.\n23. We've tied with rock four times now.\n24. After rock ties, they've previously:\n    - Switched to paper twice (after Rounds 8 and 11)\n    - Continued with rock four times (after Rounds 15, 18, and now 20)\n25. Their current pattern suggests they're extremely committed to rock, despite multiple losses to paper.\n26. Given their extraordinary persistence with rock despite significant losses, they're likely to continue with rock.\n27. If they continue with rock, my paper would win.\n28. If they finally switch to scissors, my rock would win.\n29. If they switch to paper, my scissors would win.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round, which would win against their likely continued rock play. Their demonstrated extreme persistence with strategies (first paper, now rock) makes it more probable they'll continue with rock despite losses.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After a tie with paper, they might:\n    - Continue with paper, starting a new streak\n    - Switch to scissors, anticipating I might play paper again\n    - Switch to rock, going back to their previous strategy\n26. Given their demonstrated pattern of sticking with strategies for extended periods, they might continue with paper.\n27. However, they've also shown they eventually adapt, albeit slowly.\n28.

Round 27: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n28. My opponent's pattern: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n29. They finally switched to scissors after four consecutive rock plays.\n30. This confirms they do eventually adapt their strategy after repeated losses.\n31. After losing with scissors against my rock, they might:\n    - Switch to rock to counter my expected rock play\n    - Switch to paper, anticipating I might play rock again\n    - Continue with scissors, though this seems less likely given they just lost\n32. Given their historical pattern of adaptation after losses, they're likely to change from scissors.\n33. Their most common response after losing has been to switch moves.\n34. If they switch to rock, my paper would win.\n35. If they switch to paper, my scissors would win.\n36. If they continue with scissors, my rock would win again.\n37. Based on their overall game pattern, rock has been their most consistent move recently.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round, anticipating they might switch to rock based on their historical preference for rock and tendency to change moves after losses.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Given their historical pattern after paper ties (Rounds 5, 9, 21), they've previously:\n    - Continued with paper once\n    - Switched to scissors once\n    - Switched to paper once\n33. There's no clear pattern after paper ties.\n34. Looking at their broader pattern, they tend to stick with moves for multiple rounds.\n35. If they continue with paper, my scissors would win.\n36.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
