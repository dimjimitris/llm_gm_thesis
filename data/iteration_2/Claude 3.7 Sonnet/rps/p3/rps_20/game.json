My recent performance:\n   - I've lost 10 rounds in a row\n   - All conventional and unconventional strategies have failed\n   - I need a completely fresh approach\n\n4. Looking at their overall pattern:\n   - Rock is their most common move (40% of rounds)\n   - They've won against my scissors with rock multiple times\n   - They seem to anticipate my thinking process regardless of my approach\n\n5. After winning with rock against my scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with rock if they think I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to paper anticipating I'll play rock to counter their rock\n   - Switch to scissors thinking I'll play paper to counter their expected paper\n\n6. Given my extensive losing streak, I need to:\n   - Acknowledge that they've been able to predict my moves consistently\n   - Consider that any complex reasoning I use might be anticipated\n   - Try a simple, direct approach\n\n7. The direct counter to their rock would be paper\n   \n8. However, they've consistently anticipated my logical moves\n   \n9. They might expect me to play paper to counter their rock\n   \n10. If they expect paper, they would play scissors\n    \n11. After 10 consecutive losses, I need a fundamentally different approach\n    \n12. Looking at the overall game, paper has the highest potential reward (+3) when it wins\n    \n13. Given the length of my losing streak, maximizing potential gain is important\n    \n14. Despite the risk, paper seems the most strategic choice for potential reward\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper After ten consecutive losses, I need to focus on the move with the highest potential reward. My opponent just played rock, and paper beats rock for +3 points. While they might anticipate this and play scissors, I need to prioritize the possibility of a significant gain. They've shown remarkable ability to predict my moves, but at this point, I need to make the direct counter to their last move and accept the risk. Paper gives me the best chance to break this streak with a meaningful win.\n"
