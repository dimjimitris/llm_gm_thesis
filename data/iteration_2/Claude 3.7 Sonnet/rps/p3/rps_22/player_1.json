Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The payoffs are asymmetric: paper beating rock gives 3 points while the other winning combinations give only 1 point.\n4. Since paper has the highest potential reward (3 points for beating rock), there's a slight incentive for opponents to play paper.\n5. If I expect my opponent might favor paper, scissors would be a good counter.\n6. However, since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have data on their tendencies.\n7. Given the asymmetric payoffs, I should consider playing scissors since it counters the potentially high-reward paper move.\n8.

However, they might also recognize their own pattern and deliberately break it.\n\n8. If they play rock (consistent with their pattern after paper): I should play paper (+3)\n9. If they play paper (repeating their last move): I should play scissors (+1)\n10. If they play scissors (breaking pattern, but used after ties before): I should play rock (+1)\n\n11.

When players lose with scissors, they often switch to rock next (to avoid another scissors loss)\n\n7.

This suggests they recognized I was detecting their pattern and deliberately changed strategy.\n\n5. After they play scissors:\n   - After Round 3 (scissors), they played rock in Round 4\n   - After Round 12 (scissors), they played rock in Round 13\n   - After Round 15 (scissors), they played paper in Round 16 (breaking pattern)\n   - After Round 17 (scissors), they might be less predictable\n\n6. After I lose a round:\n   - After Round 3 loss, I played rock in Round 4\n   - After Round 7 loss, I played scissors in Round 8\n   - After Round 8 loss, I played scissors in Round 9\n   - After Round 13 loss, I played rock in Round 14\n   - After Round 17 loss, I need to be unpredictable\n\n7. If they play rock (returning to their pattern after scissors): I should play paper (+3)\n8. If they play paper (breaking pattern again): I should play scissors (+1)\n9. If they play scissors (repeating their last move): I should play rock (+1)\n\n10. Given that they just broke a very consistent pattern, they're likely trying to be less predictable or are anticipating that I'll counter their historical pattern.\n\n11. They might expect me to play rock after losing to scissors (as I've done twice before).\n\n12. If they expect rock from me, they would play paper.\n\n13. Rock would be the optimal counter to counter their potential scissors play, while also protecting against them repeating scissors (which they've rarely done).\n\n[move] rock\n"

My current total score is +3 points.\n\n3. My opponent's moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They've now played rock 13 times, paper 8 times, and scissors 8 times\n   - We've had another rock-rock tie\n\n4. After rock-rock ties:\n   - After Round 2 tie, they played scissors in Round 3\n   - After Round 4 tie, they played paper in Round 5\n   - After Round 14 tie, they played scissors in Round 15\n   - After Round 25 tie, they played rock in Round 26\n   - After Round 26 tie, they played scissors in Round 27\n   - After Round 29 tie, scissors appears most common after rock-rock ties\n\n5. Looking at their recent behavior:\n   - They played rock in Round 28 and Round 29\n   - After consecutive rock plays, they often switch to scissors\n   - They've played rock 5 times in the last 7 rounds\n\n6. If they play rock (triple rock again): I should play paper (+3)\n7. If they play paper (less common after rock-rock ties): I should play scissors (+1)\n8. If they play scissors (common after rock-rock ties): I should play rock (+1)\n\n9. Given their pattern after rock-rock ties (scissors is most common) and the psychological pressure to change after consecutive identical moves, scissors seems their most likely move.\n\n10. Rock would be the optimal counter to their expected scissors play.\n\n[move] rock\n"
