Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is my first move against a fresh player, so I have no prior information about their strategy or patterns.\n2. In rock-paper-scissors, without any prior information, no single move has an inherent advantage.\n3. The payoff structure shows that paper (beating rock) gives the highest reward of 3 points.\n4. However, if my opponent anticipates this and plays scissors, I would lose 1 point.\n5. Rock is a common first move for many players as it feels \"strong\" psychologically.\n6. If I expect my opponent might play rock first, then paper would be optimal.\n7. But I also need to consider that my opponent might be thinking through this same reasoning.\n8. Given the higher reward for paper (3 points vs 1 point for other winning moves), there's slightly more incentive to play paper.\n9. Without any other information, I'll choose paper as it has the highest potential reward.\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

If they continue with scissors: rock wins (+1), paper loses (-1), scissors ties\n   \n8. If they finally switch to paper: rock loses (-3), paper ties, scissors wins (+1)\n\n9. Given the extreme consistency they've shown, there are two rational approaches:\n   - Continue exploiting their pattern with rock\n   - Anticipate they must eventually adapt and play scissors to counter their expected paper\n\n10. The risk of them switching to paper has increased, and the loss from rock vs paper (-3) is greater than the gain from rock vs scissors (+1).\n\n11. After 5 consecutive scissors plays that lost to rock, this would be the logical point for them to finally adapt.\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors for this round to anticipate their potential switch to paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's moves have been: scissors (9x) \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They have now played scissors in 9 out of 11 rounds\n   - They've played scissors in 6 consecutive rounds\n   - Their pattern seems extremely consistent despite losses\n\n3. I switched to scissors in round 11 anticipating they might finally adapt, but they played scissors again.\n\n4. This suggests they:\n   - Are using a heavily biased strategy favoring scissors\n   - May not be adapting based on game outcomes\n   - Could be using a random strategy with strong bias\n\n5. Given their persistent scissors play:\n   - When I play rock against their scissors, I consistently win (+1)\n   - When I play scissors against their scissors, we tie (0)\n   - When I play paper against their scissors, I lose (-1)\n\n6. The rational strategy against an opponent who plays scissors with such high probability is to play rock.\n\n7. While there remains a possibility they might finally switch to paper, their demonstrated behavior over 11 rounds suggests this is less likely than them continuing with scissors.\n\n8. Expected values based on their observed frequency:\n   - Rock: Highest expected value against their demonstrated pattern\n   - Scissors: Second best (ties against their frequent scissors)\n   - Paper: Lowest expected value against their pattern\n\n9.

My opponent's pattern has finally changed:\n   - After 6 consecutive scissors plays, they've now played rock\n   - This could indicate they're finally adapting their strategy\n   - It also matches their earlier pattern from rounds 3-5 where they mirrored my previous move\n\n3. Possible strategies they might be using:\n   - They could be starting to mirror my moves (I played rock in round 12, they played rock)\n   - They might be rotating through moves more deliberately now\n   - They could be finally adapting to counter my rock plays\n\n4. If they're mirroring my last move, they'll play rock again (since I just played rock)\n\n5. If they're adapting strategically, they're most likely to play paper next to counter my frequent rock plays\n\n6.

My opponent has finally made a significant adaptation:\n   - After predominantly playing scissors, they've played paper when I returned to rock\n   - This suggests they've been tracking my moves and noticed my tendency to play rock\n   - This is only the second time they've played paper in the entire game\n\n3. Their pattern now appears more strategic than I previously assessed:\n   - They played scissors until I consistently countered with rock and won\n   - They occasionally matched my moves leading to ties\n   - They've now countered my rock with paper for a high-value win\n\n4. This suggests they might be:\n   - Adapting their strategy based on my recent moves\n   - Setting up patterns to make me predictable\n   - Making more thoughtful choices than their early scissors bias suggested\n\n5. If they're now strategically adapting:\n   - They might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper\n   - They could play rock to counter my expected scissors\n   - Or they might play paper again, anticipating I'll avoid rock after my loss\n\n6. The key question is whether this paper play represents a genuine strategy shift or just a temporary deviation.\n\n7. Given they've now demonstrated more strategic thinking, I should assume they're capable of anticipating my counter-moves.\n\n8. If I play scissors to counter their paper, they may be expecting this and play rock.\n\n9. If I play paper, they might revert to scissors (their most common move).\n\n10. If I play rock again, they might continue with paper to exploit my persistence.\n\n11. Since they've shown they can adapt, but still have a historical preference for scissors, paper is actually a risky but potentially high-reward move.\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors for this round, anticipating either their continued paper play or a reversion to their scissors preference.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 14: paper\n   - Round 15: rock\n   - Round 16: scissors\n   - Round 17: paper\n   - Round 18: scissors\n\n3. This breaks the rotation pattern I thought I had identified. Their play is now:\n   scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n4. Looking at their overall strategy:\n   - They played scissors in 12 out of 18 rounds (67% of the time)\n   - They've now won 6 consecutive rounds against me\n   - They appear to be mixing strategic adaptation with their scissors bias\n\n5. Their behavior suggests they might be:\n   - Primarily biased toward scissors but occasionally using other moves strategically\n   - Adapting to counter my expected counter-moves\n   - Using scissors as a default when uncertain\n\n6. Given their strong historical preference for scissors and recent return to it:\n   - If they play scissors again (their most frequent move): rock wins (+1), paper loses (-1), scissors ties\n   - If they play paper (to counter expected rock): rock loses (-3), paper ties, scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they play rock (to counter expected scissors): rock ties, paper wins (+3), scissors loses (-1)\n\n7. Since they've returned to scissors despite breaking their rotation pattern, they may:\n   - Be reverting to their default scissors bias\n   - Be trying to condition me to play rock so they can counter with paper\n   - Be mixing strategies to remain unpredictable\n\n8. Given they've beaten me 6 rounds in a row, I need to break this pattern with a less predictable approach.\n\n9. Rock has historically been my most successful move against them, but they've recently countered it with paper.\n\n10. Their return to scissors suggests rock might once again be effective.\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's most recent sequence:\n   - Round 15: rock\n   - Round 16: scissors\n   - Round 17: paper\n   - Round 18: scissors\n   - Round 19: scissors\n\n3. Overall pattern analysis:\n   - They've now played scissors in 13 out of 19 rounds (68%)\n   - They reverted to scissors in rounds 18-19 after their brief strategic adaptation\n   - They've played scissors consecutively again, reminiscent of their early game strategy\n\n4. Their return to scissors suggests:\n   - A strong default preference for scissors\n   - Possible abandonment of their rotation strategy\n   - A reversion to their earlier, less strategic play\n\n5. Given this pattern, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors, their dominant move\n   - Try to counter my rock (which just beat their scissors) with paper\n   - Return to a more strategic approach after this loss\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after previous losses:\n   - After losing to rock in rounds 2, 6, 8-10, they eventually adapted with paper in round 14\n   - This suggests they might adapt again after this recent loss\n\n7. If they play scissors again (continuing their recent pattern): rock wins (+1), paper loses (-1), scissors ties\n\n8. If they play paper (adapting to counter my rock): rock loses (-3), paper ties, scissors wins (+1)\n\n9. If they play rock (trying a new approach): rock ties, paper wins (+3), scissors loses (-1)\n\n10. Given their strong historical preference for scissors but tendency to adapt after losses, I should be prepared for either scissors again or a switch to paper.\n\n11. Their most likely move is paper to counter my recent successful rock play.\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors for this round to counter their likely paper play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've now played scissors in 14 out of 20 rounds (70%), and in 3 consecutive rounds.\n\n4. This strong return to their scissors bias suggests:\n   - Their brief strategic adaptation (rounds 14-17) may have been abandoned\n   - They're reverting to their default scissors-dominant strategy\n   - They may be trying to establish a pattern to make me predictable again\n\n5. Given their current pattern and history:\n   - When they play scissors multiple times in a row, rock has been my most successful counter\n   - After I play rock successfully, they sometimes adapt with paper\n   - They seem to have a strong preference for scissors regardless of outcomes\n\n6. Looking at their response patterns:\n   - After I played scissors in round 20 (tie), they might:\n     - Continue with scissors (their default)\n     - Switch to rock (to beat scissors)\n     - Switch to paper (less likely based on their pattern)\n\n7.

They've now played scissors in 15 out of 21 rounds (71%), and in 4 consecutive rounds.\n\n4.

Historically, when I've had multiple consecutive wins with rock:\n   - They sometimes continued with scissors despite losing (rounds 8-10)\n   - They eventually adapted with paper (round 14) after multiple losses\n   - They've recently reverted to scissors despite this history\n\n8.

They've now played scissors in 16 out of 22 rounds (73%), and in 5 consecutive rounds.\n\n4. This pattern is remarkably consistent:\n   - Their scissors bias is extremely strong and persistent\n   - They've continued with scissors despite losing to rock 3 times in a row\n   - They appear resistant to strategic adaptation\n\n5. Historical precedent in this game:\n   - They played scissors in rounds 1-3, 6-11, 13, 16, 18-22 (16 rounds total)\n   - They played rock in rounds 4, 12, 15 (3 rounds total)\n   - They played paper in rounds 5, 14, 17 (3 rounds total)\n   - After losing to rock in rounds 8-10, they continued with scissors in round 11\n   - They eventually adapted with paper in round 14, but have since reverted to scissors\n\n6. Despite my 3 consecutive wins with rock, their strong bias suggests:\n   - They may continue with scissors despite the losing streak\n   - They might finally adapt with paper (as they did in round 14)\n   - Their adaptation threshold appears to be higher than 3 consecutive losses\n\n7. Given their demonstrated behavior:\n   - If they continue with scissors (their strong default): rock wins (+1), paper loses (-1), scissors ties\n   - If they adapt with paper (to counter my rock): rock loses (-3), paper ties, scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock (least likely based on pattern): rock ties, paper wins (+3), scissors loses (-1)\n\n8. After 3 consecutive losses to rock, the probability they finally adapt increases, but their strong bias still favors scissors.\n\n9. The decision comes down to whether they'll finally adapt or continue their default behavior.\n\n10. Given their extremely strong scissors bias throughout the game, and previous instances where they've continued with scissors despite multiple losses, rock remains the highest expected value play.\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Their adaptation threshold appears to be around 3 consecutive losses before they change strategy.\n\n6. Given this pattern, they might:\n   - Continue with paper, expecting me to play rock again\n   - Return to scissors, their default move\n   - Try rock, anticipating I might switch to scissors to counter their paper\n\n7. Based on their historical pattern after playing paper:\n   - In round 15 (after paper in round 14), they played rock\n   - This suggests they might follow paper with rock again\n\n8.

After briefly adapting with paper in round 23, they've immediately reverted to scissors in round 24.\n\n4. This reinforces their extremely strong scissors bias:\n   - They've now played scissors in 17 out of 24 rounds (71%)\n   - They appear to make brief strategic adaptations but quickly revert to scissors\n   - Their default strategy seems to be scissors regardless of outcomes\n\n5. Their pattern suggests:\n   - A strong preference for scissors as their default move\n   - Brief tactical adaptations when they lose multiple times in a row\n   - Quick reversion to scissors after these adaptations\n\n6. After playing paper and then reverting to scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (their strong default)\n   - Try paper again (since it worked in round 23)\n   - Switch to rock (least likely based on their pattern)\n\n7. If they play scissors again (their strong default): rock wins (+1), paper loses (-1), scissors ties\n\n8. If they play paper (tactical adaptation): rock loses (-3), paper ties, scissors wins (+1)\n\n9. If they play rock (least likely): rock ties, paper wins (+3), scissors loses (-1)\n\n10. Given their demonstrated strong bias for scissors and quick reversion to it after adaptations, rock remains the highest expected value play.\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's most recent sequence:\n   - Round 22: scissors\n   - Round 23: paper\n   - Round 24: scissors\n   - Round 25: scissors\n   - Round 26: rock\n\n3. This is an interesting development:\n   - After reverting to scissors in rounds 24-25, they've now played rock\n   - This breaks their usual pattern of playing scissors multiple times\n   - They might be adopting a more varied strategy\n\n4. Looking at previous instances where they played rock:\n   - Round 4: They played rock (after 3 scissors plays)\n   - Round 12: They played rock (after a mix of moves)\n   - Round 15: They played rock (after paper in round 14)\n   - Round 26: They played rock (after scissors in rounds 24-25)\n\n5. There's no clear pattern to when they choose rock, but it appears to be their second most frequent move.\n\n6. After playing rock in previous rounds:\n   - After round 4 rock, they played paper in round 5\n   - After round 12 rock, they played scissors in round 13\n   - After round 15 rock, they played scissors in round 16\n   - This suggests they might play either paper or scissors after rock\n\n7. If they play scissors (reverting to default): rock wins (+1), paper loses (-1), scissors ties\n\n8. If they play paper (following one of their patterns after rock): rock loses (-3), paper ties, scissors wins (+1)\n\n9. If they play rock again (least likely based on history): rock ties, paper wins (+3), scissors loses (-1)\n\n10. Given their varied follow-ups to rock plays and their overall tendency to play scissors, I need to make a strategic choice.\n\n11. Paper would be the optimal play if they continue with rock, but this is their least frequent pattern.\n\n12. Scissors would be optimal if they switch to paper, which they've done after rock before.\n\n13. Based on their overall game pattern and the fact that they rarely play rock twice in a row, they're most likely to switch to either scissors or paper.\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors for this round, anticipating they might switch to paper (which follows their pattern after rock in round 4).\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This sequence reveals an interesting pattern:\n   - They played rock \u2192 paper in rounds 26-27\n   - This matches their pattern from rounds 4-5 (rock \u2192 paper)\n   - They appear to be cycling through moves more deliberately now\n\n4.

After playing paper in previous rounds:\n   - After round 5 paper, they played scissors in round 6\n   - After round 14 paper, they played rock in round 15\n   - After round 17 paper, they played scissors in round 18\n   - After round 23 paper, they played scissors in round 24\n   \n6.
