They played scissors yet again, and my rock counter won. My opponent has now played scissors in 10 of the last 13 rounds, showing an extremely strong preference despite losing to rock multiple times.\n\nThis persistent scissors strategy despite repeated losses suggests either:\n1. They're trying to establish a very strong pattern to set up a trap\n2. They have a genuine bias toward playing scissors\n3. They're testing if I'll eventually change my counter strategy\n\nGiven that they've lost multiple times to the same counter move but still continue with scissors, they might finally adapt and play paper to beat my expected rock. However, their pattern so far suggests they may stubbornly continue with scissors.\n\nSince they've shown such strong scissors preference but have occasionally adapted when needed, I'll prepare for their potential adaptation while recognizing their scissors bias.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
