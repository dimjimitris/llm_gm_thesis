Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The payoff matrix shows different point values: paper beating rock gives 3 points (highest reward), while rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give only 1 point each.\n3. Since paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), it might be a good first move.\n4. However, if the opponent also reasons this way, they might choose scissors to counter paper.\n5. Without prior information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to make a strategic choice.\n6. In the first round against an unknown opponent, rock is often considered a psychologically \"safe\" opening move.\n7. But I should prioritize expected value - paper has the highest potential gain.\n8. The potential loss from playing paper (-1 if opponent plays scissors) is less severe than the potential loss from playing rock (-3 if opponent plays paper).\n9. Therefore, paper offers the best risk-reward ratio in this situation.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Alternatively, they might stick with rock, thinking I'll expect them to change and thus change my move.\n5. Since paper gave me a good outcome, my opponent might expect me to repeat it, making scissors their logical choice.\n6. If I anticipate they'll play scissors, my best response would be rock.\n7. However, if they're thinking multiple levels ahead, they might expect me to switch to rock and thus play paper themselves.\n8. Given that this is just the second round, most players tend to make a simple adaptation from the first round rather than complex multi-level reasoning.\n9. The most straightforward adjustment for my opponent would be to counter my previous winning move (paper) by playing scissors.\n10. Therefore, playing rock would be my best response to counter their likely scissors play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"
