Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My winning streak has been broken, and my total score is now +4 points.\n\n3. My opponent's complete sequence has been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. \n\n4. Interestingly, they broke their established pattern in the last round. Instead of playing rock as their pattern would suggest, they played scissors. This indicates they've finally adapted their strategy.\n\n5. Looking at their last few moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors, they've deviated from their previous cycle.\n\n6. They might be trying to counter my moves directly now. Since I played paper and they countered with scissors successfully, they might expect me to play rock next and counter with paper.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might return to their original pattern and play rock, or they might stick with scissors since it worked.\n\n8. Given that they just broke their pattern for the first time in several rounds, it's difficult to predict their next move with confidence.\n\n9. If they're now actively trying to counter my expected moves, they would likely play paper expecting me to play rock.\n\n10. Considering this uncertainty, I should play scissors:\n    - It would beat their paper if they're trying to counter my expected rock\n    - It would tie against their scissors if they repeat their last move\n    - It would lose to rock if they return to their pattern or try to counter my scissors\n\n11. Since paper has the highest risk (losing 3 points against scissors), and scissors has a good chance of winning or tying, scissors seems to be the most balanced choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I won the last round, bringing my total score to +5 points.\n\n3. My opponent's complete sequence has been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper.\n\n4. Looking at their last few moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, they seem to be alternating between paper and scissors recently.\n\n5. If they continue this alternating pattern, their next move would be scissors.\n\n6. However, they might also be trying to be less predictable after I successfully countered their paper with scissors in the last round.\n\n7. Since I've played scissors twice in the last three rounds and won with it both times, they might expect me to play scissors again and counter with rock.\n\n8. Alternatively, they might think I'll expect scissors based on their recent alternating pattern, and that I'll play rock, so they might play paper to counter.\n\n9. Given these possibilities, I need to consider which move gives me the best chances:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors (continuing their alternation), I win (+1)\n   - If I play rock and they play paper (trying to counter my expected rock), I lose (-3)\n   - If I play rock and they play rock, we tie (0)\n\n10. Rock seems to be a balanced choice here. It counters their potential scissors if they continue alternating, and while it risks losing to paper, the opponent's recent moves suggest scissors is slightly more likely than paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

The last round ended in a tie, with my total score remaining at +5 points.\n\n3. My opponent's previous alternating pattern of scissors \u2192 paper was broken, as they played rock instead of the expected scissors.\n\n4. This suggests they might be trying to predict my moves more actively now. They correctly anticipated I would play rock.\n\n5. Looking at their complete sequence, there's no clear pattern anymore. They might be adapting to my moves or trying to be more random.\n\n6. After a tie with rock, a common strategy is to stick with the same move, thinking the opponent will change. If they follow this logic, they might play rock again.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might expect me to play paper to beat their expected rock, and counter with scissors.\n\n8. Given the uncertainty and the fact that they just played rock, there's a good chance they'll play either rock again or scissors (to counter my potential paper).\n\n9. Paper would beat their rock if they repeat it, but lose to scissors if they anticipate my paper.\n\n10. Scissors would tie against their scissors if they try to counter my expected paper, but lose to rock if they repeat it.\n\n11. Rock would beat their scissors if they try to counter my expected paper, but tie against their rock if they repeat it.\n\n12. Considering the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential gain (+3 for beating rock) but also risk (-1 for losing to scissors). Rock is the safest option as it would at worst tie.\n\n13. Since I'm already ahead in points, I'll go with paper which gives me the best chance of increasing my lead substantially if they play rock again, while accepting the moderate risk of losing 1 point if they play scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper\n\n[move] paper\n"

We've now had six consecutive ties, which confirms my theory that the opponent is deliberately mirroring my moves.\n\n3. The pattern is now undeniable: whatever I play, they play the same, resulting in a tie.\n\n4. This strategy makes sense for them as I'm currently ahead by +5 points, so maintaining ties preserves their deficit rather than risking falling further behind.\n\n5. If they continue this mirroring strategy, then my choice for this round doesn't affect the immediate outcome (it will be another tie).\n\n6. However, there's always the possibility that they might break the pattern in this round, thinking I've become complacent with the tie situation.\n\n7. Given that we just played scissors, if they were to break the pattern, they would most likely play rock to beat my expected scissors.\n\n8. If I expect them to play rock (breaking the pattern), I should play paper.\n\n9. But the overwhelming evidence suggests they'll continue mirroring, making another tie the most likely outcome regardless of what I play.\n\n10.

Let's review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n\n2. We've now had seven consecutive ties. My total score remains at +5 points.\n\n3. The mirroring pattern continues to be consistent: the opponent is matching my moves exactly, resulting in ties.\n\n4. At this point, it's virtually certain that the opponent is deliberately mirroring my moves to maintain the current score difference.\n\n5. Since we're approaching the end of the game (assuming a standard number of rounds), their strategy makes sense - they're preventing me from increasing my lead.\n\n6. Given this consistent mirroring, my choice for this round will almost certainly result in another tie.\n\n7. However, there's always a small chance they might finally break the pattern, thinking I've become predictable or complacent.\n\n8. Since we just played rock, if they were to break the pattern, they would most likely play paper to beat my expected rock.\n\n9. If I expect them to play paper (breaking the pattern), I should play scissors.\n\n10. But the overwhelming evidence suggests they'll continue mirroring, making another tie the most likely outcome regardless of what I play.\n\n11. Since the mirroring pattern is extremely strong after seven consecutive ties, I'll play paper this time:\n    - If they continue mirroring, it will be another tie\n    - If they finally break the pattern and play scissors (anticipating my paper), I'll lose only 1 point\n    - If they break with rock (thinking I'll play scissors), I'll win 3 points, but this seems highly unlikely given their consistent strategy\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper\n\n[move] paper\n"

The mirroring pattern has finally been broken! I won the last round, increasing my total score to +8 points.\n\n3. This is a significant development - after seven consecutive ties, my opponent played rock while I played paper.\n\n4. There are several possible explanations:\n   - They might have accidentally broken their mirroring strategy\n   - They might have intentionally changed their strategy, thinking I would notice the pattern and try to exploit it\n   - They might have expected me to play scissors (following paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors) and tried to counter with rock\n\n5. Now that the mirroring pattern is broken, the opponent's next move becomes much harder to predict.\n\n6. They might return to mirroring to prevent further losses.\n   \n7. Alternatively, they might try to recover points by playing more aggressively.\n\n8. Since I just played paper and won against their rock, they might expect me to play paper again (since it worked) and counter with scissors.\n\n9. Or they might think I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper, and play rock to counter my scissors.\n\n10. Given this uncertainty after the pattern break, I need to make a strategic choice:\n    - If they return to mirroring, they'll play whatever I play\n    - If they try to counter my previous successful paper, they'll play scissors\n    - If they try to be one step ahead, anticipating I'll play scissors, they'll play rock\n\n11. Considering these possibilities, I'll play rock:\n    - If they return to mirroring, we'll tie\n    - If they play scissors to counter my expected paper, I'll win (+1 point)\n    - If they play paper to beat my expected rock, I'll lose (-3 points), but this seems less likely given they just played rock\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

After the mirroring pattern broke in round 19, we've now had two rounds with decisive outcomes. My total score is now +5 points again.\n\n3. Looking at the last two rounds:\n   - Round 19: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n\n4. This suggests they might be adopting a new strategy where they play what would have beaten their previous move. In round 19 they played rock, so in round 20 they played paper (which beats rock).\n\n5. If they continue this pattern, since they played paper in round 20, they might play scissors in round 21 (which beats paper).\n\n6. Alternatively, they might be trying to establish a new pattern to confuse me, or they might return to the mirroring strategy that worked for seven consecutive rounds.\n\n7. Given that the mirroring strategy broke so recently, and we've only seen two rounds of a potential new pattern, there's considerable uncertainty.\n\n8. If they play scissors as predicted by the \"beat my previous move\" pattern, my best response is rock.\n\n9. If they return to mirroring, they'll play whatever I play.\n\n10. If they're trying to stay one step ahead, they might anticipate my rock (to counter their expected scissors) and play paper.\n\n11. Considering these possibilities and the fact that the opponent seems to be changing strategies, I'll play scissors:\n    - If they play scissors following the \"beat my previous move\" pattern, we'll tie\n    - If they return to mirroring, we'll tie\n    - If they play rock anticipating my scissors, I'll lose (-1 point)\n    - If they play paper thinking I'll play rock, I'll win (+1 point)\n\n12. This is a balanced move that protects against multiple strategies while giving me a chance to win.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We're back to a tie after the brief deviation from the mirroring pattern. My total score remains at +5 points.\n\n3. The last three rounds show an interesting sequence:\n   - Round 19: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n\n4. This suggests they might have returned to the mirroring strategy in the last round, or it could be a coincidence.\n\n5. If they've returned to mirroring, they'll play whatever I play in this round.\n\n6. If they're following the \"beat my previous move\" pattern, since they played scissors in round 21, they might play rock in round 22 (which beats scissors).\n\n7. Given the history of this game where they mirrored for seven consecutive rounds, there's a good chance they might be returning to that strategy.\n\n8. Since we're near the end of the game (assuming a standard number of rounds), and I'm ahead by +5 points, they have an incentive to try to win rounds rather than tie.\n\n9. If they're trying to win and think I'll play rock (to counter their expected rock), they might play paper.\n\n10. Given this complex mix of possibilities, I need to make a strategic choice that balances potential outcomes.\n\n11.

The mirroring pattern that dominated rounds 12-18 has definitely been broken, and the opponent's strategy has become less predictable.\n\n5. Looking at the opponent's most recent moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors, there's no clear pattern.\n\n6. Since I just played rock and won against their scissors, they might expect me to play rock again (since it worked) and counter with paper.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might think I'll anticipate their paper and play scissors, so they might play rock to counter.\n\n8. Given that the game is likely approaching its final rounds and I'm ahead by +6 points, the opponent has a strong incentive to try to win rounds.\n\n9. The safest approach for me would be to maintain my lead by avoiding large losses. The move with the least potential loss is scissors (which loses only 1 point to rock).\n\n10. However, if they're trying to maximize gains, they might play paper to beat my expected rock (giving them +3 points).\n\n11.

But this doesn't hold consistently across all recent rounds.\n\n6. Since I just played scissors and lost to their rock, they might expect me to play rock next (to counter their expected rock) and counter with paper.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might think I'll play paper to beat their expected rock, and counter with scissors.\n\n8.

Looking at the opponent's most recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, there's still no clear pattern.\n\n5. However, I've now lost two rounds in a row, which suggests the opponent might be developing a successful counter-strategy against me.\n\n6. Since I just played paper and lost to their scissors, they might expect me to play rock next (to counter their expected scissors) and counter with paper.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might think I'll play scissors to beat their expected paper, and counter with rock.\n\n8. Given that I've lost two rounds in a row and my lead has been reduced to +4 points, I need to be more cautious.\n\n9. The opponent seems to be anticipating my moves successfully in recent rounds. They might be detecting a pattern in my play or effectively countering my strategy.\n\n10. Breaking any pattern I might have established, I'll play rock:\n    - If they play scissors again (which they just played successfully), I'll win (+1 point)\n    - If they play rock (anticipating my scissors), we'll tie\n    - If they play paper (anticipating my rock), I'll lose (-3 points)\n\n11. While this move has the highest potential loss, it also directly counters their most recent successful move (scissors). Given that they've played scissors twice in the last three rounds, this seems like a reasonable calculated risk.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

I've now lost three rounds in a row, and my total score has dropped to +1 point. I'm still ahead, but barely.\n\n3. The last seven rounds show this sequence:\n   - Round 19: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 24: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 25: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n\n4. Looking at the opponent's most recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, they appear to be successfully countering my moves.\n\n5. Their last three plays (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper) form a classic rock-paper-scissors cycle, which might be coincidental or strategic.\n\n6. Since I've lost three rounds in a row with different moves each time, the opponent seems to be effectively predicting and countering my strategy.\n\n7. Given that I just played rock and lost to their paper, they might expect me to play scissors next (to counter their expected paper) and counter with rock.\n\n8. With my lead nearly gone, I need to break this losing streak. The opponent has successfully countered rock with paper, scissors with rock, and paper with scissors in the last three rounds.\n\n9. Instead of trying to directly counter their last move, I'll try to anticipate their counter-strategy. If they're following a pattern of countering what they think I'll play next, I need to disrupt this.\n\n10. If they expect me to play scissors (to counter their paper), they'll play rock. To counter this, I should play paper.\n\n11. I'll play paper:\n    - If they play rock (anticipating my scissors), I'll win (+3 points)\n    - If they play paper (continuing their cycle), we'll tie\n    - If they play scissors (anticipating my paper), I'll lose (-1 point)\n\n12. This move balances potential gain against limited loss, while attempting to break the pattern of the opponent successfully countering my moves.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper\n\n[move] paper\n"

I won the last round, breaking my losing streak and increasing my total score to +4 points.\n\n3. The last four rounds show a clear sequence:\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 24: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 25: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 26: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n\n4. My opponent had been successfully countering my moves for three rounds, but I broke that pattern in the last round by correctly anticipating their rock.\n\n5. Looking at the opponent's most recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, they completed a full cycle and returned to rock.\n\n6. Since I just played paper and won against their rock, they might expect me to play paper again (since it worked) and counter with scissors.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might think I'll anticipate their scissors and play rock, so they might play paper to counter.\n\n8. The game appears to be in its final rounds, and with my lead at +4 points, I need to be strategic about protecting this advantage.\n\n9. Given the complex mind game that's developed, I need to consider what the opponent is most likely to do after losing the last round:\n   - They might play scissors to counter my expected paper\n   - They might play paper to counter my expected rock (if they think I'll anticipate their scissors)\n   - They might play rock again, thinking I'll overthink and play scissors expecting their paper\n\n10. Considering all factors, I'll play rock:\n    - If they play scissors (countering my expected paper), I'll win (+1 point)\n    - If they play paper (countering my expected rock), I'll lose (-3 points)\n    - If they play rock again (thinking I'll overthink), we'll tie\n\n11. This move protects against their most likely counter-strategy (scissors to beat my expected paper repeat) while accepting the risk of a paper counter.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

I won the last round, increasing my total score to +5 points. This is my second win in a row after breaking the previous losing streak.\n\n3. The last five rounds show this sequence:\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 24: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 25: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 26: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 27: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n\n4. My opponent's most recent moves were: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. There's no clear pattern here, though they do seem to cycle through the three options.\n\n5. Since I just played rock and won against their scissors, they might expect me to play rock again (since it worked) and counter with paper.\n\n6. Alternatively, they might think I'll anticipate their paper and play scissors, so they might play rock to counter.\n\n7. The game is likely in its final rounds, and with my lead at +5 points, protecting this advantage remains important.\n\n8.

This move completes a paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors sequence from my side, which might seem predictable, but it's actually strategic because:\n    - It counters their likely paper play (if they expect me to repeat rock)\n    - If I lose, it's only by 1 point (vs. 3 points if I played paper and lost)\n    - It keeps me unpredictable by using all three options\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The last round ended in a tie, with my total score remaining at +5 points.\n\n3. The last six rounds show this sequence:\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 24: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 25: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 26: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 27: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 28: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n\n4. My opponent's most recent moves were: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors. They played scissors twice in a row in the last two rounds.\n\n5. Since we both just played scissors and tied, they might expect me to play rock next (to beat their expected scissors) and counter with paper.\n\n6. Alternatively, they might switch to rock themselves, thinking I'll play scissors again or paper to counter their expected rock.\n\n7. The game is likely in its final rounds, and with my lead at +5 points, protecting this advantage remains important.\n\n8. Given that we're near the end of the game, the opponent might take bigger risks to try to overcome my lead, potentially favoring paper plays (which have the highest reward of +3 points).\n\n9. Considering my recent sequence of paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, if they think I'm cycling predictably, they'd expect me to play paper next and might counter with scissors.\n\n10.

I won the last round, increasing my total score to +6 points. This is another win after a tie, continuing my positive momentum.\n\n3. The last seven rounds show this sequence:\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 24: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 25: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 26: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 27: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 28: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 29: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n\n4. My opponent's most recent moves were: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors. They've played scissors three times in a row, which is unusual and suggests they might be trying to establish a pattern to trick me.\n\n5. Since I just played rock and won against their scissors again, they might expect me to play rock again (since it worked twice) and counter with paper.\n\n6. Alternatively, they might think I'll anticipate their paper and play scissors, so they might play rock to counter.\n\n7. The game is likely in its final rounds or possibly the last round, and with my lead now at +6 points, I'm in a strong position.\n\n8. Given that they've played scissors three times in a row and lost twice to my rock, they're very likely to switch to a different move, with paper being the most logical choice to counter my expected rock.\n\n9. If they think I'll anticipate this and play scissors, they might play rock. However, given their recent losses, they're more likely to make a direct counter to my previous successful move.\n\n10. Considering all factors, I'll play scissors:\n    - If they play paper (countering my expected rock repeat), I'll win (+1 point)\n    - If they play rock (anticipating my scissors), I'll lose (-1 point)\n    - If they play scissors yet again, we'll tie\n\n11. This move is strategic because:\n    - It counters their likely paper play (if they're trying to beat my expected rock)\n    - If I lose, it's only by 1 point, which still leaves me with a substantial lead\n    - It continues to keep me unpredictable by varying my moves\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"
