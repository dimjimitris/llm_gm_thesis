Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any prior information about their tendencies.\n3. The payoff matrix shows that paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3), making paper potentially valuable.\n4.

If I choose paper and they choose scissors, I lose 1 point.\n7. If I choose paper and they choose paper, it's a tie (0 points).\n8.

And their full pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n5. After losing with rock against my paper twice, they might:\n   - Avoid rock since it has lost twice in a row\n   - Play scissors to counter my paper (which has been successful)\n   - Play paper to try something different, thinking I might play rock\n6. Given that I've won with paper twice in a row, they're very likely to expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors.\n7. If they play scissors expecting my paper, rock would be my best counter.\n8. If they play paper trying to beat my anticipated rock, scissors would win.\n9. If they play rock again (though unlikely after two losses with it), paper would win.\n10. The most probable scenario is that they'll play scissors to counter my recent successful paper plays, making rock my best response.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We've now had seven ties out of the last eight rounds, which is extraordinary.\n3. The sequence of our recent ties has been rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper.\n4. This creates a clear pattern: after paper-paper tie, the next tie in the sequence would be scissors-scissors.\n5. However, recognizing this pattern, both of us might try to break it.\n6. After tying with paper, the logical progression would be scissors to beat paper.\n7. But given our history, we both might choose scissors, resulting in another tie.\n8. To break this cycle, I could play rock to beat their anticipated scissors.\n9. But they might also be thinking the same way and choose rock themselves.\n10. Given the strong pattern of ties and the fact that scissors would be the natural counter to our mutual paper, rock would be my best response to beat their likely scissors play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We've now had eight ties out of the last nine rounds, which is truly remarkable.\n3. The pattern of ties has become: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock.\n4. This creates a sequence that doesn't strictly follow the natural progression of one move beating the previous one.\n5. After tying with rock, the logical counter would be paper to beat rock.\n6. However, given our extraordinary history of ties, there's a very high probability we'll both choose paper next.\n7. To break this cycle, I could try scissors to beat their anticipated paper.\n8. But they might also be thinking the same way and choose scissors themselves.\n9. Given the strong pattern of ties and the fact that we seem to be using very similar reasoning, I need to make a bold move to break the pattern.\n10. The most unexpected move would be to play rock again, as it contradicts the natural progression.\n11. However, the most logical move after a rock-rock tie would be paper, and I believe they'll play paper too.\n12. To break the tie pattern, I'll choose scissors to beat their likely paper play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We've now had ten consecutive ties, which is truly extraordinary and cannot be mere coincidence.\n3.

This suggests we're either using identical reasoning processes or my opponent is deliberately matching my moves.\n5. After tying with paper, the natural counter would be scissors to beat paper.\n6. Given our perfect record of ties in the last ten rounds, there's an extremely high probability we'll both choose scissors next.\n7. However, if my opponent is deliberately matching my moves, they must be waiting for me to submit my move first and then copying it.\n8. In that case, any move I make will result in a tie.\n9. If I want to break this cycle, I need to make a completely unexpected move that counters the natural progression.\n10. After paper-paper, scissors would be expected, so rock would counter that.\n11. However, given the pattern of identical moves, I'll likely tie again regardless of what I choose.\n12. Since rock has the potential for the highest gain (+1 against scissors) and the lowest loss (-3 against paper), I'll choose rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

At this point, it's virtually certain that my opponent is deliberately matching my moves, possibly by waiting to see what I choose and then making the same choice.\n5. If this is the case, no strategy will allow me to win - we will continue to tie regardless of what I choose.\n6.

After tying with rock, the natural counter would be paper to beat rock.\n8. Given our perfect record of ties, there's an extremely high probability we'll both choose paper next.\n9. To break this cycle, I could choose scissors to counter their anticipated paper.\n10. However, given the eleven consecutive ties, it seems almost certain they will match whatever I choose.\n11.

The streak of eleven consecutive ties has finally been broken.\n3. Interestingly, my opponent played rock when I played scissors, which suggests they're not simply matching my moves.\n4. This means they're either:\n   - Using a similar but slightly different reasoning process\n   - Deliberately broke the pattern of ties after establishing it\n   - Using a mixed strategy that occasionally deviates\n5. After losing with scissors against their rock, they might expect me to:\n   - Play paper to beat their rock (if they repeat it)\n   - Play rock to avoid losing to rock again\n   - Play scissors if I'm stubborn or think they'll switch to paper\n6. If they think I'll play paper to counter their rock, they might play scissors.\n7. If they think I'll play rock (to match their winning move), they might play paper.\n8. Given that they just broke a long streak of ties with rock, they might stick with rock since it was successful.\n9. Alternatively, they might anticipate I'll play paper and counter with scissors.\n10. The safest move would be rock, which would beat their scissors if they anticipate my paper, and tie against their rock if they repeat it.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We're back to having a tie after the brief interruption in the pattern.\n3. My opponent has now played rock twice in a row, which is a departure from their previous behavior.\n4. After tying with rock, the natural counter would be paper to beat rock.\n5. However, given our history of ties and their recent deviation from the pattern, they might:\n   - Play paper (anticipating I'll play rock again)\n   - Play scissors (anticipating I'll play paper to counter their rock)\n   - Play rock a third time (since it's been working well for them)\n6. If they play paper, scissors would win.\n7. If they play scissors, rock would win.\n8. If they play rock, paper would win.\n9. Given that they've played rock twice in a row and just won with it against my scissors, they might be developing confidence in rock as a strategy.\n10. However, they might also anticipate that I'll play paper to counter their repeated rock plays.\n11. Considering all factors, scissors seems like the best choice to counter their potential paper play, while accepting the risk they might play rock again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We've now had 15 ties out of the last 16 rounds, which is extraordinary.\n3. At this point, it seems almost certain that my opponent is either using identical reasoning or deliberately matching my moves.\n4. After tying with rock, the natural counter would be paper to beat rock.\n5. However, given our extensive history of ties, there's an extremely high probability we'll both choose paper next.\n6. The pattern seems nearly unbreakable at this point.\n7. Looking at the only round where the tie was broken (round 23), I played scissors and they played rock.\n8. This might suggest they have a slight preference for rock when they decide to break the pattern.\n9. If I want to try to break this cycle and they play paper (the natural counter to rock), scissors would be my best response.\n10. But given the overwhelming evidence of matching moves, I believe they'll play whatever I play.\n11. Since paper has the highest potential reward (+3 against rock) if they happen to play rock again, I'll choose paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The pattern of ties has been broken again - this time I lost with paper against their scissors.\n3. Looking at the two rounds where the ties were broken:\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 28: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n4. In both cases, they played the move that beats what I played, which suggests they might occasionally be able to predict my moves or are deliberately breaking the tie pattern to their advantage.\n5. After losing with paper against their scissors, they might expect me to:\n   - Play rock to beat their scissors (if they repeat it)\n   - Play scissors to avoid losing to scissors again\n   - Play paper if I'm stubborn or think they'll switch to rock\n6. If they think I'll play rock to counter their scissors, they might play paper.\n7. If they think I'll play scissors (to match their winning move), they might play rock.\n8. Given that they've now broken the tie pattern twice and won both times, they might be developing confidence in their ability to predict my moves.\n9. The safest move would be rock, which would beat their scissors if they repeat it, and tie against their rock if they anticipate my rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at the recent pattern:\n   - Round 28: They broke the tie pattern with scissors against my paper\n   - Round 29: They played scissors again and lost to my rock\n4. After losing with scissors against my rock, they might:\n   - Switch to paper to beat my potentially repeated rock\n   - Play rock to tie if I repeat rock or beat my potential scissors\n   - Play scissors again if they're stubborn or think I'll switch to paper\n5. Given that they've lost with scissors, they're most likely to switch to a different move.\n6. If they think I'll play rock again (since it just won), paper would be their logical choice.\n7. If they play paper expecting my rock, scissors would be my best response.\n8. However, they might also anticipate this and play rock to counter my potential scissors.\n9. Considering their overall pattern in the game, they seem to occasionally break patterns but also have long stretches of matching moves.\n10. Given that they just lost with scissors against my rock, and the natural counter to rock is paper, I believe they're most likely to play paper this round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
