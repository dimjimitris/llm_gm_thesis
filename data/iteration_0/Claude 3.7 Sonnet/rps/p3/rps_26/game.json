However, I notice that paper has the highest potential reward (+3) while scissors and rock only offer +1.

This strategy has allowed me to consistently predict and counter their moves with perfect accuracy, leading to a long winning streak for me.\n\nAfter losing with rock against my paper, based on their firmly established pattern, they're almost certainly going to:\n1. Switch to scissors (to counter my expected paper move)\n\nGiven their extremely consistent and predictable pattern of trying to counter my previous winning move, I am highly confident they'll play scissors, anticipating I'll play paper again after my win. I'll play rock to counter this expected scissors move.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
