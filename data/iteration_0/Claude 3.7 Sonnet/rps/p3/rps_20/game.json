Let's update my opponent's complete pattern of moves:\n   - Round 1: Rock\n   - Round 2: Paper\n   - Round 3: Rock\n   - Round 4: Paper\n   - Round 5: Paper\n   - Round 6: Rock\n   - Round 7: Scissors\n   - Round 8: Paper\n   - Round 9: Paper\n   - Round 10: Rock\n   - Round 11: Paper\n2. We've now tied with paper in the last round, making it the 5th tie overall.\n3. My opponent has played paper 6 times, rock 4 times, and scissors only once.\n4. Looking at their pattern after playing paper:\n   - After single paper plays, they've played rock (rounds 2\u21923, 8\u21929\u219210)\n   - After consecutive papers, they've played rock (rounds 4\u21925\u21926, 8\u21929\u219210)\n5. Given they just played paper, based on their historical pattern, they're likely to play paper again or switch to rock.\n6. If they play paper again, scissors would be my best move (1 point).\n7. If they switch to rock, paper would be my best move (3 points).\n8. I've noticed they've played rock after consecutive paper plays, but now they've just played paper after a rock, breaking their earlier pattern.\n9. They seem to be adapting their strategy, making it harder to predict.\n10. Given their strong preference for paper (6/11 rounds) and the fact that scissors has only been played once by them, I'll choose rock to counter a potential scissors play and to break the cycle of ties.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

I've had the most success with rock (never lost with it), while scissors has been my least successful move.\n8. Since they just played rock, based on their historical pattern, they might play paper next.\n9. If they play paper, scissors would be my best counter (1 point).\n10. However, scissors has been my least successful move, often countered by their rock.\n11. Given their tendency to play paper after rock historically, but also considering their increasing unpredictability, I'll take a calculated risk with scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I've now won two consecutive rounds! First with rock against scissors, then with scissors against paper.\n3. My prediction about them playing paper after scissors was correct.\n4. My overall record is now:\n   - 4 wins\n   - 6 ties\n   - 11 losses\n5. They've now played paper 9 times, rock 8 times, and scissors 4 times.\n6. Looking at what they play after paper:\n   - After paper, they've played rock 4 times and paper 3 times\n   - Recently (rounds 15\u219216, 18\u219219), they've played rock after paper\n7. After I've won with scissors:\n   - When I won with scissors in round 8, they played paper next\n   - I don't have enough data for when I win with scissors consecutively\n8. Given my recent success and their pattern of often playing rock after paper, they might:\n   - Play rock expecting me to play scissors again\n   - Play scissors thinking I might switch to paper\n   - Play paper to break their own pattern\n9. Since they've most frequently played rock after paper (4/7 times), and considering my recent success with scissors, they're likely anticipating I'll play scissors again.\n10. If they play rock to counter my expected scissors, paper would be my best move (3 points).\n11.
