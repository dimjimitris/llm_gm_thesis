Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Their alternating pattern continues: they've been consistently alternating between paper and scissors for the last 6 rounds.\n\n4. Following this clear pattern, their next move should be paper.\n\n5. My overall score is now -6 points. I've correctly predicted their last move, which gives me confidence in the pattern I've identified.\n\n6. If they follow their alternating pattern and play paper (which seems highly likely), my best move is scissors (+1).\n   If they break the pattern and play scissors again, scissors would be the worst choice (-1).\n   If they surprise with rock, paper would be best (+3).\n\n7. Given the strong consistency of their alternating pattern over many rounds, I believe they will play paper next.\n\n8. Therefore, I'll play scissors to counter their anticipated paper move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Their alternating pattern between paper and scissors has been broken by playing rock in the last round.\n\n4. Looking at their overall history, I notice they've played scissors 6 times, paper 3 times, and rock only 2 times.\n\n5. They may have noticed I was catching onto their alternating pattern and deliberately changed to rock to counter my scissors.\n\n6. My overall score is now -7 points.\n\n7. After playing rock, their possible next moves are:\n   - Return to their alternating pattern with paper or scissors\n   - Continue with rock again\n   - Switch to paper (which has worked well for them multiple times)\n\n8. Given that they've played rock so infrequently overall, I think they're unlikely to play it twice in a row.\n\n9. Since they've had success with paper against my rock previously, and paper would follow rock in a typical rotation, paper seems like a likely choice for them.\n\n10. If they play paper, my best move is scissors (+1).\n    If they play scissors (returning to their most common move), my best move is rock (+1).\n    If they play rock again, my best move is paper (+3).\n\n11. Considering their historical preferences and the fact that they just deviated from their pattern with rock, I think they're most likely to play either paper or return to scissors.\n\n12. I'll play scissors, betting that they'll choose paper this round.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I just won with rock against their scissors. My overall score is now -7 points.\n\n4. Their overall move distribution is: scissors (10 times), paper (6 times), and rock (2 times).\n\n5. After losing with scissors against rock, their historical pattern shows:\n   - They switched to paper (2 out of 2 times)\n\n6. This is a very consistent pattern - every time they lose with scissors against rock, they switch to paper in the next round.\n\n7. Additionally, I've noticed that when I win consecutive rounds, they tend to adapt more strategically to break my winning streak.\n\n8. If they follow their consistent pattern after losing with scissors against rock, they will play paper next.\n\n9. If they play paper (which seems most likely based on their history), my best move is scissors (+1).\n   If they play scissors again, my best move is rock (+1).\n   If they play rock, my best move is paper (+3).\n\n10. Given their highly consistent pattern of playing paper after losing with scissors against rock, I believe scissors is my best move this round.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I just lost with scissors against their rock. My overall score is now -8 points.\n\n4. Their overall move distribution is: scissors (10 times), paper (6 times), and rock (3 times).\n\n5. I notice they broke their previous pattern. Instead of playing paper after losing with scissors against rock, they played rock.\n\n6. After winning with rock against scissors, their historical pattern shows:\n   - They played paper (1 time)\n   - They played scissors (1 time)\n   - No clear pattern here\n\n7. Looking at their broader pattern, they've become less predictable in recent rounds, possibly adapting to counter my strategy.\n\n8. When they play rock, they've followed it with:\n   - Scissors (1 time)\n   - Paper (1 time)\n   - Rock (0 times)\n\n9. Since they just won with rock and have never played rock twice in a row in our game history, they're likely to switch to either paper or scissors.\n\n10. Given their overall preference for scissors throughout the game, and the fact that scissors would counter my potential paper (which would be a natural response to their rock), they might play scissors next.\n\n11. However, they might also play paper, anticipating that I'll play rock to counter their potential scissors move.\n\n12. If they play scissors (somewhat likely), my best move is rock (+1).\n    If they play paper (also possible), my best move is scissors (+1).\n    If they play rock again (least likely), my best move is paper (+3).\n\n13.

Looking at their most recent moves, they went from rock \u2192 scissors, showing they continue to be somewhat unpredictable.\n\n7. Their strong preference for scissors (over 50% of their moves) suggests they might play it again.\n\n8. However, after multiple scissors plays, they often switch to either rock or paper.\n\n9. Since they've just played scissors and we tied, they might anticipate that I'll play rock to counter potential scissors, which would lead them to play paper.\n\n10. If they play paper (which seems strategically sound), my best move is scissors (+1).\n    If they play scissors again, my best move is rock (+1).\n    If they play rock, my best move is paper (+3).\n\n11.

We just tied with rock. My overall score remains at -6 points.\n\n4. Their overall move distribution is: scissors (13 times), paper (7 times), and rock (4 times).\n\n5. After a tie with rock, their historical pattern shows:\n   - They played scissors (1 time)\n   - No clear pattern with just one instance\n\n6. Looking at their broader pattern, after playing rock, they've followed with:\n   - Scissors (2 times)\n   - Paper (0 times)\n   - Rock (0 times)\n\n7. They've never played rock twice in a row in our entire game history.\n\n8. Given the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle, and their tendency to follow rock with scissors, they might play scissors next.\n\n9. However, they might also anticipate that I'll expect scissors and play rock to counter it, which would make paper a good choice for them.\n\n10. If they play scissors (somewhat likely based on history), my best move is rock (+1).\n    If they play paper (possible as a strategic counter), my best move is scissors (+1).\n    If they play rock again (least likely based on history), my best move is paper (+3).\n\n11. Considering they've never played rock twice in a row, and their tendency to follow rock with scissors, I think scissors is a less likely move for them this round. It's more likely they'll play either paper (to beat my potential rock) or scissors (following their historical pattern after rock).\n\n12. Given that they have a stronger overall preference for scissors than paper, and they've historically followed rock with scissors, I'll play rock to counter their anticipated scissors move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

They've played scissors again after a scissors tie more often than any other move.\n\n7. Looking at their recent behavior, they've now played scissors in 5 of the last 5 rounds, showing an extremely strong recent preference for scissors.\n\n8. This 5-round scissors streak is unprecedented in our game and suggests they might be settling into a pattern or trying to establish one.\n\n9. After such a long streak of the same move, there's a psychological tendency to eventually switch. However, they might also be testing if I'll continue to counter with rock or eventually switch my strategy.\n\n10. If they play scissors again (continuing their streak), my best move is rock (+1).\n    If they finally switch to paper (anticipating my rock), my best move is scissors (+1).\n    If they switch to rock, my best move is paper (+3).\n\n11. Given their extraordinary 5-round scissors streak, I think there's a higher than usual chance they'll finally switch to paper, anticipating I'll play rock again (as I've done successfully multiple times).\n\n12.

Looking at their overall strategy, they seem to be adapting effectively to my moves, correctly anticipating my rock and countering it with paper.\n\n9. Given that they just had success with paper (+3 points), they might:\n   - Switch to scissors (their most common move and their most common follow-up after winning with paper)\n   - Play paper again (since it just worked well)\n   - Switch to rock (their least common move)\n\n10. If they play scissors (which seems most likely based on history), my best move is rock (+1).\n    If they play paper again, my best move is scissors (+1).\n    If they play rock, my best move is paper (+3).\n\n11. Considering their historical tendency to play scissors after winning with paper against rock, and their overall preference for scissors throughout the game, I believe they're most likely to play scissors this round.\n\n12. Therefore, I'll play rock to counter their anticipated scissors move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"
