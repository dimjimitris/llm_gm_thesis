I'm playing against a fresh player, which means there's no prior history to analyze.\n2. The payoff matrix shows that paper beating rock gives the highest reward (3 points), while the other winning moves only give 1 point.\n3. Without knowing the other player's tendencies, I should consider what most players typically choose in the first round.\n4. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"safe.\"\n5. If I play paper and they play rock, I get 3 points. If they play scissors, I lose 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n6. The expected value of playing paper seems highest given the common first-move tendencies and the payoff structure.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the common first-move tendency toward rock, and to potentially earn the highest payoff.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In the previous round, I played paper and my opponent played rock, so I won 3 points.\n2. Now I need to consider how my opponent might adjust their strategy after losing.\n3. Players who lose with rock often switch to scissors in the next round, thinking their opponent might play paper again.\n4. If my opponent follows this pattern, they'll likely play scissors this time.\n5. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n6. However, they might also anticipate that I'll expect them to switch and deliberately stick with rock.\n7. Let me evaluate the risk-reward: If I play rock and they play scissors, I win 1 point. If they play paper, I lose 3 points.\n8. Since paper gives the highest reward when it wins, my opponent might be tempted to play it.\n9. Given the uncertainty and the higher potential loss from playing rock against paper, I think playing scissors is the safer option.\n10. If they play paper, I win 1 point. If they play rock, I lose 1 point.

Let me consider their perspective: They've lost twice in a row and might try something different to break their losing streak.\n9. They might anticipate that I'll expect scissors and play rock to counter it, in which case they might play paper.\n10. But this is getting into multiple levels of mind games.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
