This suggests they're becoming more responsive to my moves and patterns. Given that they just played scissors and had success with it, there's a reasonable chance they might stay with scissors for another round. By playing rock, I can counter this potential repeated scissors play. This adjustment responds directly to their most recent move while trying to anticipate their adaptation to our evolving game dynamics.\n"
