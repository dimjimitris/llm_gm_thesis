Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without knowing the opponent's tendencies, there's no statistical advantage to any particular move.\n4. In first-time encounters, some research suggests that rock is slightly more common as a first move among human players.\n5. If the opponent is indeed more likely to choose rock, then paper would be the optimal counter.\n6. However, if the opponent anticipates this reasoning, they might choose scissors instead.\n7.

Looking at their behavior after wins:\n    - After winning with rock in round 3, they switched to scissors\n    - After winning with paper in round 7, they switched to rock\n    - Now, after winning with scissors, they may follow a similar pattern of switching\n17. They don't seem to have a consistent pattern after wins, but they do tend to change moves rather than repeat.\n18. If they follow this tendency to switch after a win, they're more likely to choose either rock or paper.\n19. Between these two options, rock has been their more successful and frequent choice historically.\n20. Additionally, if they think I'll choose rock to counter their recent scissors, they might choose paper.\n\nFinal decision: Given these considerations, I'll choose scissors for this round, anticipating they might switch to paper (either to counter my expected rock or as part of their tendency to switch after wins).\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Round 17: My rock vs. their scissors (I won, +1 points)\n18. Round 18: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n19. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n20. My opponent has now used rock six times, paper six times, and scissors six times - a perfectly balanced distribution.\n21. They've used scissors twice in a row now, which is the first time they've repeated a move consecutively since rounds 9-10.\n22. After a tie with scissors, their historical behavior:\n    - After the tie in round 9, they used scissors again\n    - No consistent pattern from just one data point\n23. Looking at their broader recent pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n24. My winning streak was broken by the tie, but I haven't lost in the last four rounds.\n25. After consecutive moves of the same type, players often switch to a different move.\n26. If they follow this tendency, they're likely to move away from scissors after using it twice.\n27. Between rock and paper, rock would be the logical choice if they anticipate I'll use scissors again.\n28. Alternatively, they might anticipate I'll choose rock (to counter their potential scissors) and they might use paper.\n29. Given their perfectly balanced distribution of moves and their recent double use of scissors, they're more likely to switch to either rock or paper.\n30. Rock seems slightly more probable given it would counter scissors if they think I might repeat it.\n\nFinal decision: Based on these considerations, I'll choose paper for this round, anticipating they might switch to rock after using scissors twice consecutively.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent has now used rock seven times, paper six times, and scissors six times.\n22. I successfully predicted their rock move and won with paper.\n23. I'm now on a strong four-round unbeaten streak (3 wins, 1 tie), which puts significant psychological pressure on my opponent.\n24. After losing with rock, their historical behavior:\n    - Switched to rock after losing to my paper in round 1 (though that was a tie)\n    - Switched to scissors after losing to my paper in round 6\n    - Switched to paper after losing to my paper in round 14\n    - Switched to scissors after losing to my paper in round 16\n    - No consistent pattern, but they tend to switch moves after losses\n25. Looking at their recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n26. They've used rock twice after previously using scissors twice, showing a tendency to break patterns of repeated moves.\n27. After I win, especially multiple times in a row, my opponent is likely to try something different to break my streak.\n28. After my paper beat their rock, they might anticipate me using paper again and counter with scissors.\n29. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors (expecting them to use paper) and they might choose rock.\n30. Given my recent success with paper (winning three times with it in the last six rounds), they're likely to anticipate me using paper again.\n31. Between scissors (to counter my potential paper) and paper (to counter my potential rock), scissors seems more likely given my recent success with paper.\n\nFinal decision: Based on these considerations and anticipating they'll try to counter my winning paper move with scissors, I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at their recent pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n26. There's no clear recent pattern in their moves, but they have been effective at countering my moves.\n27. They've now beaten me with paper five times, more than any other move.\n28. After they win, they often switch moves rather than repeating the winning move.\n29. Between rock and scissors, scissors has been less used overall and would counter a potential paper move from me.\n30.

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n26. My opponent has now used rock nine times, paper eight times, and scissors seven times.\n27. I correctly predicted their rock move in the last round and won with paper.\n28. After losing with rock, their historical behavior:\n    - Switched to rock after losing to my paper in round 1 (though that was a tie)\n    - Switched to scissors after losing to my paper in round 6\n    - Switched to paper after losing to my paper in round 14\n    - Switched to scissors after losing to my paper in round 16\n    - Switched to paper after losing to my paper in round 19\n    - No consistent pattern, but they tend to switch moves after losses\n29. Looking at their recent pattern: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n30. Their last four moves show a cycle: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n31. If this pattern continues, they might choose scissors next.\n32. After I win, my opponent might anticipate me repeating my winning move (paper) and counter with scissors.\n33. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors (expecting them to use paper) and they might choose rock.\n34. Given their recent cyclic pattern and their tendency to switch after losses, scissors seems like a reasonable prediction for their next move.\n35. If they use scissors, my optimal counter would be rock.\n36. However, if they anticipate this reasoning and break their pattern, they might choose paper or rock instead.\n37. Considering their historical patterns after losing with rock and the recent cyclic pattern, scissors seems most likely for their next move.\n\nFinal decision: Based on these considerations, I'll choose rock for this round, anticipating they might switch to scissors after losing with rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has now used rock ten times, paper eight times, and scissors seven times.\n28. They've used rock twice in a row now, which is relatively unusual in their pattern.\n29. After a tie with rock, their historical behavior:\n    - Switched to rock after tying with rock in round 2\n    - Switched to scissors after tying with rock in round 21\n    - No consistent pattern\n30. Looking at their recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n31. After consecutive uses of rock, players often switch to a different move.\n32. If they follow this tendency, they're likely to move away from rock after using it twice.\n33. Between paper and scissors, paper has been more successful against me historically.\n34. After ties, players often switch to a different move to try to gain an advantage.\n35. Given their historical distribution of moves (rock being most common) and the fact they've just used rock twice in a row, they're likely to switch.\n36. Paper would be the logical choice if they anticipate I'll use rock again after the tie.\n37. However, if they think I'll anticipate this and use scissors, they might choose rock again or switch to scissors.\n38. Considering their tendency to switch after repeated moves and after ties, paper seems like a reasonable prediction for their next move.\n\nFinal decision: Based on these considerations, I'll choose scissors for this round, anticipating they might switch to paper after consecutive rock moves and a tie.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After a tie with scissors, their historical behavior:\n    - After the tie in round 9, they used scissors again\n    - After the tie in round 18, they used rock\n    - After the tie in round 22, they used paper\n    - No consistent pattern\n31. Looking at their recent pattern: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n32. We're now in an unusual situation with three consecutive ties.\n33.

After consecutive ties, there's psychological pressure to make a definitive move to break the pattern.\n36. Given the recent scissors tie and their overall preference for rock, they might return to rock to try to break the tie streak.\n37.

After a tie with paper, their historical behavior:\n    - After the tie in round 1, they used rock\n    - No other paper ties until now\n32. Looking at their recent pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n33. We're in an extraordinary situation with four consecutive ties across all three possible moves.\n34. The psychological pressure to break this tie streak is now extremely high.\n35. Given that we've now tied with all three possible moves in succession, there's no clear pattern to predict their next move.\n36. In this situation, they might revert to their most comfortable or preferred move, which appears to be rock based on frequency.\n37. Alternatively, they might try to analyze what I'm likely to do to break the tie streak and counter that.\n38. After cycling through all three moves in ties, they might return to rock, thinking I'll try scissors to counter their potential paper.\n39.
