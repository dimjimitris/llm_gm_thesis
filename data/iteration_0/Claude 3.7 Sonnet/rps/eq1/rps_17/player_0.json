Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing against a fresh player, meaning there's no prior history to analyze for patterns.\n2. In the absence of information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider basic RPS strategy.\n3. Research suggests that in the first round of RPS between strangers, rock is the most common choice (approximately 35-36% of players choose it first).\n4. Paper would be the optimal counter to this statistical tendency.\n5. However, my opponent might be anticipating this reasoning and choose scissors instead.\n6. Since I have no specific information about this opponent, I should make my first move relatively unpredictable.\n7. Given these considerations, I'll choose rock for my first move as it has a slight defensive advantage against scissors (which would be chosen by a sophisticated opponent anticipating my paper play).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this first round and observe the opponent's behavior to adjust my strategy for subsequent rounds.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I've now won eight consecutive rounds, which is remarkable. My opponent has not won a single round.\n\n3. Looking at the opponent's recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   They've completed their reverse cycle (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock) and started it again.\n\n4.

After losing eight times in a row, the opponent is likely:\n   a) Completely demoralized\n   b) May have given up on strategy altogether\n   c) Might resort to truly random choices out of desperation\n   d) Could be continuing their pattern without conscious awareness\n\n6. If they continue their recent reverse cycle pattern, they would play rock next.\n\n7. However, they might also:\n   a) Try to break out of any pattern they suspect I've detected\n   b) Choose a move that would have beaten my last move (rock would beat my scissors)\n   c) Make a completely random choice out of frustration\n\n8. Given their consistent pattern adherence despite losses, and the psychological tendency to try to counter the move that just beat you, rock is the most probable choice.\n\n9. To counter their probable rock play, I should play paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this eleventh round to counter the anticipated rock move from my opponent.\n\n[move] paper\n"
