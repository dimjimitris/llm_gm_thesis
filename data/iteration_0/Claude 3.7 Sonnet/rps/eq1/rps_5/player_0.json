    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) have equal expected value.\n4. Studies show that rock is slightly more common as a first move among human players, so paper might have a slight advantage.\n5. However, without knowing if my opponent is aware of such tendencies, this is speculative.\n6. Given the complete uncertainty, I should make my choice unpredictable.\n7. I'll choose paper for this first round, as it beats the statistically common first choice of rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this first round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After a tie with scissors, common strategies include:\n   - Playing rock, which would beat a repeated scissors\n   - Playing scissors again, expecting the opponent to play paper\n   - Playing paper, expecting the opponent to play rock to counter scissors\n\n5. Given the history of our game and their tendency to play scissors frequently, they might:\n   - Play rock, anticipating I'll play scissors again or paper\n   - Play scissors again, thinking I wouldn't expect a third scissors tie\n   - Play paper if they think I'll definitely switch to rock\n\n6. My opponent has shown they can adapt well to counter my moves, but they also have a tendency to return to scissors.\n\n7. Since we've tied with scissors twice, and they've played scissors 5 times total, I think there's a higher probability they'll switch to rock this time.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their expected rock move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They've returned to rock after their scissors play lost\n   - This suggests they accurately predicted my scissors move\n\n3. My performance update:\n   - My win was followed by a loss\n   - My overall record is 6 wins, 8 losses, and 5 ties\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has played rock in 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - They seem to be shifting toward a rock-dominant strategy\n   - They've successfully adapted to counter my recent moves\n\n5. Psychological factors:\n   - After winning with rock against my scissors, they might stick with rock\n   - They might expect me to play paper to counter their rock\n   - If they expect paper from me, they would play scissors\n\n6. My strategy considerations:\n   - If they play rock again (continuing their recent preference), I should play paper\n   - If they play scissors (countering my expected paper), I should play rock\n   - If they play paper (expecting me to play rock), I should play scissors\n\n7. Given their recent success with rock and the overall game dynamics:\n   - They might continue with rock since it just worked\n   - They might anticipate I'll play paper to counter their rock and thus play scissors\n   - Their recent pattern suggests increased rock usage\n\n8. After their successful rock play against my scissors, I need to consider both their potential to repeat a winning move and their ability to anticipate my counter.\n\n9. Based on their recent pattern shift toward more rock plays and the psychological tendency to repeat winning moves, I believe they're more likely to play rock again or switch to scissors in anticipation of my paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their potential rock repeat, while accepting the risk that they might have anticipated this and played scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My performance update:\n   - I've lost 2 rounds in a row\n   - My overall record is 6 wins, 9 losses, and 5 ties\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has played scissors 10 times (50% of all rounds)\n   - They've won with scissors against my paper 4 times\n   - They seem to have returned to favoring scissors\n\n5. Scissors analysis:\n   - When I've played against their scissors: I've lost 4 times with paper, tied 3 times with scissors, won 0 times with rock\n   - This means they've played scissors when I played rock 0 times out of 10 scissors plays\n   - This is a significant pattern - they avoid playing scissors when I play rock\n\n6. Psychological factors:\n   - After winning with scissors against my paper, they might continue with scissors\n   - However, their pattern suggests they never play scissors when I play rock\n   - They might expect me to play rock to counter their scissors and thus play paper\n\n7. My strategy considerations:\n   - If they play scissors again (continuing their winning move), I should play rock\n   - If they play paper (expecting my rock), I should play scissors\n   - If they play rock (returning to alternation), I should play paper\n\n8. Given their strong scissors preference but complete avoidance of playing scissors against my rock:\n   - Playing rock gives me the best chance of either winning against scissors or tying against rock\n   - The data strongly suggests they won't play scissors if they expect me to play rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock as it has the highest expected value against their likely moves, based on their demonstrated pattern of never playing scissors against my rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Psychological factors:\n   - After a tie, players often change their move\n   - They've shown a tendency to play scissors after rock-rock ties previously\n   - They might expect me to play paper to beat their rock\n\n6. Historical pattern after rock-rock ties:\n   - We've had rock-rock ties twice before (rounds 16-17)\n   - After those ties, they played scissors in round 18\n   - This historical pattern might repeat\n\n7.

Psychological factors:\n   - After four consecutive identical moves, the pressure to change is overwhelming\n   - They might be testing my patience or trying to condition my response\n   - They might expect me to finally switch to paper after so many rock ties\n\n6. Game theory considerations:\n   - The optimal counter to their apparent strategy is to play paper\n   - However, they might be deliberately setting a trap, expecting me to finally play paper\n   - If they're setting a trap, they would switch to scissors at exactly the point they expect me to switch to paper\n\n7. My strategy considerations:\n   - If they play scissors (finally breaking their rock streak), I should play rock\n   - If they play paper (countering my expected rock), I should play scissors\n   - If they play rock a fifth time (defying all conventional wisdom), I should play paper\n\n8. Weighing the evidence:\n   - Four consecutive rock plays is so unusual that it must be deliberate\n   - They might be attempting to create a pattern just to break it at a critical moment\n   - The psychological tension to switch is now extreme for both players\n\n9. Final analysis:\n   - Their most likely move is scissors, anticipating I'll finally switch to paper\n   - A fifth consecutive rock would be almost unheard of in rock-paper-scissors strategy\n   - This is clearly a psychological game at this point\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to paper, accepting the risk that they might have been setting up this exact moment to play scissors. After four consecutive rock plays, the expected value of playing paper is higher than continuing with rock, even considering the possibility of a trap.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They broke their rock streak with scissors exactly when I switched to paper\n   - This confirms they were setting up a deliberate trap\n\n3. My performance update:\n   - Current record: 7 wins, 11 losses, 8 ties\n   - They've beaten my paper with scissors 5 times now\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - They successfully predicted my switch to paper after a long rock streak\n   - They've shown remarkable patience in executing this strategy\n   - Their pattern of play is highly strategic rather than random\n\n5. Psychological factors:\n   - After successfully springing their trap, they might return to a more conventional strategy\n   - They might expect me to play rock next to counter their scissors\n   - If they expect rock from me, they might play paper\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - They've demonstrated advanced psychological gameplay\n   - They're clearly tracking patterns and making deliberate moves\n   - They might continue with psychological manipulation\n\n7. My strategy considerations:\n   - If they play scissors again (expecting me to play paper), I should play rock\n   - If they play paper (countering my expected rock), I should play scissors\n   - If they play rock (returning to their previous streak), I should play paper\n\n8. Weighing the evidence:\n   - After successfully executing their trap, they're unlikely to play scissors again immediately\n   - They've shown they can anticipate my moves and plan several steps ahead\n   - Their most logical move would be paper, anticipating my rock response to their scissors\n\n9. Final analysis:\n   - They're likely expecting me to play rock to counter their scissors\n   - Given their demonstrated strategic thinking, paper is their most probable next move\n   - However, they might also try to double-bluff by playing scissors again\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper move. This acknowledges their likely anticipation of my rock response to their scissors and attempts to stay one step ahead in this psychological battle.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
