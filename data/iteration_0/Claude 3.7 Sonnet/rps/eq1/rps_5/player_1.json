    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The last round resulted in a tie with both of us choosing scissors.\n\n4. Looking at their overall pattern, after scissors they have consistently played paper (in rounds 5\u21926 and 8\u21929).\n\n5. However, they might be aware that I've been catching onto their pattern and may deliberately break it.\n\n6. After a tie, players often change their move. Since we both played scissors, they might switch to rock (which beats scissors).\n\n7. Considering their established pattern (scissors \u2192 paper) and the psychology of changing after a tie, they face conflicting impulses.\n\n8. Given that their pattern has been so consistent throughout the game, I think they're more likely to follow it and choose paper.\n\n9. But I also need to consider that they might be adapting to my strategy. If they think I'll expect paper and play scissors, they might play rock.\n\n10. Weighing these factors, I believe their established pattern is the stronger predictor - after scissors has come paper twice in their history.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to counter their likely paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has been playing fairly predictable counter-moves:\n   - After losing with rock, they switched to scissors\n   - After losing with scissors, they switched to paper\n   - After losing with paper, they switched to rock\n\n4. This suggests they're using a basic strategy of \"play what would have beaten the opponent's last move.\"\n\n5.
