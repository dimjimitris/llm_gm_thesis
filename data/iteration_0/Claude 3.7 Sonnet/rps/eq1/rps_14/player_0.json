Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

They've now successfully countered me multiple rounds in a row, suggesting they're accurately predicting my moves.\n5. Looking at recent patterns:\n   - I played rock, they played paper (they won)\n   - I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\n   - I played paper, they played scissors (they won)\n6. This suggests they might be using a strategy where they play what would beat what they expect me to play.\n7.

If they think I'll play scissors next (to beat their expected paper), they might play rock.\n10. Given that they've only played scissors twice and just used it successfully, they're unlikely to repeat it immediately.\n11. They've shown a preference for rock and paper throughout the game.\n12. Since they just used scissors successfully, they might return to either rock or paper.\n13. Based on their overall pattern, rock seems slightly more likely.\n14.

Looking at their pattern after losses:\n   - When they lose with rock, they've sometimes switched to paper, but also sometimes stayed with rock\n   - When they lose with paper, they've switched to scissors and to rock\n8. Given they just lost with rock against my paper, scissors would be their logical counter if they expect me to repeat paper.\n9. However, they might also anticipate that I'll expect this and play scissors myself, in which case they might play rock.\n10.
