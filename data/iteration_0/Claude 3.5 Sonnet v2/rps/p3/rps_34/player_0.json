    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beating rock gives highest reward (3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors gives 1 point\n   - Scissors beating paper gives 1 point\n   - Losses give corresponding negative points\n\n3. Since paper has potential for highest reward (3 points):\n   - If opponent plays rock, I win big\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose small (-1 point)\n\n4. This risk/reward ratio seems favorable for paper:\n   - Best case: +3 points\n   - Middle case: 0 points\n   - Worst case: -1 point\n\n5.

Pattern breaking point:\n   - We're in a tie sequence again\n   - Players typically try to break tie sequences\n   - They matched my shift to paper\n   - They've shown ability to adapt to patterns\n\n3. Multi-level thinking:\n   - After two ties, they might think:\n     * I'll stick with paper (then they'd play scissors)\n     * I'll expect scissors and play rock (then they'd play paper)\n     * I'll anticipate paper and play scissors (then they'd play rock)\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - Most players try to break tie sequences\n   - Scissors is common aggressive choice after ties\n   - They might expect me to stick with paper\n   - Rock beats scissors but loses to paper\n\n5. Decision:\n   - I'll play rock\n   - Reasons:\n     * Protects against likely scissors play to break tie\n     * They've shown tendency to get aggressive after ties\n     * Two consecutive ties increases likelihood of pattern break\n     * Rock beats scissors (+1) if they go aggressive\n     * Even if they play paper (-3), breaking tie pattern is necessary\n     * Similar situation earlier in game led to scissors play by them\n\n[move] rock\n"
