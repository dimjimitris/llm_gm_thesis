    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock gives highest reward (3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give lower rewards (1 point)\n   - Losses result in corresponding negative points\n\n3. Without any information about the opponent:\n   - Playing paper has potential for highest gain (3 points)\n   - But also risk of highest loss (-3 points if opponent plays scissors)\n   - Rock and scissors have more balanced risk/reward (\u00b11 point)\n\n4. For a first move, it's reasonable to:\n   - Avoid the highest risk option (paper)\n   - Choose a balanced option\n   - Rock is often a common first choice for many players\n\n5. Decision: I'll choose rock as it offers balanced risk/reward and is a solid opening move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern consideration:\n   - Our winning sequence: scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\n   - We've used all three moves successfully\n   - They might expect us to start the cycle again\n   - Or expect us to continue rotating forward\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Play paper because:\n     * They might expect us to play scissors (starting cycle again)\n     * They might play rock as a safe move after losses\n     * Paper gives highest potential points (+3)\n     * Maintains our unpredictable sequence\n     * They haven't seen us use this pattern before\n     * Worth the risk while we have momentum\n\n[move] paper\n"
