    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For studying potential patterns and psychological aspects\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward ratios of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff structure. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also highest potential loss (-3). Rock and scissors have lower risk-reward profiles (\u00b11 point). Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any pattern to work with.\n\nPattern Analyst: Without prior moves to analyze, we should consider the psychology of first moves. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that paper beats rock with the highest payoff (3 points), and only loses to scissors with a minimal loss (-1 point), paper offers an asymmetric risk-reward opportunity. Even if we're wrong, we minimize our potential loss.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The expected value of playing paper is higher if we assume a higher probability of rock being played by a new player.\n\nPattern Analyst: Playing paper also gives us an opportunity to observe the opponent's first move without risking the maximum penalty.\n\nRisk Manager: The consensus seems to be forming around paper as the optimal first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper I choose paper based on its favorable risk-reward ratio and the psychological tendency of players to choose rock as their first move.\n"

They follow similar strategic thinking to us\n2. They might anticipate us sticking to paper and adjust accordingly\n\nGame Strategist: Given that both players chose paper, we need to consider how a rational opponent might adjust their strategy. They might:\n1. Expect us to stay with paper and counter with scissors\n2. Switch to rock thinking we'll switch to scissors\n3. Stay with paper expecting a complex mind game\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at the payoff structure again:\n- If they play scissors (to beat our paper), rock would be our best counter\n- If they play rock (thinking we'll switch to scissors), paper would win\n- If they stay with paper, any change we make risks being countered\n\nPattern Analyst: In this type of situation, where both players showed similar strategic thinking in round 1, there's often a tendency to try to \"outsmart\" the opponent by making a change. This suggests they might switch to scissors to counter paper.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, rock would be our safest play. It:\n- Beats scissors (their most likely move) for +1 point\n- Loses to paper (if they stick) for -3 points\n- Ties with rock (if they try to be extra clever) for 0 points\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing rock. While it has the potential for the biggest loss against paper, it protects against the most psychologically likely move (scissors) and maintains a balanced position in the game.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the previous tie with paper and the likelihood of the opponent switching to scissors, I choose rock as a defensive counter-move.\n"

The opponent is thinking strategically\n2. They attempted to counter our previous paper play\n3. They showed willingness to change tactics\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the sequence so far:\nRound 1: Paper (us) vs Paper (them) - Tie\nRound 2: Rock (us) vs Scissors (them) - We won\nThe opponent has shown a pattern of trying to counter the previous round's move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this pattern, we need to consider:\n1. If they think we'll stay with rock (our winning move), they might play paper\n2. If they think we'll anticipate paper and play scissors, they might play rock\n3. If they think we're analyzing this deeply, they might try to break the pattern entirely\n\nPattern Analyst: Psychology suggests that after losing, players often:\n1. Either switch to what beat them (paper in this case)\n2. Or try to break perceived patterns completely\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we've shown strong predictive ability, they're likely to respect our strategy and try to counter what they think we'll do. The safest assumption is that they'll play paper to beat our rock.\n\nRisk Manager: I suggest we play scissors. Here's why:\n- If they play paper (to beat our previous rock), we win +1 point\n- If they play rock (to break pattern), we lose only -1 point\n- If they play scissors (unlikely given previous moves), we tie\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed.

Their sequence doesn't show a clear pattern, which suggests they're either:\n1. Using a randomized strategy\n2. Making carefully considered counter-moves\n3.

Here's why:\n- If they play scissors (countering our expected paper), we win +1\n- If they play rock, we tie and regroup\n- If they play paper, we lose -3, but this seems less likely as:\n  * They just used rock successfully\n  * Starting with paper would be risky\n  * They might expect us to play scissors after our loss\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed.

Both players are locked in a perfect mirror\n4. Breaking the pattern might feel like breaking a spell\n\nGame Strategist: Strategic considerations:\n1. The natural progression would be scissors\n2. Breaking pattern now would be extremely bold\n3. Both players know they must break eventually\n4. But neither wants to be the one to break it\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend staying with the pattern - scissors. Here's why:\n- The psychological cost of breaking six ties is enormous\n- Both players are likely too invested in the pattern\n- Breaking it now might be exactly what they expect\n- Sometimes the obvious play is the right play\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Six consecutive ties creates such powerful psychological momentum that breaking the pattern becomes almost unthinkable. The pattern itself has become the dominant strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After an unprecedented six consecutive ties, we maintain the established pattern with scissors. The psychological weight of such a long string of ties makes maintaining the pattern the most stable strategy, even though both players know it must break eventually.\n"

Three ties in last four moves\n2. Both scissors ties bookend a rock tie\n3. Only non-tie was our scissors win against paper\n4. Pattern becoming highly symmetric\n\nRisk Manager: Current situation:\n1. +5 lead remains stable\n2. High frequency of ties suggests strong mutual prediction\n3. Both players showing similar strategic thinking\n4. Game becoming increasingly psychological\n\nPattern Analyst: Psychological analysis:\n1. Multiple ties create pressure to break pattern\n2. Both players know rock is natural progression\n3. But both also know it's obvious\n4. Creates complex mind game\n\nGame Strategist: Their likely thinking:\n1. They might follow progression to rock\n2. Could expect us to skip to paper\n3. Might try to surprise with paper themselves\n4. Rock seems most logical but most obvious\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend paper. Here's why:\n- If they play rock (natural progression), we win +3\n- After multiple ties, they might play conservatively\n- Even if they play scissors, we only lose -1\n- Need to break tie sequence with potential high reward\n\nPattern Analyst: Disagree. After scissors tie and many recent ties, they're more likely to try breaking pattern with paper themselves. I recommend scissors again.\n\nGame Strategist: The Risk Manager's analysis is more compelling here. After so many ties, playing paper gives us the best risk-reward ratio. If they play the obvious rock, we win big; if they play scissors, our loss is minimal.\n\nPattern Analyst: You've convinced me. The psychological pressure of multiple ties might push them toward a conservative rock play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper After multiple ties including consecutive scissors ties, we expect them to either follow the natural progression to rock or play conservatively. Paper gives us maximum reward potential against rock while maintaining acceptable risk against other moves.\n"
