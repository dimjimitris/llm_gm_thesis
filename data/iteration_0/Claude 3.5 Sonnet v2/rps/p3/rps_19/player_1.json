    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior and identifying trends\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Rock vs Paper: -3 points (worst outcome)\n- Rock vs Scissors: +1 point (moderate gain)\n- Rock vs Rock: 0 points (neutral)\nSimilar patterns exist for other moves. Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) but moderate risk (-1).\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move, we can't analyze any patterns yet. However, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move as it feels \"strong\" psychologically.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that Paper has the highest potential payoff (+3) and only a moderate downside (-1), it presents the best risk-reward ratio. If opponent plays Rock (a common first move), we get maximum points. If they play Scissors, our loss is minimal.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper gives us the best expected value considering typical first-move behaviors and the payoff structure.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Starting with paper as it offers the best risk-reward ratio, with potential for maximum gain (+3) against a likely rock play, while limiting potential loss (-1).\n"

They might try to counter what they think we'll play next\n\nGame Strategist: Given they played paper last time and it resulted in a tie, they might:\n- Stick with paper hoping we change (some players are creatures of habit)\n- Switch to scissors expecting us to play paper again\n- Switch to rock trying to be unpredictable\n\nRisk Manager: If they expect us to play paper again, they'll likely switch to scissors. However, if we play rock:\n- We win against scissors (+1)\n- We lose against paper (-3)\n- We tie against rock (0)\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper first. Against a strategic player, we should avoid being too predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the payoff structure and the opponent's demonstrated strategic capacity, I recommend playing rock. Here's why:\n- It beats scissors (which they might play expecting our paper)\n- If they stick to paper, our loss is capped at -3\n- It introduces unpredictability into our strategy\n\nRisk Manager: I concur. While rock has a bigger potential loss, it protects against the most likely counter to our previous move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Switching to rock to counter a potential scissors play, while maintaining strategic unpredictability.\n"

Using similar strategic reasoning as us\n3. Pure coincidence (less likely after two matches)\n\nGame Strategist: If they are indeed mirroring our moves, they're either:\n- Analyzing our moves and coincidentally making the same choices\n- Actually following our moves with some delay\n- Using very similar strategic reasoning\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at our options:\n1.

If they're using similar strategic reasoning, they might expect us to play paper to beat their expected rock. Scissors would counter that while having minimal downside.\n\nRisk Manager: The risk-reward for scissors is optimal here: potential +1 gain with only -1 risk, and it breaks the pattern effectively.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Breaking the tie pattern with scissors, which offers balanced risk-reward and counters the potential paper play while having minimal downside against other moves.\n"
