Pattern analysis:\n   - My last moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - Opponent's last moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - We both played paper last round\n   - Similar to start of game when we both played paper\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - After a tie, players often want to break deadlock\n   - Opponent might think I'm falling into predictable patterns\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll do\n   - The tie might make them more aggressive\n\n4. Common post-tie behaviors:\n   - Many players switch to scissors after paper tie\n   - Some stick with paper expecting others to switch\n   - Few switch to rock as it's less intuitive after paper\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If they switch to scissors (likely): rock wins (+1)\n   - If they stay with paper (possible): rock loses (-3)\n   - If they switch to rock (less likely): rock ties (0)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Need to protect against scissors play\n   - Can't be too predictable with paper again\n   - Rock offers good balance of offense and defense\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock.
