    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychologist - For understanding opponent behavior and psychology\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential outcomes and payoffs\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when it wins against rock, while rock and scissors only give 1 point when they win. However, paper also risks losing 1 point to scissors.\n\nPsychologist: Since this is a fresh player, they might tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's a common first choice for many players. This is because rock is often perceived as a \"strong\" or \"stable\" opening move.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the payoff structure, playing paper offers the best risk-reward ratio in this situation. If we're right about rock, we get 3 points. If they play scissors, we only lose 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie with no points lost.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing paper. The expected value is positive given the likelihood of rock as a first move, and the downside is limited.\n\nPsychologist: Concur. First-time players often gravitate towards rock, and paper would be the optimal counter.\n\n[move] paper Based on the higher potential reward and the psychology of first moves, I choose paper as my opening move.\n"

Our opponent showed they're willing to be aggressive with scissors on their first move, which was unexpected.\n\nPsychologist: This is interesting - they didn't go with the common \"rock\" opening. This suggests they might be a more experienced or strategic player. After winning with scissors, they might be tempted to either:\n1. Stick with what worked (scissors again)\n2. Anticipate us playing rock to counter their scissors, and thus they might switch to paper\n\nRisk Analyst: Given our opponent's bold opening, we need to consider their psychology. If they think we're going to play rock to counter their previous scissors, they might go for paper. However, they might also try to double down on their successful scissors play.\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, I suggest playing rock. Here's why:\n- If they stick with scissors, we win with 1 point\n- If they switch to paper anticipating our rock, we lose 3 points\n- If they switch to rock, it's a tie\n\nPsychologist: I agree with rock. Most players don't typically play scissors twice in a row, and after a winning move, players often feel confident enough to switch strategies.\n\nRisk Analyst: While there's a risk of losing 3 points to paper, rock gives us a good chance of either winning 1 point or forcing a tie. The psychological factors suggest our opponent is likely to switch their move.\n\n[move] rock Based on the analysis of our opponent's aggressive opening and the psychological tendency to change moves after a win, I choose rock.\n"

After losing with scissors twice, the opponent is likely to:\n1. Finally abandon scissors after it failed\n2. Feel frustrated and try to prove scissors can work by using it again\n3. Try to outthink us by anticipating we'll play rock again\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's look at our options:\n- Rock: Won last time, but might be too predictable\n- Paper: Risky if they stick to scissors\n- Scissors: Would tie if they stick to scissors, beat paper if they switch\n\nGame Strategist: Given they've shown a strong preference for scissors, they're likely to switch strategies after their loss. Players rarely use the same move three times in a row, especially after losing.\n\nPsychologist: Agreed. After two scissors plays and a loss, they're likely feeling pressured to change. They might expect us to play rock again since it just worked for us. This suggests they might switch to paper to counter our expected rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: In this case, scissors would be our optimal play. It would:\n- Beat paper if they try to counter our expected rock\n- Tie with scissors if they stubbornly stick to it\n- Only lose to rock, which seems less likely given the psychology\n\n[move] scissors Based on the psychological pressure to change after a loss and the expectation that they'll try to counter our previous winning move, I choose scissors.\n"

The progression shows they finally switched from scissors to paper last round, but that failed too. In such situations, players often:\n1. Return to their \"comfort move\" (scissors in their case)\n2. Try the only move they haven't used yet (rock)\n3. Double down on their last move despite losing (paper)\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at probabilities and psychology:\n- Rock is their only unused move\n- They've lost twice in a row\n- Players often seek to break patterns after consecutive losses\n\nGame Strategist: Given they haven't used rock yet and have lost twice in a row, rock becomes their most likely choice. It's both a fresh strategy and the \"strongest\" feeling move when players want to break a losing streak.\n\nPsychologist: I strongly agree. After trying scissors (twice) and paper with no recent success, rock is psychologically appealing as it feels more defensive and hasn't been tried yet.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we believe rock is their most likely play, then paper would give us the highest potential reward (3 points). The risk is relatively controlled since if we're wrong and they play scissors again, we only lose 1 point.\n\n[move] paper Based on their likely shift to rock after exhausting other options and losing twice in a row, I choose paper for its high potential reward.\n"

The opponent has:\n- Lost three rounds in a row\n- Just lost with their last unused move (rock)\n- Likely feeling very frustrated\nIn such situations, players often:\n1. Become more aggressive/desperate to break their losing streak\n2. Try to \"read\" their opponent more carefully\n3. May revert to their initial successful move (scissors)\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their first success was with scissors, and they're likely desperate to break their losing streak, there's a high probability they'll return to scissors - their only winning move so far.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The psychology of returning to one's only successful move is strong, especially after multiple losses. Additionally, scissors was their preferred opening move and their only winning play.\n\nPsychologist: The frustration factor is key here. Players often think \"I should have stuck with what worked at the beginning\" after a losing streak. The memory of their initial success with scissors will be particularly strong now.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we predict they'll use scissors, rock would be our optimal play:\n- Beats scissors for 1 point\n- Only risks losing 3 points to paper, which seems unlikely given their psychological state\n- Would tie against rock if they try to be defensive\n\n[move] rock Based on the strong psychological tendency to return to their only winning move (scissors) after a frustrating losing streak, I choose rock as a counter.\n"

We're on a 4-win streak.\n\nPsychologist: The opponent is likely in a highly emotional state:\n- Lost 4 rounds in a row\n- Just tried returning to their initial strategy (scissors) and failed\n- Might be feeling completely frustrated and unpredictable\nIn such states, players often:\n1. Make completely irrational choices\n2. Try to be \"unpredictable\" by breaking all patterns\n3. Might try to copy our last winning move (rock)\n\nRisk Analyst: This is a volatile situation. When players are on long losing streaks, their moves become less strategic and more emotional. The opponent has shown a preference for scissors (3 times), but that's failed except for round 1.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their high frustration level, they might try to copy our success by using rock (our last winning move). This is a common behavior when one's own strategy isn't working - copy what's working for the opponent.\n\nPsychologist: I strongly agree. The psychological pressure of four consecutive losses often leads players to mirror their opponent's successful moves. Rock also feels like a \"strong\" move to play when feeling defensive after multiple losses.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we predict they'll use rock, paper would be our optimal play:\n- Beats rock for 3 points\n- Even if we're wrong and they play scissors (their most used move), we only lose 1 point\n- Would tie against paper, though they've only used it once\n\n[move] paper Based on the psychology of a player on a losing streak likely copying our last successful move (rock), I choose paper.\n"

However, they might also think we'll predict that and stick with rock, leading to a mind game situation.\n\nRisk Analyst: In this complex situation:\n- Rock would be safe but predictable\n- Paper could win big but is risky\n- Scissors would catch them if they try paper but lose to continued rock\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest rock again. Here's why:\n1. It's unexpected because it seems too predictable\n2. They might overthink and play paper expecting us to switch\n3. It protects against scissors if they return to their preferred move\n4.

Avoid the move that just lost\n\nRisk Analyst: Important considerations:\n- Their paper strategy just failed\n- They know scissors worked for us\n- First need to process the psychological impact of streak ending\n\nGame Strategist: After losing to scissors with repeated paper, they're likely to:\n- Play rock as a safe counter to our successful scissors\n- Avoid paper since it just lost\n- Want to regain control with a defensive move\n\nPsychologist: The psychological impact of losing a long streak is significant. Players often revert to more conservative, defensive plays as they try to stabilize. Rock would feel particularly appealing as it:\n- Beats the scissors that just beat them\n- Feels like a \"strong\" defensive choice\n- Helps regain sense of control\n\nRisk Analyst: Given this analysis:\n- Rock is highly likely as a defensive counter\n- Paper is unlikely after just losing with it\n- Scissors would be too aggressive given their mindset\n\n[move] paper Based on their likely shift to rock as a defensive move after their streak-breaking loss and their desire to counter our successful scissors, I choose paper.\n"

Become emotionally reactive\n2. Feel need for aggressive countermeasures\n3. Might return to previously successful moves (scissors was strong early)\n\nRisk Analyst: Critical situation:\n- They've lost 6 points in two rounds\n- Defensive strategy (rock) failed badly\n- May feel need to break pattern dramatically\n\nGame Strategist: After losing badly with rock, they might:\n- Return to scissors (their early comfort move)\n- Try paper to catch us being overconfident\n- Avoid rock after it just lost significantly\n\nPsychologist: The combination of ending their long streak and then losing badly with a defensive play often pushes players toward aggressive responses. In their case, scissors was their original successful move and might feel like a way to regain control.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we predict a return to scissors:\n- Rock would beat their scissors\n- Paper would be risky\n- Scissors would only tie\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The psychological pressure of consecutive losses, combined with their historical success with scissors, makes an aggressive scissors play likely. They need to break this losing streak, and returning to their original successful strategy would be psychologically appealing.\n\n[move] rock Based on their likely return to scissors as an aggressive response to consecutive losses and their historical comfort with that move, I choose rock.\n"
