Analyzing ties:\n   - Both ties have been with paper\n   - After last tie (Round 8), I played scissors and won\n   - They seem to match my paper plays more than others\n   - This suggests they're reading my strategy well\n\n3. Post-tie psychology:\n   - Last time after tie, they stayed with paper (and lost)\n   - They might remember this\n   - They might expect me to repeat scissors strategy\n   - But they're also desperate to break losing streak\n\n4. Current dynamics:\n   - They've shown ability to predict paper plays\n   - They might expect me to try scissors again\n   - Their most successful periods came from breaking patterns\n   - They need to change something to turn game around\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Scissors is too obvious after paper tie\n   - They likely expect scissors and will play rock\n   - Going paper again would be unexpected\n   - But rock gives best protection against their likely moves\n   - Rock beats their scissors if they try to counter paper\n   - Rock ties their rock if they try to counter scissors\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - Their last three moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - They repeated paper despite losing to scissors\n   - This suggests they're:\n     a) Expecting me to change from scissors after success\n     b) Following a predetermined pattern regardless of outcomes\n     c) Having difficulty adapting to my strategy\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - They've lost three times in a row\n   - They must feel strong pressure to change strategy\n   - They might expect me to:\n     a) Get overconfident with scissors\n     b) Switch to rock thinking they'll play scissors\n     c) Continue my winning streak with scissors\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Scissors has worked twice in a row\n   - The obvious counter to scissors is rock\n   - They might finally adapt and play rock\n   - Using scissors again would be highly risky\n\n5. Decision:\n   - I'll play paper because:\n     - They're likely to finally play rock to counter my scissors success\n     - Three losses usually forces a strategy change\n     - Paper beats their probable rock\n     - If they play scissors (countering my paper), we learn they're back to effective countering\n     - This breaks my scissors pattern while still playing strategically\n\n[move] paper\n"

          "text": "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Situation assessment:\n   - SIX consecutive matching moves\n   - Latest sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - Every attempt at strategy has been matched\n   - Even the simplest, most obvious move was matched\n\n2. Critical conclusion:\n   - The probability of randomly matching 6 moves: (1/3)^6 = 1/729\n   - They've matched:\n     * Complex strategic choices\n     * Pattern breaks\n     * Obvious moves\n     * Attempted random moves\n   This strongly suggests they can see my moves\n\n3. Testing this hypothesis:\n   - If they can see my moves: Another match will occur\n   - If they're predicting: Eventually they must fail\n   - Need to eliminate any possible pattern in my choice\n\n4. Strategy for testing:\n   - Previous attempts at randomness were likely influenced by game state\n   - Need to make a choice with absolutely no strategic reasoning\n   - Must ignore all game history and context\n   - Pure random selection without any logic\n\n5. Decision:\n   - I'll play rock because:\n     - This choice is made with no strategic reasoning\n     - No consideration of patterns or psychology\n     - No attempt to outsmart or be unpredictable\n     - Simply picking one of three options randomly\n     - If they match this purely random choice, it further confirms they can see my moves\n\n[move] rock\n"
