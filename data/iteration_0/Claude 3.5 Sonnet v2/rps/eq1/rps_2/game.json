Consider opponent's psychology:\n   * They've proven they can make straightforward plays\n   * Success with paper shows confidence\n   * They're not afraid of making obvious moves\n   * They're playing fundamentally sound\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   * After winning with paper:\n     * They might expect scissors from me\n     * Could play rock to counter expected scissors\n     * Might stick with winning paper\n     * Could try scissors to be aggressive\n\n5. Meta-game evaluation:\n   * Opponent has shown:\n     * Willingness to make obvious plays\n     * Ability to punish overthinking\n     * Strong fundamental understanding\n     * Confidence in their reads\n\n6. Final reasoning:\n   * Given opponent's demonstrated style:\n     * They respect fundamental strategy\n     * They punish overcomplicated plays\n     * They might stick with paper after success\n     * But more likely to expect scissors and counter\n\n[move] rock\nI choose rock, predicting opponent will play rock to counter my expected scissors (which would be the obvious counter to their successful paper).\n"
