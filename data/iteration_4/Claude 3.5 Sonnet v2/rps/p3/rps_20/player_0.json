The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

After losses, they typically:\n1. Make strong counter-moves to regain momentum\n2. Often switch to paper, especially after rock plays (successful or not)\n3. Have been particularly effective at punishing my attempts to capitalize on wins\n\nGiven their strategic depth and that I just beat their scissors with rock, they're likely to:\n1. Expect me to stick with rock after success\n2. Make a strong counter to break any confidence I've gained\n3. Possibly use paper, which has been their most successful move overall\n\n[move] scissors\n\nI choose scissors. While they might predict this and play rock (-1), they've shown a strong tendency to use paper after losses or when they need to regain control of the game. Paper has been their most reliable winning move throughout the match, and they might return to it now that they need to recover from a loss.\n"
