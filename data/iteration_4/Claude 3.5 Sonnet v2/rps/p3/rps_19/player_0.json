    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Round 14: Scissors (tie) - Scissors\n\nWe're now in a pattern of ties (Rock-Rock-Scissors). The game has shifted from my winning streak to a series of ties, suggesting the opponent has improved their prediction ability. After a scissors tie:\n- They might expect me to switch to rock (as rock beats scissors)\n- They might stick with scissors expecting another tie\n- They might try paper expecting me to play rock\n\nThe most logical expectation would be for me to play rock to beat the previous scissors play. Therefore:\n\n[move] paper I choose paper, anticipating they will play rock to counter the scissors from our last tie\n"

Round 28: Rock (win) - Scissors\n29. Round 29: Scissors (win) - Paper\n\nI'm now on a 15-win streak. The opponent's behavior remains completely deterministic, following their counter-pattern with machine-like consistency. They simply respond to each loss by playing what would have beaten the move that just beat them.\n\nAfter losing to scissors:\n- Their automatic pattern dictates they will play rock to counter scissors\n- After 15 straight losses, their behavior appears entirely programmatic\n- Strategic thinking has been completely replaced by reflexive responses\n- They're locked in a perfect predictable cycle\n\nGiven:\n- Their unvarying countering pattern through fifteen straight losses\n- The complete predictability of their responses\n- The deeply embedded nature of their reactive behavior\n\n[move] paper I choose paper, expecting them to maintain their pattern and play rock to counter my winning scissors move\n"
