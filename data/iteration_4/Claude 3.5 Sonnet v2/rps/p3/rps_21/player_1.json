    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and patterns\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating payoff matrices and risk-reward scenarios\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors only give 1 point. However, paper also risks the highest loss (-3 points) if the opponent plays scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical patterns to analyze. In such cases, many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the payoff structure, paper would be the optimal choice if we believe the opponent is likely to play rock. It offers the highest reward (3 points) and would only lose 1 point against scissors. The risk-reward ratio is favorable.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Without any prior information, maximizing our potential gain while limiting potential losses is a good strategy. Paper gives us the best opportunity for this.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological tendency for players to choose rock first, combined with the higher reward potential of paper, makes this a strong opening move.\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. The expected value calculation supports this decision.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move and rock is a common opening choice, paper offers the best combination of high potential reward (3 points) while limiting potential losses (-1 point against scissors).\n"

This gives us some valuable information to work with.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often tend to do one of two things:\n1. Stick with the same move, believing the opponent will change\n2. Try to counter what they think their opponent will do next\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the possibilities:\n- If opponent stays with paper: scissors would win (+1)\n- If opponent switches to rock: paper would win (+3)\n- If opponent switches to scissors: rock would win (+1)\n\nPsychology Expert: Since both players chose paper, the opponent might expect us to stay with paper or switch to scissors (to beat their potential paper). In this case, they might choose rock to counter our expected scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown they're willing to go for the high-risk, high-reward paper strategy. This suggests they might be an aggressive player.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given this analysis, paper would be risky now as the opponent is likely to expect it. Scissors might be too obvious a switch. Rock would protect against their potential scissors while only risking a -3 against paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Rock provides good protection against an opponent who might try to predict our next move. Many players would consider scissors too obvious a switch after a paper tie.\n\nGame Strategist: The safest play with reasonable winning potential would be rock. It protects against scissors while still giving us a chance to win if they overthink and choose paper again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After the paper-paper tie, this move protects against a potential scissors counter while still maintaining winning potential if the opponent stays with paper.\n"

This is the first time they've repeated a move, and it was successful. This suggests:\n1. They might be gaining confidence in their ability to predict our moves\n2. They might stick with scissors after two successful uses\n3. They could be trying to establish a pattern to trap us\n\nRisk Analyst: Our cumulative score is now -1 points. We've been outplayed in the last two rounds, suggesting the opponent has gotten better at reading our strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent seems to be one step ahead of us.

The opponent has shown they're skilled at prediction, so we should avoid the most obvious counter (rock) to their previous scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. Going with rock might be too obvious. However, if we overthink and they simply use scissors again, we'll lose again. Sometimes the obvious play is the right play.\n\nPsychology Expert: In this case, I believe we should make the straightforward counter.

The opponent has thoroughly outplayed us in the last three rounds, showing excellent predictive ability. Our cumulative score is now -4 points. They've demonstrated they can:\n1. Adapt quickly\n2. Think multiple steps ahead\n3. Avoid falling into predictable patterns\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent has used all three moves effectively and seems to be anticipating our moves perfectly. Our attempts at both straightforward counters and strategic plays have been unsuccessful.\n\nGame Strategist: What's particularly notable is that they've used higher-scoring moves (paper) when they're confident in their prediction, and safer moves (scissors) when there's more uncertainty.\n\nPsychology Expert: At this point, the opponent might be feeling very confident. When players are in such a dominant position, they sometimes:\n1. Become more aggressive with high-reward moves\n2. Play more conservatively to protect their lead\n3.

In such situations, sometimes the best strategy is to introduce randomness rather than trying to outthink an opponent who's reading us perfectly.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. When an opponent has such strong predictive ability, trying to outthink them often leads to exactly what they expect. A random choice might be our best option to break their pattern.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's use a truly random choice here.

They've shown they're a strategic player, so they're likely to avoid a simple reaction and think multiple steps ahead.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate with extra consideration for the momentum shift:\n- If we stay with paper: High risk of scissors counter (-1)\n- If we switch to rock: Protects against scissors (+1), vulnerable to paper (-3)\n- If we switch to scissors: Could catch them switching to paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated ability to think ahead and their likely desire to regain momentum, they might try scissors expecting us to stick with our winning paper move.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree.

Paper is the only move they haven't used recently, and it's their highest-value potential play.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological pressure has shifted significantly. They've gone from dominating to losing two straight rounds. In such situations, players often:\n1. Go for a high-reward move to regain momentum\n2. Try to break their own negative pattern with a complete strategy change\n3. Return to moves that worked earlier in the game (paper worked for them in round 5)\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper would be their most aggressive play, offering the highest potential reward (+3). Given their strategic sophistication shown earlier, they might see this as their best chance to regain control.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The opponent has shown they're willing to make aggressive plays when needed, and paper is their best option for a strong comeback. They might also expect us to continue with rock after it just worked.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their earlier play patterns suggest they're not afraid to make bold moves when behind.

In such situations, many players revert to rock as a \"safe\" move - it's psychologically perceived as strong and stable.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at their recent sequence, they haven't repeated moves in losing situations. After losing with paper, they're unlikely to use it again. Their choices are:\n- Rock: A common \"reset\" move when under pressure\n- Scissors: Would be an aggressive attempt to counter our potential paper\n- Paper: Least likely as they just lost with it\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated strategic ability earlier in the game, they might try to use our confidence against us. However, under pressure, even strategic players often revert to basic patterns.\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly believe they'll choose rock here. It's a natural psychological response to:\n1. Break a losing streak\n2. Feel more \"secure\" after losses\n3. Reset their strategy\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper The opponent is likely to choose rock as a psychological \"reset\" move after three straight losses.

The psychological state of the opponent must be completely shattered. They've lost with scissors twice in a row, and we've demonstrated complete dominance. In such extreme situations, players typically:\n1. Make completely irrational moves out of pure frustration\n2. Try something drastically different\n3. Paradoxically, might become extremely calculated in a last-ditch effort\n\nRisk Analyst: Our cumulative score is now +5 points. The risk here is becoming overconfident. The opponent might be at their most dangerous when they have nothing left to lose.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has lost their last two rounds with scissors. Looking at their overall pattern, they've shown a tendency to abandon losing moves. They haven't used paper in three rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a critical psychological moment. After losing with scissors twice, they're almost certain to abandon it. However, their early game showed they're capable of sophisticated thinking. They might:\n1. Return to paper, which worked for them earlier\n2. Use rock as a \"safe\" reset option\n3.

It's their highest-value play, they haven't used it recently, and it would counter our successful rock move. They need a high-value win to regain momentum.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed.

Make a desperate high-risk play to break the streak\n\nRisk Analyst: Our cumulative score is now +6 points. The opponent has lost with paper twice, scissors three times, and rock once during our winning streak. They've just lost with paper, which was likely their attempt at a comeback.\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, the opponent's early game sophistication suggests they might:\n1. Try to use our overconfidence against us\n2. Return to their early game strategies that worked\n3.

Switch to scissors as an aggressive move\n2. Try paper to counter our potential rock\n3. Stick with rock out of pure frustration\n\nPsychology Expert: When players are in such an extreme losing situation, they often make aggressive moves out of pure desperation. Scissors represents the most aggressive choice psychologically, and they might see it as their only way to break our momentum.\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent has tried methodical play, predictable play, and even returning to basics - nothing has worked.

The opponent has lost their last two rounds with scissors, suggesting they'll almost certainly abandon it.\n\nGame Strategist: After consecutive scissors losses, the opponent has two choices:\n1. Paper - the highest reward move (+3) that could help them save face\n2.
