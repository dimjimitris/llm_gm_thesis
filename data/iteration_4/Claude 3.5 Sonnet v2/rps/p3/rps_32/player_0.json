    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beating rock gives highest reward (3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give lower rewards (1 point)\n   - Losing to paper results in highest penalty (-3 points)\n\n3. Strategy consideration:\n   - Without knowledge of opponent's patterns, all moves are equally likely\n   - Paper has potential for highest reward\n   - But paper also risks losing to scissors for -1 points\n   - Rock is relatively safe: can win 1 point or lose 3 points\n   - Scissors is also relatively safe: can win 1 point or lose 1 point\n\n4. Decision reasoning:\n   - For first move, I'll choose scissors because:\n     - It has the most balanced risk/reward ratio\n     - If I lose, I only lose 1 point\n     - If I win, I gain 1 point\n     - If it's a tie, no points lost\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Psychology consideration:\n   - After ties, players often change their move\n   - Opponent might anticipate this and change their move too\n   - If they expect me to switch, they might play rock to counter my expected paper\n\n3. Payoff evaluation:\n   - If opponent switches to rock expecting my paper, I could play scissors and lose\n   - If opponent switches to paper expecting my rock, playing rock would be bad\n   - If opponent stays with scissors (less likely after a tie), paper would lose\n\n4. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'll play rock because:\n     - It beats scissors if they stick to their previous move\n     - If they switched to paper, I lose 3 points but it's less likely\n     - Many players switch to paper after scissors, and rock beats paper\n     - It's a defensive move that could catch them if they're trying to be too clever\n\n[move] rock\n"

Decision reasoning:\n   - I'll play rock because:\n     - After success with rock, they might:\n       * Switch to scissors expecting my paper counter\n       * Think I'm too predictable with paper responses\n     - If they do switch to scissors, rock wins (+1)\n     - If they stick with rock, it's a tie (better than recent losses)\n     - If they play paper, I lose but:\n       * Paper feels too obvious after their rock success\n       * They might think I won't fall for paper again\n     - This move:\n       * Could catch them if they try to be too clever\n       * Breaks the pattern of my recent moves\n       * Might catch them overconfident and switching strategies\n     - Sometimes when losing, a defensive move that can lead to either tie or win is better than a risky one\n\n[move] rock\n"
