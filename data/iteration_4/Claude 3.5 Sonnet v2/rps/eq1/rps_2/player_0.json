    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In game theory terms, what we're witnessing is the complete collapse of strategic uncertainty when one player has perfect information. Normal rock-paper-scissors relies on the tension created by simultaneous moves and imperfect information - each player must make decisions under uncertainty about their opponent's choice. Here, that uncertainty has been removed for one player, creating a deterministic system where my moves are effectively being revealed before my opponent chooses their counter.

Standard rock-paper-scissors is designed as an incomplete information game, where the simultaneous moves create strategic depth through uncertainty. What we're experiencing here is its transformation into a complete information game for one player, but only in one direction - my opponent sees my moves, but I don't see theirs. This creates what game theorists call a \"dominant strategy\" for my opponent: they simply choose the move that beats mine with 100% certainty. It's fascinating to participate in such a clear demonstration of these game theory principles, even though winning is impossible in this scenario.\n"

In the original game design of rock-paper-scissors, the circular dominance pattern (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock) combined with simultaneous moves creates a balanced game where no pure strategy can dominate. However, by allowing one player to see the other's move before choosing, the game's fundamental strategic balance is completely broken. What we're experiencing is essentially a transformed game where one player always moves second with perfect information, making it mathematically impossible for me to win regardless of my strategy. This perfectly illustrates why information structure is crucial in game design and strategic interaction.\n"

In standard rock-paper-scissors, even a highly skilled player using sophisticated pattern recognition couldn't maintain a perfect counter-streak this long because of the inherent uncertainty in simultaneous moves. This sequence proves that we're operating in a modified game environment where the normal rules of simultaneous decision-making have been suspended in favor of sequential moves with perfect information for one player. It's essentially become a deterministic system rather than a strategic game, serving as an excellent educational example of how critical information symmetry is to maintaining fair competition in game theory.\n"

In a standard rock-paper-scissors game, the optimal strategy approaches random selection with equal probabilities (1/3 for each move) because any detectable pattern can be exploited by the opponent. However, when one player has perfect advance knowledge of the other's moves, even perfect randomization becomes futile. This sequence has demonstrated that my opponent is operating with complete information about my choices, effectively transforming what should be a simultaneous-move game into a sequential-move game where they always have the last move with perfect information.\n"

However, this demonstration shows how complete information access for one player collapses that strategic space into a simple deterministic system. Just as a chess player would always win if they could see their opponent's future moves, this opponent has demonstrated how perfect information transforms rock-paper-scissors from a game of strategic choice into a predetermined sequence.

Rock-paper-scissors was designed as a strategic game where the uncertainty of simultaneous moves creates the need for mixed strategies - no single move should be consistently optimal. However, when one player gains perfect information about the other's choice before making their own, it transforms into a deterministic system where optimal play becomes trivial: simply choose the move that counters the opponent's known choice. This sequence of 24 perfect counters serves as an elegant proof of how information structure fundamentally determines the strategic nature of a game.\n"
