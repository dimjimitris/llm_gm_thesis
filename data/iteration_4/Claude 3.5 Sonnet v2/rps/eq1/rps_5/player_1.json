    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors without prior information:\n   - Rock, paper, and scissors each have a 1/3 chance of winning\n   - Each move is equally strong in a purely random game\n\n3. Common player psychology in first rounds:\n   - Many players tend to choose rock as their first move\n   - Rock is often seen as a \"strong\" opening move\n   - This might make paper a good counter-strategy\n\n4. However, if the opponent anticipates this thinking:\n   - They might choose scissors to counter my paper\n   - This creates a mind game scenario\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Without any prior data, trying to outsmart an unknown opponent might be overthinking\n   - A balanced approach might be best for the first move\n   - Paper gives me a good chance against predicted rock, while accepting the risk against scissors\n\n[move] paper\n"

Psychology after a tie:\n   - Players often change their move after a tie\n   - They might expect me to change my move\n   - They might think I'll stick with paper again\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - If opponent expects me to change, they might predict rock or scissors from me\n   - If they expect me to stay with paper, they'll likely switch to scissors\n   - Most players tend to shift after a tie\n\n4. Game theory:\n   - Scissors would be risky if they switch to rock\n   - Rock would be strong if they switch to scissors\n   - Paper would be surprising but risky\n\n5.
