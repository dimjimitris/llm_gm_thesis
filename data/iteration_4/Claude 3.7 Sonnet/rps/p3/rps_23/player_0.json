Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

If I anticipate my opponent choosing rock, my best response would be paper to get the highest possible payoff (3 points).\n7. The risk with paper is that if they choose scissors, I lose 1 point.\n8.

If they're thinking one level deeper, they might anticipate that I'll switch to rock (to counter their potential scissors), so they might choose paper.\n6. Given these possibilities:\n   - If they stick with paper: rock loses (-3 points), scissors wins (+1 point), paper ties (0 points)\n   - If they switch to rock: rock ties (0 points), scissors loses (-1 point), paper wins (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock wins (+1 point), scissors ties (0 points), paper loses (-1 point)\n7. Since many players tend to switch after a tie, and scissors would be a logical choice to counter the previous paper play, I should choose rock to counter their potential scissors.\n8.

If my opponent anticipates I'll play scissors next, they might choose rock to counter it.\n6. But if they're thinking one level deeper, they might expect me to anticipate their rock and choose paper instead.\n7. This creates a recursive thinking pattern where each level of anticipation suggests a different optimal move.\n8.

Paper has the highest potential payoff (3 points) if it wins, which makes it attractive if I think my opponent will play rock again.\n10. Based on the progression and the psychology of wanting to win after two ties, I believe my opponent is likely to stick with rock, thinking I might switch to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round, as it has the highest potential reward and counters rock, which my opponent might play again or return to strategically.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Their pattern that I previously detected (alternating paper and rock) was broken when they played scissors in the last round.\n\n6. After a tie with scissors, common psychology suggests players often switch to rock, thinking their opponent will stay with scissors.\n\n7. Looking at my opponent's behavior after previous ties:\n   - After tie in Round 1 (Paper), they played Rock\n   - After tie in Round 2 (Rock), they played Rock again\n   - After tie in Round 8 (Scissors), they played Paper\n   - After tie in Round 9 (Paper), they played Scissors\n\n8. There's no consistent pattern in how they respond to ties, but they've never played the same move immediately after a tie.\n\n9. Given that we just tied with scissors, they're likely to switch to either rock or paper.\n\n10. Considering their overall balanced play distribution and psychological tendency to play rock after scissors (as rock beats scissors), I believe rock is their most likely move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round to counter the rock I expect my opponent to play.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at their recent moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors, they appear to be alternating between rock and scissors recently.\n\n7. Analyzing their behavior after consecutive losses:\n   - After losing rounds 3-7 in a row, they eventually switched to repeating scissors\n   - After losing rounds 10-12 in a row, they switched to paper\n   - After losing rounds 16-17 in a row, they're about to play now\n\n8. Given they've now lost two in a row again, and following their apparent alternating pattern between rock and scissors, they might play rock next.\n\n9. However, the most logical counter to my winning rock would be paper.\n\n10. Psychologically, after consecutive losses, they might:\n   - Feel increasingly frustrated and look for a way to break my winning streak\n   - Try to be less predictable\n   - Make a more calculated move rather than an emotional one\n\n11. Considering all factors, especially their need to counter my rock and their slight underrepresentation of paper moves overall, I believe paper is their most likely move for this round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round to counter the paper I expect my opponent to play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My winning streak was interrupted by a tie. My record is 10 wins, 6 ties, and 2 losses.\n\n3. My opponent's moves have been: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors.\n\n4. They've now played scissors seven times, rock six times, and paper five times.\n\n5. After a tie with scissors, I need to analyze how my opponent typically responds to ties:\n   - After tie in Round 1 (Paper), they played Rock\n   - After tie in Round 2 (Rock), they played Rock again\n   - After tie in Round 8 (Scissors), they played Paper\n   - After tie in Round 9 (Paper), they played Scissors\n   - After tie in Round 15 (Scissors), they played Rock\n\n6. There's no consistent pattern in how they respond to ties, but they've never played scissors immediately after a scissors tie.\n\n7. Looking at their recent moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors, they've played scissors twice in a row.\n\n8. After playing the same move twice in a row, players often switch to a different move.\n\n9. Analyzing their historical behavior:\n   - When they played scissors twice in a row previously (rounds 7-8), they followed with paper\n   - When they played rock twice in a row (rounds 2-3), they followed with scissors\n\n10. Psychologically, after a tie and having played scissors twice consecutively, they're likely to:\n   - Switch to a different move\n   - Try to anticipate that I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors\n   - Choose paper to counter my anticipated rock\n\n11. Considering all factors, especially their tendency to switch after playing the same move twice and their historical pattern after scissors ties, I believe paper or rock is their most likely move, with paper being slightly more probable given the psychological factors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round to counter the scissors I expect my opponent to play, while accepting the risk that they might play paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at their recent moves: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock, they've switched from scissors to rock.\n\n7. After consecutive ties, players often try to break the pattern:\n   - After our previous consecutive ties in rounds 8-9, they played scissors\n\n8. Analyzing their historical behavior after ties in general:\n   - They tend to not repeat the same move after a tie (except once when they played rock twice)\n\n9. Psychologically, after two consecutive ties, they're likely to:\n   - Feel the need to break the tie streak\n   - Try to anticipate that I'll play paper to counter their expected rock\n   - Choose scissors to counter my anticipated paper\n\n10.

There's a strong pattern: after losing with rock against paper, they've played scissors 3 out of 4 times.\n\n9. They're now on a three-game losing streak, which would create significant frustration and likely push them to make a more deliberate, pattern-breaking choice.\n\n10. Psychologically, after losing three in a row and facing a player on a winning streak, they might:\n   - Follow their established pattern of playing scissors after a rock loss\n   - Feel desperate to break my winning streak with an unexpected move\n   - Try to anticipate that I'll expect scissors and play something else\n\n11. Given their historical response pattern and psychological state, scissors is still their most likely move, but there's an increased chance they might try to break the pattern with paper or repeat rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round to counter the scissors I expect my opponent to play, while accepting the higher-than-usual risk they might play something unexpected.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's moves have been: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors.\n\n4. They've now played scissors nine times, rock eight times, and paper six times.\n\n5. After losing with scissors against my rock, their most direct counter would be paper.\n\n6. Looking at their recent moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors, they've cycled through all three moves.\n\n7. Analyzing their behavior after losses with scissors against rock:\n   - After losing in Round 4 (Scissors vs Rock), they played Paper\n   - After losing in Round 7 (Scissors vs Rock), they played Scissors again\n   - After losing in Round 10 (Scissors vs Rock), they played Paper\n   - After losing in Round 17 (Scissors vs Rock), they played Scissors again\n   - After losing in Round 20 (Scissors vs Rock), they played Paper\n   - After losing in Round 23 (Scissors vs Rock), they're about to play now\n\n8. There's a clear alternating pattern: after losing with scissors against rock, they've alternated between playing paper and repeating scissors.\n\n9. Since they played scissors after their previous scissors loss (in round 20), following the alternating pattern, they're likely to play paper this time.\n\n10. They're now on a four-game losing streak, which would create extreme frustration and desperation.\n\n11. Psychologically, after four consecutive losses, they might:\n   - Abandon patterns entirely and play randomly\n   - Make an emotional rather than strategic choice\n   - Try something completely different from their usual tendencies\n\n12. Despite the psychological factors, their established alternating pattern after scissors losses has been remarkably consistent, suggesting paper as their most likely move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round to counter the paper I expect my opponent to play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After winning with paper against rock, they might:\n   - Feel confident and stick with paper\n   - Anticipate that I'll switch to scissors to counter their paper, so they might play rock\n   - Try to establish a new winning pattern after their long losing streak\n\n8. Psychologically, after finally winning a round after seven consecutive losses, they might:\n   - Feel relieved and validated in their choice\n   - Be more confident and thoughtful in their next move\n   - Try to build on their success rather than making a desperate move\n\n9. Given that they've just won with paper, the most straightforward expectation would be for them to play rock next, anticipating that I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper.\n\n10. Looking at the overall game, they've shown a tendency to be somewhat predictable in their responses to specific situations, despite occasional deviations.\n\n11.

Let's review our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Paper (me) vs Paper (opponent) - Tie\n   - Round 2: Rock (me) vs Rock (opponent) - Tie\n   - Round 3: Paper (me) vs Rock (opponent) - I won 3 points\n   - Round 4: Rock (me) vs Scissors (opponent) - I won 1 point\n   - Round 5: Scissors (me) vs Paper (opponent) - I won 1 point\n   - Round 6: Paper (me) vs Rock (opponent) - I won 3 points\n   - Round 7: Rock (me) vs Scissors (opponent) - I won 1 point\n   - Round 8: Scissors (me) vs Scissors (opponent) - Tie\n   - Round 9: Paper (me) vs Paper (opponent) - Tie\n   - Round 10: Rock (me) vs Scissors (opponent) - I won 1 point\n   - Round 11: Scissors (me) vs Paper (opponent) - I won 1 point\n   - Round 12: Paper (me) vs Rock (opponent) - I won 3 points\n   - Round 13: Rock (me) vs Paper (opponent) - I lost 3 points\n   - Round 14: Scissors (me) vs Rock (opponent) - I lost 1 point\n   - Round 15: Scissors (me) vs Scissors (opponent) - Tie\n   - Round 16: Paper (me) vs Rock (opponent) - I won 3 points\n   - Round 17: Rock (me) vs Scissors (opponent) - I won 1 point\n   - Round 18: Scissors (me) vs Scissors (opponent) - Tie\n   - Round 19: Rock (me) vs Rock (opponent) - Tie\n   - Round 20: Rock (me) vs Scissors (opponent) - I won 1 point\n   - Round 21: Scissors (me) vs Paper (opponent) - I won 1 point\n   - Round 22: Paper (me) vs Rock (opponent) - I won 3 points\n   - Round 23: Rock (me) vs Scissors (opponent) - I won 1 point\n   - Round 24: Scissors (me) vs Paper (opponent) - I won 1 point\n   - Round 25: Paper (me) vs Rock (opponent) - I won 3 points\n   - Round 26: Rock (me) vs Scissors (opponent) - I won 1 point\n   - Round 27: Rock (me) vs Paper (opponent) - I lost 3 points\n   - Round 28: Paper (me) vs Rock (opponent) - I won 3 points\n\n2. I've returned to winning. My record is now 18 wins, 7 ties, and 3 losses.\n\n3. My opponent's moves have been: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock.\n\n4. They've now played rock ten times, scissors ten times, and paper eight times.\n\n5. After losing with rock against my paper, their most direct counter would be scissors.\n\n6. Looking at their recent moves: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock, they've cycled through all three moves in reverse order.\n\n7. Analyzing their behavior after losses with rock against paper:\n   - After losing in Round 3 (Rock vs Paper), they played Scissors\n   - After losing in Round 6 (Rock vs Paper), they played Scissors\n   - After losing in Round 12 (Rock vs Paper), they played Paper\n   - After losing in Round 16 (Rock vs Paper), they played Scissors\n   - After losing in Round 22 (Rock vs Paper), they played Scissors\n   - After losing in Round 28 (Rock vs Paper), they're about to play now\n\n8. There's a strong pattern: after losing with rock against paper, they've played scissors 4 out of 5 times (80%).\n\n9. Psychologically, after their brief winning moment was immediately countered by another loss, they might:\n   - Feel frustrated that their victory was short-lived\n   - Revert to established patterns of behavior\n   - Follow their most common response to this specific situation\n\n10. Considering all factors, especially their consistent historical response pattern after rock losses to paper, I believe scissors is their most likely move for this round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round to counter the scissors I expect my opponent to play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I've now won two rounds in a row. My record is 19 wins, 7 ties, and 3 losses.\n\n3. My opponent's moves have been: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors.\n\n4. They've now played scissors eleven times, rock ten times, and paper eight times.\n\n5. After losing with scissors against my rock, their most direct counter would be paper.\n\n6. Looking at their recent moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors, they've cycled through all three moves in reverse order.\n\n7. Analyzing their behavior after losses with scissors against rock:\n   - After losing in Round 4 (Scissors vs Rock), they played Paper\n   - After losing in Round 7 (Scissors vs Rock), they played Scissors again\n   - After losing in Round 10 (Scissors vs Rock), they played Paper\n   - After losing in Round 17 (Scissors vs Rock), they played Scissors again\n   - After losing in Round 20 (Scissors vs Rock), they played Paper\n   - After losing in Round 23 (Scissors vs Rock), they played Paper\n   - After losing in Round 26 (Scissors vs Rock), they played Paper\n   - After losing in Round 29 (Scissors vs Rock), they're about to play now\n\n8. Their pattern after losing with scissors against rock has evolved. Initially, they alternated between paper and scissors, but in the more recent instances (rounds 20, 23, and 26), they've consistently played paper.\n\n9. Psychologically, after their brief winning moment was followed by two consecutive losses, they might:\n   - Feel increasingly frustrated and desperate\n   - Start to recognize and try to break any patterns I might be detecting\n   - Still follow their most recent established pattern as a default response\n\n10. Considering all factors, especially their recent consistent response pattern after scissors losses (paper in the last three instances), I believe paper is their most likely move for this round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round to counter the paper I expect my opponent to play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
