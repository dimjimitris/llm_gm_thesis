Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Paper beats rock (3 points vs -3), rock beats scissors (1 vs -1), and scissors beats paper (1 vs -1). This means paper has the highest potential reward.\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I need to consider common first-move tendencies in rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Many players choose rock as their first move because it feels \"strong\" or \"safe\"\n   - Some players might anticipate this and choose paper instead\n   - There's no definitive best first move without prior information\n\n3. If my opponent is likely to choose rock first (a common opening), then paper would be my optimal choice to win 3 points.\n\n4. Since paper has the highest potential payoff (3 points) and counters the statistically common first move (rock), it presents the best expected value.\n\n5. I'll choose paper for my first move to maximize potential gain against a fresh opponent.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent has shown an interesting pattern - they've played each move once, and seem to be adapting to previous rounds.\n\n3. After our tie with scissors, I need to predict their next move:\n   - They might assume I'll play rock next (advancing from scissors in a natural rock-paper-scissors sequence)\n   - They might play rock to beat my potential scissors repeat\n   - They might play paper to beat my potential rock\n\n4. If they're using simple pattern recognition, they might expect me to complete the cycle by playing rock, and counter with paper.\n\n5. Alternatively, they could be employing reverse psychology, expecting me to anticipate their paper and therefore playing scissors themselves.\n\n6. Since we both played scissors last time and tied, there's a tendency for players to move to rock after scissors (following the natural cycle).\n\n7.

My opponent might be falling into a cyclical pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock...\n\n4. However, they've just lost again to my paper play, which might prompt them to change strategy more deliberately.\n\n5.

Psychologically, after a loss, players often switch to what beat them - so they're highly likely to play scissors after losing to paper.\n\n8.

Let's review our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\n\n2. My opponent has maintained their three-move cycle throughout all 11 rounds:\n   - Rock in rounds 1, 4, 7, and 10\n   - Paper in rounds 2, 5, 8, and 11\n   - Scissors in rounds 3, 6, and 9\n\n3. If they continue this remarkably consistent pattern, they will play scissors in round 12.\n\n4. They've now lost five rounds in a row, which should be an extremely strong motivator to change strategy.\n\n5. However, their adherence to the pattern despite repeated losses suggests they might not be adapting strategically.\n\n6. At this point, I have to consider two main possibilities:\n   - They continue their pattern and play scissors (most likely based on history)\n   - They finally break pattern after multiple losses\n\n7. If they do play scissors per their pattern, rock would be my optimal counter.\n\n8. Even if they finally break pattern, rock remains a reasonable play since:\n   - It beats scissors (their pattern move)\n   - It beats a potential scissors play if they're trying to counter my expected paper\n   - If they play paper to counter my rock, I only lose 3 points (which I can afford given my winning streak)\n\n9. Given their demonstrated inflexibility so far, I believe they're most likely to continue their pattern with scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has maintained their three-move cycle without any deviation through all 28 rounds:\n   - Rock in rounds 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, and 28\n   - Paper in rounds 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, and 26\n   - Scissors in rounds 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27\n\n3. If they continue this perfectly consistent pattern, they will play paper in round 29.\n\n4. They've now lost twenty-two consecutive rounds, yet have shown absolutely no adaptation in their strategy.\n\n5. At this point, I can be virtually certain they will continue their pattern and play paper next.\n\n6. Given this extremely high confidence that they'll play paper, scissors would be my optimal counter.\n\n7. After 28 rounds of perfect pattern adherence despite continuous losses, there is practically no reason to believe they will suddenly change.\n\n8. The expected value of playing scissors is overwhelmingly positive given their demonstrated behavior.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"
