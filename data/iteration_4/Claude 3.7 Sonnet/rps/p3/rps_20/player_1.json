    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without prior information, I need to consider the payoff structure:\n   - rock beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n   - paper beats rock (+3/-3 points)\n   - scissors beats paper (+1/-1 points)\n3. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3), while rock and scissors only offer +1.\n4. However, paper also has the highest risk if the opponent plays scissors.\n5. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, they might choose randomly or go with the common first-move choice of rock.\n6. The expected value calculation favors paper since its win is worth more points.\n7. Given that many players tend to choose rock in the first round (a common psychological pattern), paper seems optimal.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it counters the common first-move rock and offers the highest potential reward.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I need to consider how my opponent might adjust their strategy:\n   - They lost with rock, so they might avoid it this time\n   - A common pattern is for players to switch to the move that would have beaten their previous choice\n   - This would mean they might play scissors this round (to counter my previous paper)\n3.

Let's consider the psychology: after losing by a significant margin (-3 points), players often make a reactive change\n6. The payoff structure still shows paper has the highest reward potential (+3), but scissors is safer against a paper response\n7. Given that my opponent just lost to paper, scissors seems less likely for them to play next\n8. Rock provides protection against their potential scissors play and only risks a -3 against paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round, anticipating they might switch to scissors to counter my previous paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"
