After playing scissors three consecutive times:\n   - They might continue with scissors if they think I won't expect a fourth scissors\n   - They might switch to rock anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors streak\n   - They might switch to paper if they think I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors\n\n6. The fact that they've stuck with scissors for three rounds suggests they might be trying to establish a pattern to trick me.\n\n7. Given their strong commitment to scissors, they're most likely to either continue with scissors or switch to rock (expecting me to play scissors).\n\n8. Playing rock would be safe against their potential scissors (win) and would tie against their potential rock.\n\n9. While they might anticipate this and play paper, the probability seems lower given their recent heavy scissors play.\n\n10. I need to break my pattern of losses and recover points.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Rock. My opponent has played scissors three times in a row, which is a strong pattern. Rock is the logical counter to scissors and would give me a win if they continue this pattern. Even if they switch to rock anticipating my move, it would result in a tie rather than a loss. This move aims to capitalize on their established pattern while minimizing risk.\n"

The fact that they've stuck with scissors for four consecutive rounds despite losing the last round is unusual and suggests either:\n   - They have a predetermined pattern they're following regardless of outcomes\n   - They're trying to condition me to play rock consistently so they can counter with paper\n   - They're not adapting their strategy effectively\n\n7.

My current score remains at -4 points (0 + 0 - 3 + 1 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 + 1 - 3 + 0 = -4).\n\n4. We've now had 7 ties out of 17 rounds (about 41%), which is still quite high.\n\n5. They've broken their paper streak and switched to scissors, resulting in a tie.\n\n6. Their recent pattern has been: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n7. Overall, they seem to switch between sticking with a move for multiple rounds and then changing.\n\n8. After our scissors tie:\n   - They might switch to rock, expecting me to play scissors again\n   - They might continue with scissors if they think I'll switch to paper\n   - They might play paper if they think I'll play rock expecting their rock\n\n9. Given their history of repeating moves and the recent tie with scissors, there's a decent chance they might play scissors again or switch to rock.\n\n10. Playing rock would be effective against their potential scissors and would tie with their potential rock.\n\n11. This would also be a safer play than paper (which would lose to scissors and only win against rock).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Rock. After our scissors tie, my opponent is likely to either continue with scissors (following their pattern of sticking with moves) or switch to rock (expecting me to play scissors again). Rock would win against scissors and tie with rock, making it the most balanced choice. While they might play paper, their history suggests they're more likely to either repeat scissors or counter my expected scissors with rock. This move offers the best combination of offensive potential and defensive safety.\n"

I've won with rock against their scissors multiple times (5 wins), yet they continue to occasionally play scissors.\n\n6. Their overall pattern shows:\n   - Long stretches of the same move (especially their 7-scissors streak)\n   - Occasional shifts between moves\n   - Recently alternating between paper and scissors\n\n7. After I just won with rock against their scissors:\n   - They might switch to paper to counter my successful rock play\n   - They might play rock, expecting me to play paper to counter their expected paper\n   - They might continue with scissors for a third time (less likely given my success with rock)\n\n8. Given that I've won multiple times with rock against their scissors, they have a strong incentive to play paper.\n\n9. If I expect them to play paper, I should play scissors.\n\n10.

After our scissors tie and considering my opponent's recent pattern of playing scissors twice in a row, there's a reasonable chance they'll continue with scissors for a third time (as they did with their earlier long scissors streak). Rock has been my most successful move in this game, winning 6 times against their scissors. While they might anticipate this and play paper, their demonstrated tendency to repeat moves for multiple rounds makes rock a calculated risk worth taking. This move balances the probability of their continued scissors play against the possibility they'll switch to paper.\n"

My current score is -3 points (0 + 0 - 3 + 1 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 + 1 - 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 3 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 1 - 1 - 1 = -3).\n\n4. I've now lost two consecutive rounds, first with scissors against rock (-1) and then with paper against scissors (-1).\n\n5. Their recent pattern has been: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n6. They've returned to scissors after playing rock, which suggests they might be alternating between these two moves.\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern, they have played scissors more than any other move (15 scissors, 7 paper, 6 rock).\n\n8. After beating my paper with scissors:\n   - They might continue with scissors if they think I'll play paper again\n   - They might switch to rock, expecting me to play scissors to counter their scissors\n   - They might play paper if they think I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors\n\n9. Given their high frequency of scissors play and their recent success with it, there's a good chance they might play scissors again.\n\n10. If I expect them to play scissors, I should play rock.\n\n11. Rock has been my most successful move against them, winning 7 times against their scissors.\n\n12. Playing rock would be a safe choice with good winning potential against their potential scissors play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Rock. After losing to my opponent's scissors with paper, I expect them to either continue with scissors (given their high frequency of scissors play throughout the game) or switch to rock (expecting me to counter with scissors). Rock would win against their potential scissors play and tie with their potential rock play. Given that rock has been my most successful move in this game (winning 7 times against their scissors), and that scissors has been their most frequent move overall (15 out of 28 rounds), rock offers the best combination of offensive potential and defensive safety to break my losing streak.\n"

My current score is -2 points (0 + 0 - 3 + 1 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 + 1 - 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 3 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 = -2).\n\n4. I've now won with rock against their scissors 8 times in this game.\n\n5. Their recent pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n6. They've now played scissors 16 times out of 29 rounds (55% of the time), making it their most frequent choice by far.\n\n7. After I just won with rock against their scissors:\n   - They might finally switch to paper to counter my successful rock play\n   - They might play rock, expecting me to play paper to counter their expected paper\n   - They might continue with scissors if they're following a predetermined pattern\n\n8. Given that I've won with rock against their scissors multiple times now (8 times), they have a strong incentive to switch to paper.\n\n9. However, they've continued to play scissors despite my repeated success with rock, which suggests either:\n   - They're following a predetermined pattern regardless of outcomes\n   - They're attempting to condition me to expect scissors and then surprise me\n   - They're not adapting their strategy effectively\n\n10. Given their unusual persistence with scissors despite my rock success, I need to carefully consider whether they'll finally adapt.\n\n11. The most logical move for them would be to switch to paper, but their history suggests they might continue with scissors.\n\n12. If I expect them to finally switch to paper, I should play scissors.\n    If I expect them to continue with scissors, I should play rock.\n\n13. Given the overwhelming evidence that they should switch to paper after my repeated rock success, but balanced against their demonstrated tendency to stick with scissors, a balanced approach would be to play scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Scissors. After winning with rock against my opponent's scissors for the eighth time in this game, I believe they're finally likely to switch to paper to counter my anticipated rock play. While they've shown an unusual persistence with scissors throughout the game, the rational response after losing to rock so many times would be to play paper. By playing scissors, I aim to anticipate this overdue adaptation. This is a calculated risk based on game theory and the increasing pressure on them to change their strategy after repeated losses to rock.\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
