The opponent's pattern has changed. Previously they seemed to alternate between paper and rock, but now they've played scissors.\n\n3. This suggests they may have adapted their strategy, perhaps realizing I was catching on to their pattern.\n\n4. The opponent has now played each possible move at least once: paper (2x), rock (2x), and scissors (1x).\n\n5. After playing scissors, what might they play next?\n   - They might go back to their alternating pattern, which would mean paper next\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll play\n   - They might play rock again, as it worked well against me previously\n\n6.

The opponent's complete pattern has been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. We've had 5 ties and I've lost twice.

One possibility is that the opponent is using a strategy where they play what I played in the previous round. Let's check:\n   - Round 2: I played paper in Round 1, they played rock (doesn't match)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors in Round 2, they played paper (doesn't match)\n   - Round 4: I played paper in Round 3, they played rock (doesn't match)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors in Round 4, they played scissors (matches!)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors in Round 5, they played paper (doesn't match)\n   - Round 7: I played paper in Round 6, they played rock (doesn't match)\n\n6. Their strategy doesn't seem to be simply copying my previous move.\n\n7. After they play rock (as in the last round), they have played paper twice (rounds 2\u21923 and 4\u21925).\n\n8.

Even though it's risky, scissors gives me the best chance to win.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, predicting they'll play paper based on their historical pattern after playing rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The opponent's pattern has been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. We've now had 6 ties and I've lost twice. I still haven't won any rounds.\n\n4. The opponent continues to match my moves with surprising frequency (6 ties out of 8 rounds).\n\n5. After they play scissors (as in the last round), they have previously played paper (round 5\u21926).\n\n6. If they continue this pattern, they would play paper next.\n\n7. However, the more significant pattern seems to be that they're matching my moves exactly in many rounds. This suggests they might be:\n   - Somehow predicting my moves\n   - Using a strategy that coincidentally aligns with mine\n   - Actually copying my moves (though this would be impossible in simultaneous play)\n\n8. Given this unusual pattern of ties, I need to consider if the opponent has some way of knowing or predicting my choices.\n\n9. If they're going to match my move again, any choice would result in a tie.\n\n10. If they're following their sequence pattern, after scissors they should play paper.\n\n11.

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n\n2. The opponent's pattern has been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. We've now had 7 ties and I've lost twice. I still haven't won any rounds.\n\n4. The most striking pattern is that the opponent has matched my move in 7 out of 9 rounds, which is statistically unlikely by chance.\n\n5. The only times they didn't match me were in rounds 2 and 4, when they played rock to counter my scissors.\n\n6. This suggests one of two possibilities:\n   - The opponent has an extraordinary ability to predict my moves\n   - The opponent is somehow seeing my moves before making theirs (which shouldn't be possible in proper simultaneous play)\n\n7. Given this unusual pattern, I need to try something different to break the cycle.\n\n8. Let's examine what happens after they play rock (as in the last round):\n   - After round 2 (rock), they played paper in round 3\n   - After round 4 (rock), they played scissors in round 5\n   - After round 7 (rock), they played scissors in round 8\n   - So after rock, they've played paper once and scissors twice\n\n9. Based on their sequence pattern, scissors seems more likely after rock.\n\n10. However, given the strong pattern of matches, they may simply match whatever I play again.\n\n11. Since they've matched me so consistently, and the only times they didn't match were when I played scissors (they countered with rock), I need to try a move that would win if they match me again.\n\n12. No move can beat itself, so a tie is inevitable if they match me again.\n\n13. Given that I need to win a round, and paper has the highest potential reward (+3 against rock), I'll choose paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, which would give me the best outcome (+3) if they break their matching pattern and play rock again as they did in rounds 2 and 4.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The opponent has matched my move in 8 out of 10 rounds, which is extremely improbable by random chance.\n\n3. The only exceptions were rounds 2 and 4, when I played scissors and they played rock.\n\n4. This suggests an almost certain pattern: they either know my move in advance or are using a strategy that happens to align with mine with extraordinary accuracy.\n\n5. Given this extraordinary matching pattern, I need to consider a different approach.\n\n6. If they are somehow seeing my moves before making theirs (which shouldn't be possible in proper simultaneous play), then I cannot win by conventional strategy.\n\n7. If they are using a predictive algorithm based on my past moves, I need to be unpredictable.\n\n8. Looking specifically at my scissors plays:\n   - Round 2: scissors \u2192 they played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 4: scissors \u2192 they played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 5: scissors \u2192 they played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 8: scissors \u2192 they played scissors (tie)\n\n9. The pattern with scissors seems to have shifted from them countering with rock to matching me.\n\n10. Since I need to win at least one round, and given the high probability they'll match my move again, I should try the move I've used least often.\n\n11. I've played paper 4 times, scissors 4 times, and rock 2 times.\n\n12. Rock is my least frequently used move. If they're using a frequency-based prediction, this might be my best chance to break the pattern.\n\n13. However, if they continue matching me, any move will result in a tie.\n\n14. Since I've never won and scissors has lost twice, I'll try scissors again as it's the only move that has ever produced a non-tie result.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, hoping to break this extraordinary matching pattern and potentially win if they play paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The opponent has now matched my move in 9 out of 11 rounds, which is virtually impossible by random chance.\n\n3. The only exceptions were rounds 2 and 4, both early in the game, when I played scissors and they played rock.\n\n4. Since round 5, they have matched my move 7 consecutive times, regardless of what I play.\n\n5. This suggests one of two scenarios:\n   - The opponent has access to my moves before making theirs\n   - The game system itself is designed to create matches (like playing against a mirror)\n\n6. Given this extraordinary matching pattern that has now continued for 7 straight rounds, conventional game theory no longer applies.\n\n7. If they are going to match my move again, any move will result in another tie.\n\n8. However, in the early rounds, they specifically countered scissors with rock twice.\n\n9.

This is a significant development! The opponent finally broke their pattern of matching my moves, and I won the round.\n\n3. After 7 consecutive rounds of matching my moves, they played rock when I played paper.\n\n4. This could indicate:\n   - They've changed their strategy\n   - They anticipated I would play scissors again (as I did in round 11)\n   - They're trying to be unpredictable after I identified their matching pattern\n\n5. Let's analyze what happened after my previous wins and losses:\n   - This was my first win, so no pattern yet\n   - After my losses in rounds 2 and 4 (both when I played scissors and they played rock), I played paper and scissors respectively\n\n6. Now that they've broken their matching pattern, they might:\n   - Return to matching (though this seems less likely now)\n   - Try to counter what they think I'll play next\n   - Play randomly to be unpredictable\n\n7.

Since they just played rock and lost, they're unlikely to play rock again immediately.\n\n11.

The game has dramatically changed! I've now won two consecutive rounds after a long series of ties.\n\n3. The opponent has completely broken their matching pattern and seems to be playing a more conventional strategy now.\n\n4. Their recent moves show a pattern:\n   - Round 12: They played rock\n   - Round 13: They played scissors\n\n5.

The opponent's recent moves show an interesting pattern:\n   - Round 12: They played rock\n   - Round 13: They played scissors\n   - Round 14: They played rock again\n\n3. This suggests they might be oscillating between rock and scissors rather than following a traditional rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n\n4.

Since the opponent has shown a tendency to counter scissors with rock, they might anticipate I'll avoid scissors after losing with it.\n\n11. If they think I'll play paper or rock next, they might choose scissors or paper respectively.\n\n12. Given their recent behavior and apparent preferences, rock seems to be the safest choice with positive expected value.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, anticipating they might play scissors next based on their recent oscillating pattern, or at least won't play paper which they've used least frequently.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After they play paper (as in round 16), what do they typically play next?\n   - After round 1 (paper), they played rock in round 2\n   - After round 3 (paper), they played rock in round 4\n   - After round 6 (paper), they played rock in round 7\n   - After round 10 (paper), they played scissors in round 11\n   - So after paper, they've played rock 3 times and scissors once\n\n6. Based on this pattern, rock seems more likely after they play paper.\n\n7. However, given that they just broke their recent alternating pattern, they might be trying to be unpredictable.\n\n8. If they play rock as their historical pattern after paper suggests, my best move would be paper.\n\n9. If they play scissors (continuing what would have been their alternating pattern if they hadn't played paper), my best move would be rock.\n\n10. If they play paper again, any move would result in a tie.\n\n11. The safest play with positive expected value would be rock, which:\n    - Beats scissors (+1) if they return to their alternating pattern\n    - Ties with rock (0) if they play rock\n    - Loses to paper (-3) if they repeat paper\n\n12. Given the uncertainty after they broke their pattern, and that scissors appears slightly more frequently in their overall history, rock seems like the safest choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, which would beat scissors if they return to their alternating pattern, and has a safer risk profile than paper in this uncertain situation.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let's review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n\n2. The opponent has returned to matching my moves in the last two rounds, after a brief period of following a different pattern.\n\n3. Looking at their moves after playing rock (as in round 17):\n   - After round 2 (rock), they played paper in round 3\n   - After round 4 (rock), they played scissors in round 5\n   - After round 7 (rock), they played scissors in round 8\n   - After round 9 (rock), they played paper in round 10\n   - After round 12 (rock), they played scissors in round 13\n   - After round 14 (rock), they played scissors in round 15\n   - So after rock, they've played paper 2 times and scissors 4 times\n\n4. Based on this historical pattern, scissors seems more likely after they play rock.\n\n5. However, they've also returned to matching my moves in rounds 16 and 17, similar to their strategy in the early part of the game.\n\n6. If they continue matching me, any move will result in a tie.\n\n7. If they follow their historical pattern after rock, scissors is more likely, in which case rock would be my best counter.\n\n8. If they play paper (which they've done twice after rock), scissors would be my best counter.\n\n9. Given that scissors is their more frequent play after rock, and that they've recently matched my moves twice in a row, I need to balance these two possibilities.\n\n10. Rock would:\n    - Beat scissors (+1) if they follow their most common pattern after rock\n    - Tie with rock (0) if they match me again\n    - Lose to paper (-3) if they follow their less common pattern after rock\n\n11. Paper would:\n    - Beat rock (+3) if they match me or play rock\n    - Tie with paper (0) if they play paper\n    - Lose to scissors (-1) if they follow their most common pattern after rock\n\n12. Given their recent return to matching and the historical likelihood of scissors after rock, the expected value of playing paper seems higher if I factor in both possibilities.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, which would win against rock (+3) if they match me or play rock independently, and has a better expected value considering all likely scenarios.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The opponent has now matched my move in 3 consecutive rounds (16, 17, 18), suggesting they may have returned to their earlier matching strategy.\n\n3. In total, they've matched my move in 12 out of 18 rounds, which is far more than would occur by random chance.\n\n4. Looking at their moves after playing paper (as in round 18):\n   - After round 1 (paper), they played rock in round 2\n   - After round 3 (paper), they played rock in round 4\n   - After round 6 (paper), they played rock in round 7\n   - After round 10 (paper), they played scissors in round 11\n   - After round 16 (paper), they played rock in round 17\n   - So after paper, they've played rock 4 times and scissors once\n\n5. Based on this historical pattern, rock seems much more likely after they play paper.\n\n6. However, if they're back to their matching strategy, they'll simply play whatever I play.\n\n7. During the brief period when they weren't matching (rounds 12-15), I won 3 out of 4 rounds.\n\n8. If they're matching me, any move will result in a tie.\n\n9. If they follow their historical pattern after paper, rock is more likely, in which case paper would be my best counter.\n\n10. If I want to test whether they're truly back to matching, I should play a move I haven't used recently (scissors).\n\n11. Scissors would:\n    - Beat paper (+1) if they play paper\n    - Tie with scissors (0) if they match me\n    - Lose to rock (-1) if they follow their historical pattern after paper\n\n12. Given their strong tendency to play rock after paper historically, but their recent return to matching, this is a good opportunity to test their strategy with scissors.\n\n13. If they match my scissors, I'll know they're definitely back to the matching strategy. If they play rock, I'll know they're following their historical pattern instead.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors as a strategic test. If they match me, it confirms they're back to matching. If they play rock (their historical pattern after paper), I'll only lose 1 point but gain valuable information about their strategy.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The opponent has now matched my move in 4 consecutive rounds (16-19), strongly confirming they've returned to their matching strategy.\n\n3. In total, they've matched my move in 13 out of 19 rounds (68%), which is statistically significant.\n\n4. The test in round 19 confirms they're back to matching my moves.\n\n5. If they're truly matching my moves, they will play whatever I play in this round.\n\n6. This means any move I make will result in a tie if they continue this strategy.\n\n7. However, there were brief periods when they broke this pattern (particularly rounds 12-15).\n\n8. During that non-matching period, I won when I played paper against rock (+3) and rock against scissors (+1 twice).\n\n9. If there's any chance they'll break their matching pattern again, paper has the highest potential reward (+3 against rock).\n\n10. Looking at the times they didn't match my moves:\n    - Round 2: I played scissors, they played rock\n    - Round 4: I played scissors, they played rock\n    - Round 12: I played paper, they played rock\n    - Round 13: I played rock, they played scissors\n    - Round 14: I played scissors, they played rock\n    - Round 15: I played rock, they played scissors\n\n11. When they didn't match, they played rock 3 times and scissors 2 times (never paper).\n\n12. If they break their matching pattern, rock or scissors seems more likely than paper.\n\n13. Given this analysis, and that paper has the highest potential reward if they play rock, paper seems like the optimal choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, which will likely result in a tie if they match me (as their recent pattern suggests), but has the highest potential reward (+3) if they break their matching pattern and play rock (which they've done several times when not matching).\n\n[move] paper\n"

This is a significant development! The opponent has broken their matching pattern again and played rock against my paper, which gave me a win (+3 points).\n\n3. Looking at the pattern of when they've broken their matching strategy:\n   - Rounds 1-11: Mostly matching (9/11 rounds)\n   - Rounds 12-15: No matching (0/4 rounds)\n   - Rounds 16-19: All matching (4/4 rounds)\n   - Round 20: No matching (played rock against my paper)\n\n4. This suggests they might be switching between strategies.\n\n5. After I win with paper against rock (as in rounds 12 and 20), what happened next?\n   - After round 12 (won with paper), I played rock and won against their scissors in round 13\n   - No data yet after round 20\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after they play rock (as in round 20):\n   - After round 2 (rock), they played paper in round 3\n   - After round 4 (rock), they played scissors in round 5\n   - After round 7 (rock), they played scissors in round 8\n   - After round 9 (rock), they played paper in round 10\n   - After round 12 (rock), they played scissors in round 13\n   - After round 14 (rock), they played scissors in round 15\n   - After round 17 (rock), they played paper in round 18\n   - So after rock, they've played paper 3 times and scissors 4 times\n\n7. Based on historical patterns, scissors is slightly more likely after they play rock.\n\n8. If they play scissors next, my best counter would be rock.\n\n9. If they return to their matching strategy, they'll play whatever I play.\n\n10.

The opponent is showing a very clear pattern in their recent moves:\n   - Round 20: They played rock\n   - Round 21: They played scissors\n   - Round 22: They played rock\n\n3. They appear to be alternating between rock and scissors, without using paper at all.\n\n4. If this alternating pattern continues, they would play scissors next.\n\n5. Looking at their moves after playing rock (as in round 22):\n   - After round 2 (rock), they played paper in round 3\n   - After round 4 (rock), they played scissors in round 5\n   - After round 7 (rock), they played scissors in round 8\n   - After round 9 (rock), they played paper in round 10\n   - After round 12 (rock), they played scissors in round 13\n   - After round 14 (rock), they played scissors in round 15\n   - After round 17 (rock), they played paper in round 18\n   - After round 20 (rock), they played scissors in round 21\n   - So after rock, they've played paper 3 times and scissors 5 times\n\n6.

Rock would:\n   - Beat scissors (+1) if they follow their pattern as expected\n   - Tie with rock (0) if they break their pattern and repeat rock\n   - Lose to paper (-3) if they surprise with paper (which they haven't played recently)\n\n9. The opponent hasn't played paper in the last 6 rounds, making it less likely they'll suddenly play paper now.\n\n10. Given their strong recent pattern and historical tendencies, rock is clearly the optimal choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, anticipating they'll play scissors next based on their clear alternating pattern between rock and scissors and their historical tendency to play scissors after rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let's review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n\n2. This is a significant change! The opponent broke their recent rock-scissors alternating pattern and played paper instead of the expected scissors.\n\n3. Their recent moves now show:\n   - Round 20: They played rock\n   - Round 21: They played scissors\n   - Round 22: They played rock\n   - Round 23: They played paper\n\n4. This suggests they might have recognized that I detected their pattern and adapted accordingly.\n\n5. Looking at their moves after playing paper (as in round 23):\n   - After round 1 (paper), they played rock in round 2\n   - After round 3 (paper), they played rock in round 4\n   - After round 6 (paper), they played rock in round 7\n   - After round 10 (paper), they played scissors in round 11\n   - After round 16 (paper), they played rock in round 17\n   - After round 18 (paper), they played scissors in round 19\n   - So after paper, they've played rock 4 times and scissors 2 times\n\n6. Based on historical patterns, rock is more likely after they play paper.\n\n7. However, they just demonstrated they can break patterns when I start to exploit them.\n\n8. If they play rock as their historical pattern after paper suggests, my best move would be paper.\n\n9. If they anticipate I'll predict rock and play paper, they might play scissors to counter.\n\n10. If they're trying to be unpredictable after I won 4 consecutive rounds, they might play scissors to break their historical pattern after paper.\n\n11. Paper would:\n    - Beat rock (+3) if they follow their historical pattern after paper\n    - Tie with paper (0) if they repeat paper\n    - Lose to scissors (-1) if they try to counter my expected paper play\n\n12. Rock would:\n    - Beat scissors (+1) if they try to counter my expected paper play\n    - Tie with rock (0) if they follow their historical pattern after paper\n    - Lose to paper (-3) if they repeat paper\n\n13. Given that they just surprised me with paper (which they hadn't played in 6 rounds), and that they might be trying to counter my strategy, rock seems safer than paper in this uncertain situation.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, anticipating they might try to counter my expected paper play with scissors, rather than following their historical pattern of playing rock after paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I won again! Looking at the opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 21: They played scissors\n   - Round 22: They played rock\n   - Round 23: They played paper\n   - Round 24: They played scissors\n\n3. Their last three moves show a rock-paper-scissors sequence, which could be intentional.\n\n4. If they're following a deliberate rock-paper-scissors cycle, they would play rock next.\n\n5. Looking at their moves after playing scissors (as in round 24):\n   - After round 5 (scissors), they played paper in round 6\n   - After round 8 (scissors), they played rock in round 9\n   - After round 11 (scissors), they played rock in round 12\n   - After round 13 (scissors), they played rock in round 14\n   - After round 15 (scissors), they played paper in round 16\n   - After round 19 (scissors), they played rock in round 20\n   - After round 21 (scissors), they played rock in round 22\n   - So after scissors, they've played paper 2 times and rock 5 times\n\n6. Based on historical patterns, rock is much more likely after they play scissors.\n\n7. If they play rock as predicted (either from their recent cycle or their historical pattern), my best move would be paper.\n\n8. Paper would:\n   - Beat rock (+3) if they follow their pattern as expected\n   - Tie with paper (0) if they repeat their round 23 move\n   - Lose to scissors (-1) if they repeat their round 24 move\n\n9. Given their strong historical tendency to play rock after scissors (5/7 times), and the possibility they're following a rock-paper-scissors cycle, paper seems optimal.\n\n10. However, they've shown they can be unpredictable (like in round 23 when they played paper instead of the expected scissors).\n\n11. Still, the evidence for rock as their next move is strong from both their possible cycle and their historical tendencies.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, anticipating they'll play rock next based on both their potential rock-paper-scissors cycle and their strong historical tendency to play rock after scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Their rock-paper-scissors sequence was broken with paper again, so they're not following that simple cycle.\n\n5. Let's look at their moves after playing paper (as in round 25):\n   - After round 1 (paper), they played rock in round 2\n   - After round 3 (paper), they played rock in round 4\n   - After round 6 (paper), they played rock in round 7\n   - After round 10 (paper), they played scissors in round 11\n   - After round 16 (paper), they played rock in round 17\n   - After round 18 (paper), they played scissors in round 19\n   - After round 23 (paper), they played scissors in round 24\n   - So after paper, they've played rock 4 times and scissors 3 times\n\n6. Based on historical patterns, rock is slightly more likely after they play paper, but scissors is also common.\n\n7. The opponent may also be returning to their matching strategy (as they did in rounds 16-19), as evidenced by the tie in round 25.\n\n8. If they're matching me again, any move will result in a tie.\n\n9. If they follow their historical pattern after paper, rock is slightly more likely, in which case paper would be my best counter.\n\n10. If they play scissors (also common after paper), rock would be my best counter.\n\n11. Rock would:\n    - Beat scissors (+1) if they play scissors (common after paper)\n    - Tie with rock (0) if they play rock or match my move\n    - Lose to paper (-3) if they play paper again\n\n12. Paper would:\n    - Beat rock (+3) if they play rock (most common after paper)\n    - Tie with paper (0) if they play paper again or match my move\n    - Lose to scissors (-1) if they play scissors\n\n13. Given the uncertainty about whether they've returned to matching or are following their historical patterns, rock seems slightly safer than paper in this situation, especially considering scissors has been played after paper in 3 of the last 4 instances.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, which would beat scissors if they follow their recent tendency after paper, and has a better risk profile than paper in this uncertain situation.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The opponent has played paper twice in a row now (rounds 25 and 26), which is unusual in their pattern.\n\n3. Looking at their recent moves:\n   - Round 23: They played paper\n   - Round 24: They played scissors\n   - Round 25: They played paper\n   - Round 26: They played paper\n\n4. This suggests they might be adapting their strategy to counter my moves.\n\n5. Looking at their moves after playing paper (as in round 26):\n   - After round 1 (paper), they played rock in round 2\n   - After round 3 (paper), they played rock in round 4\n   - After round 6 (paper), they played rock in round 7\n   - After round 10 (paper), they played scissors in round 11\n   - After round 16 (paper), they played rock in round 17\n   - After round 18 (paper), they played scissors in round 19\n   - After round 23 (paper), they played scissors in round 24\n   - After round 25 (paper), they played paper in round 26\n   - So after paper, they've played rock 4 times, scissors 3 times, and paper once\n\n6. Based on historical patterns, rock or scissors is more likely after they play paper, but they've just broken this pattern by playing paper twice in a row.\n\n7. If they play rock (historically common after paper), my best counter would be paper.\n   If they play scissors (also common after paper), my best counter would be rock.\n   If they play paper again (breaking their historical pattern), my best counter would be scissors.\n\n8. Given that they've played paper twice in a row (breaking their usual pattern), they might be more likely to play paper again or switch to a different move.\n\n9. Scissors would:\n   - Beat paper (+1) if they play paper again\n   - Tie with scissors (0) if they play scissors\n   - Lose to rock (-1) if they revert to their historical pattern after paper\n\n10. The risk with scissors is relatively low (-1 if wrong) while the potential reward (+1 if right) matches that risk.\n\n11. Given their unusual consecutive paper plays and the favorable risk-reward ratio of scissors in this situation, scissors seems like the optimal choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, anticipating they might play paper again (continuing their break from historical patterns) or at least not play rock (which would be their most common historical play after paper).\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let's review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 24: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 25: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 26: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 27: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 28: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n\n2. The opponent has matched my move for 3 consecutive rounds now (rounds 26-28), suggesting they've returned to their matching strategy.\n\n3. In total, they've matched my move in 16 out of 28 rounds (57%), which is statistically significant.\n\n4. Looking at their moves after playing paper (as in round 28):\n   - After round 1 (paper), they played rock in round 2\n   - After round 3 (paper), they played rock in round 4\n   - After round 6 (paper), they played rock in round 7\n   - After round 10 (paper), they played scissors in round 11\n   - After round 16 (paper), they played rock in round 17\n   - After round 18 (paper), they played scissors in round 19\n   - After round 23 (paper), they played scissors in round 24\n   - After round 25 (paper), they played paper in round 26\n   - After round 26 (paper), they played scissors in round 27\n   - So after paper, they've played rock 4 times, scissors 4 times, and paper once\n\n5. Based on historical patterns, rock or scissors is equally likely after they play paper.\n\n6. However, given their recent return to matching my moves (3 consecutive matches), they'll likely play whatever I play in this round.\n\n7. If they're matching me, any move will result in a tie.\n\n8. In the rare instances when they've broken their matching pattern recently (like rounds 23 and 26), they've played paper when I played rock.\n\n9. If they follow their historical pattern after paper, rock or scissors is equally likely.\n\n10. Rock would:\n    - Beat scissors (+1) if they play scissors (common after paper)\n    - Tie with rock (0) if they match me\n    - Lose to paper (-3) if they play paper (which they've done when breaking patterns)\n\n11. Scissors would:\n    - Beat paper (+1) if they play paper (which they've done when breaking patterns)\n    - Tie with scissors (0) if they match me\n    - Lose to rock (-1) if they play rock (common after paper)\n\n12. Given their recent matching behavior and the fact that when they've broken patterns recently they've played paper, scissors seems like the slightly better choice with a better risk-reward ratio (-1/+1 vs -3/+1 for rock).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, which would beat paper if they break their matching pattern as they've done recently, and has a better risk profile than rock in this situation.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I won in round 29! The opponent broke their matching pattern and played paper when I played scissors.\n\n3. Looking at their recent moves:\n   - Round 26: They played paper\n   - Round 27: They played scissors\n   - Round 28: They played paper\n   - Round 29: They played paper\n\n4. They've now played paper in 3 of the last 4 rounds, which is unusual compared to their overall pattern.\n\n5. Looking at their moves after playing paper (as in round 29):\n   - After round 1 (paper), they played rock in round 2\n   - After round 3 (paper), they played rock in round 4\n   - After round 6 (paper), they played rock in round 7\n   - After round 10 (paper), they played scissors in round 11\n   - After round 16 (paper), they played rock in round 17\n   - After round 18 (paper), they played scissors in round 19\n   - After round 23 (paper), they played scissors in round 24\n   - After round 25 (paper), they played paper in round 26\n   - After round 26 (paper), they played scissors in round 27\n   - After round 28 (paper), they played paper in round 29\n   - So after paper, they've played rock 4 times, scissors 4 times, and paper twice\n\n6. Based on historical patterns, rock or scissors is equally likely after they play paper, with paper being less common.\n\n7. However, they've played paper twice in a row now (rounds 28-29), which might indicate a shift in their strategy.\n\n8. If they continue their recent paper-heavy strategy, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n9. If they revert to their historical pattern after paper (rock or scissors), rock would be the safer play.\n\n10. Rock would:\n    - Beat scissors (+1) if they play scissors (common after paper historically)\n    - Tie with rock (0) if they play rock (common after paper historically)\n    - Lose to paper (-3) if they continue their recent paper trend\n\n11. Scissors would:\n    - Beat paper (+1) if they continue their recent paper trend\n    - Tie with scissors (0) if they play scissors (common after paper historically)\n    - Lose to rock (-1) if they play rock (common after paper historically)\n\n12. Given their recent unusual paper-heavy strategy and the better risk-reward ratio of scissors (-1/+1 vs -3/+1 for rock), scissors seems like the better choice again.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors again, anticipating they might continue their recent paper-heavy strategy, and accepting the smaller risk if they revert to their historical pattern of playing rock after paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
