I won.\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock.

I lost.\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie.\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie.\n\n2. We've now had three consecutive ties with different patterns: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock.\n\n3. My opponent's full sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock.\n\n4. The three consecutive ties suggest my opponent might be deliberately matching my moves or using a sophisticated prediction strategy.\n\n5. After multiple ties, there's often a strong psychological impulse to break the pattern with a different move.\n\n6. Looking at the sequence of ties:\n   - After rock-rock tie, we both played scissors.\n   - After scissors-scissors tie, we both played rock.\n   - This suggests a potential pattern of switching after ties.\n\n7. Given that we just tied with rock, there's a high probability we'll both try to switch to a different move.\n\n8. The most direct switch from rock would be to paper (which beats rock).\n\n9. However, if my opponent anticipates I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors.\n\n10. Considering this recursive reasoning and the pattern of multiple ties, I need to break this cycle.\n\n11. Since we've just had a rock-rock tie and previously had a scissors-scissors tie, paper is the only move we haven't tied with recently.\n\n12. If my opponent follows the pattern of switching after ties, they might choose paper. If they anticipate I'll choose paper, they might choose scissors.\n\n13. Given these considerations and the need to break the tie streak, scissors seems like the optimal move - it would beat paper if they switch to that, and it disrupts the recent pattern of ties.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

I just broke the tie streak by winning with scissors against their paper.\n\n3. My opponent's full sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper.\n\n4. Interestingly, their last three moves have been: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, which is a complete cycle through all three options.\n\n5. Looking at their behavior after losses:\n   - When I won with paper in Round 1, they played scissors next.\n   - When I won with rock in Round 2, they stayed with scissors.\n   - When I won with paper in Round 4, they switched to paper.\n   - Now that I've won with scissors, they might switch again.\n\n6. A common reaction after losing is to switch to what would have beaten the opponent's move. Since I played scissors, they might play rock next.\n\n7. Another common strategy is to play what would have beaten their own previous move. Since they played paper, they might play scissors next.\n\n8. Given their recent pattern of cycling through moves (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), the next move in their sequence would logically be scissors.\n\n9. If they play scissors next, rock would be my optimal counter.\n\n10. Considering their historical reactions to losses and the apparent cycle they've been following, rock seems like the strongest move - it would beat their scissors if they follow the cycle or if they switch to what would beat my previous move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Looking at the pattern after our previous rock-rock ties:\n   - After the first rock-rock tie (Round 9), we both played scissors.\n   - After the second rock-rock tie (Round 11), I played scissors and they played paper.\n   - This suggests a tendency to move away from rock after rock-rock ties.\n\n5. My opponent seems to have a slight preference for rock (6 times) over scissors (4 times) and paper (3 times).\n\n6.

Looking at their overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 8 times (57%)\n   - Paper: 3 times (21%)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (21%)\n   This shows a strong preference for rock.\n\n6. Their behavior after winning with rock:\n   - In Round 1, they lost with rock and played scissors next.\n   - In Round 6, they won with rock and played scissors next.\n   - This suggests they might switch to scissors after winning with rock.\n\n7. However, they've just played rock twice in a row, which might indicate they're settling into a pattern or have recognized my moves are predictable.\n\n8. Given their strong preference for rock and their recent double rock play, there's a significant chance they'll play rock again.\n\n9. Alternatively, they might anticipate that I'll play paper to counter their rock, and thus switch to scissors.\n\n10. Considering their historical preference for rock and the recent consecutive rock plays, paper seems like the optimal move - it would beat rock if they play it a third time, and even if they switch, it disrupts the current dynamic.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Their extremely strong preference for rock (11 out of 18 moves) suggests they might play rock again.\n\n8. After multiple consecutive rock plays and ties, there's psychological pressure to switch to break the pattern.\n\n9. Given their historical behavior:\n   - They might stick with rock due to their strong preference\n   - They might switch to paper anticipating I'll play rock again\n   - They might switch to scissors anticipating I'll switch to paper\n\n10. Considering their overwhelming preference for rock and the recent sequence of rock plays, paper seems like the optimal move - it would beat rock if they play it again (which they do most often), and it's the logical counter to their most frequent choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I just won with paper against their rock for the second consecutive time after a rock-rock tie.\n\n3. My opponent's full sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock.\n\n4. Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - Round 16: rock\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: rock\n   This shows they've played rock in four consecutive rounds.\n\n5. Their overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 12 times (63%)\n   - Paper: 3 times (16%)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (21%)\n   Their preference for rock has become extremely pronounced.\n\n6. After losing with rock:\n   - After losing with rock in Round 1, they played scissors.\n   - After losing with rock in Round 4, they played paper.\n   - After losing with rock in Round 17, they played rock again.\n   There's no consistent pattern, but most recently they stuck with rock after losing with it.\n\n7. After consecutive losses with the same move, players often switch strategies.\n\n8. Given that they've now lost twice in a row with rock, they might:\n   - Finally switch away from rock after four consecutive rock plays\n   - Switch to scissors to counter my paper\n   - Switch to paper to try something completely different\n\n9. The most logical response after losing twice to paper would be to play scissors.\n\n10. If they switch to scissors, rock would be my optimal counter.\n\n11. Given their historical patterns (strong preference for rock) balanced against the psychological pressure to change after consecutive losses, rock seems like the strongest move - it would beat scissors if they finally switch, and it disrupts the current dynamic of me playing paper against their rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Common strategies after losing include:\n   - Switching to what would have beaten the opponent's move (paper would beat my rock)\n   - Switching to what the opponent just played (rock)\n   - Sticking with the current move hoping for better luck (scissors)\n\n8. Given their historical preference for rock and their previous behavior after losing with scissors, there's a good chance they'll switch back to rock.\n\n9.

After a paper-paper tie specifically, we have no historical data since this is the first one.\n\n8. Common psychology after ties suggests players often switch to a different move.\n\n9.

After consecutive wins:\n   - After Rounds 6-7 (winning with rock then scissors): they played paper.\n   - After Rounds 23-24 (winning with scissors then paper): we're now looking for their next move.\n\n8. Given their historical patterns and recent success, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (following their pattern after winning with paper)\n   - Stick with paper (win-stay strategy)\n   - Switch to scissors (anticipating I'll play paper to counter their paper)\n\n9. If they switch to rock, paper would be my optimal counter.\n\n10. If they stick with paper, scissors would be my optimal counter.\n\n11.

My theory about mirroring was incorrect. After three consecutive matches where they mirrored my moves, they played scissors when I played paper.\n\n3. Looking at the most recent sequence:\n   - Round 9: They played rock (matching my rock)\n   - Round 10: They played scissors (matching my scissors)\n   - Round 11: They played rock (matching my rock)\n   - Round 12: They played scissors (beating my paper)\n\n4. This suggests they might have intentionally matched my moves for three rounds to establish a pattern, then broke it to win.\n\n5. Alternatively, they might now be playing what would beat what they expect me to play.\n\n6. After losing with paper against scissors, I need to reassess their possible strategy:\n   - They might return to matching my moves\n   - They might be trying to establish a new pattern\n   - They might be playing what would beat their own previous move\n   - They might be playing what would beat my previous move\n\n7. If they're playing what would beat my previous move (paper), they would play scissors again.\n\n8. If they're playing what would beat their own previous move (scissors), they would play rock.\n\n9.

Looking at the most recent sequence:\n   - Round 17: They beat my rock with paper\n   - Round 18: Tie with rock\n   - Round 19: They beat my rock with paper again\n\n3. My opponent has beaten me with paper against rock twice in the last three rounds.\n\n4. I've played rock for the last four rounds, and my opponent seems to have adapted to this pattern.\n\n5. After winning with paper, many players would be tempted to stick with a winning move.\n\n6. However, they might also anticipate that I'll finally switch to scissors to counter their paper.\n\n7. If they expect me to play scissors, they would play rock.\n\n8. Given their recent success with paper and my predictable rock plays, there's a strong chance they'll play paper again, expecting me to stick with rock or anticipating that I might overthink and play rock to beat their expected scissors.\n\n9. However, I need to break my predictable pattern of playing rock repeatedly.\n\n10. Based on their recent success with paper against my rock, I think scissors is the best move to counter their likely paper play.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors to counter their anticipated paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We've now had two consecutive ties with different moves (scissors, then paper).\n\n4. After a tie with paper, common responses include:\n   - Sticking with paper, expecting another tie\n   - Switching to scissors to beat the opponent's expected paper\n   - Switching to rock, anticipating the opponent will switch to scissors\n\n5. Given our recent history of consecutive ties, my opponent might be trying to establish a pattern or break out of the tie cycle.\n\n6. They might expect me to play scissors (to beat their paper), in which case they would play rock.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might expect me to play rock (thinking I'll anticipate their scissors), in which case they would play paper.\n\n8. Given the psychological dynamics after consecutive ties and the overall game history, I think they're more likely to play scissors, expecting me to play paper again or to counter my potential rock play.\n\n9. To counter their anticipated scissors move, rock would be the best choice.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock to counter their anticipated scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at the most recent sequence:\n   - Round 25: Tie with scissors\n   - Round 26: Tie with paper\n   - Round 27: Tie with rock\n\n3. We've now had three consecutive ties with all three possible moves (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock).\n\n4. This is a remarkable pattern - it suggests my opponent might be deliberately matching my moves to force ties.\n\n5. After three consecutive ties with different moves, there are several possibilities:\n   - They might continue matching my move, resulting in another tie\n   - They might try to break the pattern by playing to win\n   - They might expect me to recognize the matching pattern and try to counter my counter-strategy\n\n6. If they're deliberately matching my moves, they would play whatever I play next.\n\n7. To break this pattern and win, I need to play a move that would lose to their expected move if they continue matching.\n\n8. If I play scissors and they match with scissors, it's another tie.\n   If I play paper and they match with paper, it's another tie.\n   If I play rock and they match with rock, it's another tie.\n\n9. However, if I play scissors expecting them to play paper (to beat my expected rock), I would win.\n\n10. Given the unusual pattern of three consecutive ties with different moves, I think the most strategic move is to play scissors, anticipating they might break the matching pattern and play paper (to beat my expected rock after our rock tie).\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors to counter their anticipated paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I correctly predicted their paper move after three consecutive ties, which broke the tie streak.\n\n4. After losing with paper against scissors, common responses include:\n   - Switching to rock (to beat the scissors that just beat them)\n   - Sticking with paper (thinking I won't play scissors twice)\n   - Switching to scissors (to match what just beat them)\n\n5. Given the psychological dynamics after a loss that broke a streak of ties, they're most likely to switch to rock to counter my winning scissors move.\n\n6. If they play rock, my best counter would be paper.\n\n7. However, they might also anticipate that I'll think this way and expect me to play paper, in which case they might play scissors.\n\n8. Given our history and the psychological dynamics after their loss, I think rock remains their most probable next move.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper to counter their anticipated rock move.\n\n[move] paper\n"
