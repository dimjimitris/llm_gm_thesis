Some psychological research suggests that rock is the most common first move people make, followed by scissors, then paper.\n4. If I assume the opponent might follow this pattern, choosing paper would be advantageous against the most common first move (rock).\n5. However, if the opponent is strategic, they might anticipate this reasoning and choose scissors instead.\n6.

The opponent's pattern has been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. I've now won six rounds in a row, which is an extreme losing streak for my opponent. They're certainly frustrated and desperate to break this pattern.\n\n4.

In the last round, I broke my cyclic pattern (I should have played rock according to my previous pattern), and the opponent played scissors, resulting in a tie.\n\n3. This indicates that the opponent either:\n   a) Finally broke out of their losing pattern by anticipating my pattern-break\n   b) Randomly chose scissors and got lucky\n   c) Was expecting me to play paper again (which I had played after scissors in rounds 3-4)\n\n4.

After a tie, players often switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move. Since we both played scissors, the opponent might play rock next (which beats scissors).\n\n6. Alternatively, the opponent might think I'll play rock (to beat their expected scissors), and thus play paper to counter my rock.\n\n7. Given that I broke my pattern in the last round, the opponent is now uncertain about my strategy and can't rely on predicting my moves based on the previous pattern.\n\n8.

I've now won nine rounds, with one tie and no losses. The opponent is likely completely demoralized and desperate for any success.\n\n3. The opponent's last three moves have been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, cycling through all three options.\n\n4. My last three moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, which is the natural sequence of the game.\n\n5. The opponent might have noticed this pattern and expect me to play paper next (continuing my natural cycle). If so, they would play scissors.\n\n6. However, given their consistent losses, they might try something completely unexpected or random to break their losing streak.\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern, they seem to slightly favor scissors and paper over rock.\n\n8. After losing with paper in the last round, they might:\n   a) Play rock to beat my expected scissors\n   b) Play scissors to beat my expected paper\n   c) Play paper again hoping I'll overthink and not expect a repeat\n\n9. Given their desperate situation, they might think I'll continue my winning strategy of playing the move that beats their previous move. Since they played paper last, they might expect me to play scissors again, so they might play rock.\n\n10. Alternatively, they might try to predict that I'll break my own pattern to be unpredictable, and thus play scissors expecting me to play paper.\n\n11. Considering all factors, I believe the opponent is most likely to play rock in this round - either to counter my expected scissors or simply to try something different after so many losses.\n\n12. If I expect them to play rock, my best response would be paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I've now won ten rounds, with one tie and no losses. The opponent is likely completely frustrated and may be making increasingly desperate or random choices.\n\n3. The opponent's last four moves have been: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, which completes a full cycle, followed by rock again.\n\n4. My last four moves have been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper, where I repeated paper in the last round.\n\n5. The opponent has played rock in the last two rounds and lost both times. They're very unlikely to play rock a third time.\n\n6. After losing with rock twice, the opponent will almost certainly switch to either paper or scissors.\n\n7. If they're thinking strategically, they might expect me to play scissors next (to beat their previous rock), so they might play rock again to beat my scissors. However, this seems unlikely given their consecutive losses with rock.\n\n8. More likely, they'll either:\n   a) Play paper to beat my expected rock (if they think I'll switch from paper)\n   b) Play scissors to beat my paper (if they think I'll repeat paper)\n\n9. Given that I've won so consistently, they might think I'll stick with what's working and repeat paper again. In that case, they would play scissors.\n\n10. Additionally, I've played paper twice in a row now, making scissors an even more likely choice for them.\n\n11.

We just had a tie with both of us playing rock. This is only our second tie in 18 rounds.\n\n3. The opponent broke their cycle of paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors by playing rock instead of the expected paper.\n\n4. This indicates they're trying to be less predictable and are attempting to break patterns.\n\n5. After a tie, players often switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move. Since we both played rock, they might play paper next (which beats rock).\n\n6. However, they might also anticipate that I'll expect this and instead play scissors to counter my expected paper.\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern throughout the game, after ties, they've done the following:\n   - After the tie in Round 1 (both paper), they played scissors in Round 2\n   - After the tie in Round 8 (both scissors), they played rock in Round 9\n\n8. This suggests they might follow a pattern of playing the move that would lose to their previous tied move. If this pattern holds, after rock, they would play scissors.\n\n9. However, given their long losing streak, they're likely trying new strategies and might not follow any previous pattern.\n\n10. The most logical move for them after a rock tie would be paper, as it:\n    a) Beats our previous mutual rock\n    b) Is different from their last move\n    c) Is a natural response after a tie\n\n11. If I expect them to play paper, my best response would be scissors.\n\n12.

Let me review our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n\n2. I've now won sixteen rounds, with two ties and no losses. The opponent is likely completely demoralized and making increasingly desperate choices.\n\n3. The opponent's last four moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, showing they've returned to playing paper after our rock tie.\n\n4. My last four moves have been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n5. After losing with paper in the last round, the opponent might:\n   a) Play rock to counter my expected paper (if they think I'll change to paper)\n   b) Play scissors to beat my expected paper (if they think I'll repeat scissors)\n   c) Play paper again out of frustration or randomness\n\n6. Given their long losing streak, they might be trying anything at this point, including repeating moves that have lost previously.\n\n7. Looking at their behavior after losses:\n   - They've sometimes followed a loss by playing the move that would beat what just beat them\n   - They've sometimes followed a loss by playing the move that would beat what they expect me to play next\n   - They've occasionally repeated the same move despite losing with it\n\n8. Given that they just lost with paper against my scissors, they're most likely to play rock next, as it:\n   a) Beats scissors (my last move)\n   b) Is different from their last losing move\n   c) Is a logical counter-strategy\n\n9. If I expect them to play rock, my best response would be paper.\n\n10. There's also a possibility they'll play scissors thinking I'll play paper (to counter their expected rock), but given their psychological state after so many losses, the direct counter to my last move (rock) seems most likely.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Given their extremely long losing streak, they might be trying completely random moves at this point, having exhausted all strategic options.\n\n7. Looking at their recent moves, they played rock twice in the last three rounds. This suggests they might be favoring rock slightly.\n\n8. However, after just losing with rock, they're more likely to switch to a different move.\n\n9. If they're still trying to counter my previous move (paper), they would play scissors.\n\n10. If they're trying to anticipate my next move and think I'll play rock (to counter their expected scissors), they would play paper.\n\n11. Given the psychological state after so many losses and the fact that scissors is the direct counter to my last move (paper), scissors seems like their most likely choice.\n\n12.

We just had a tie with both of us playing scissors. This is our third tie in 24 rounds.\n\n3. The opponent seems to have finally detected my pattern of rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, as they played scissors when I did, breaking their losing streak with a tie.\n\n4. After our previous ties:\n   - After the tie in Round 1 (both paper), they played scissors in Round 2\n   - After the tie in Round 8 (both scissors), they played rock in Round 9\n   - After the tie in Round 18 (both rock), they played paper in Round 19\n\n5. This suggests they might follow a pattern of playing the move that would lose to their previous tied move. If this pattern holds, after scissors, they would play paper.\n\n6. However, given that they just broke their long losing streak with a tie, they might feel encouraged to continue with scissors, thinking I might play paper next.\n\n7. After a tie, players often switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move. Since we both played scissors, they might play rock next (which beats scissors).\n\n8. If I follow my established pattern, I should play paper next (after scissors). However, now that they seem to have caught on to my pattern, I should consider breaking it.\n\n9. If they expect me to play paper next (following my pattern), they would play scissors again.\n\n10. If they play rock (to beat our mutual scissors), my best response would be paper.\n\n11. If they play paper (following their pattern after ties), my best response would be scissors.\n\n12. Given the psychological boost they just got from breaking their losing streak, and the fact that scissors just \"worked\" for them, they're most likely to repeat scissors.\n\n13.

We've now had two ties in a row, with scissors and then rock. This is unusual in our game history.\n\n3. The opponent seems to be matching my moves exactly now, perhaps having given up on trying to win and simply aiming for ties.\n\n4. After our previous rock ties:\n   - After the tie in Round 18 (both rock), they played paper in Round 19\n\n5. After a tie, players often switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move. Since we both played rock, they might play paper next (which beats rock).\n\n6. Given the recent pattern of consecutive ties, they might be trying to maintain this pattern by matching whatever they think I'll play next.\n\n7. If they think I'll play paper next (to beat our mutual rock), they would also play paper, aiming for another tie.\n\n8. Alternatively, they might play scissors, anticipating that I might play paper to beat our mutual rock.\n\n9. Given their apparent new strategy of aiming for ties rather than wins, paper seems like their most likely move - either to beat our mutual rock or to match my expected paper.\n\n10. If I expect them to play paper, my best response would be scissors.\n\n11. However, they might also be thinking one level deeper and anticipate that I'll play scissors (to counter their expected paper), in which case they would play rock.\n\n12. Given the psychological dynamics at this point and their apparent shift to a tie-seeking strategy, I believe they're most likely to play paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, which would counter their likely paper play and break the tie pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I've now won twenty-one rounds, with four ties and no losses. After two consecutive ties, I won the last round.\n\n3. The opponent's last five moves have been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n4. My last five moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n5. After losing with paper in the last round, the opponent might:\n   a) Play rock to counter my expected paper (if they think I'll change to paper)\n   b) Play scissors to beat my expected paper (if they think I'll repeat scissors)\n   c) Play paper again out of frustration or to try to break their pattern\n\n6. Given their long losing streak interrupted only by occasional ties, they might be trying various strategies at this point.\n\n7. After the two consecutive ties followed by a loss, they might return to trying to match my moves for ties, which would mean playing scissors (expecting me to play scissors again).\n\n8. Alternatively, they might try to counter my previous move (scissors) directly by playing rock.\n\n9. Given the psychological dynamics at this point and their recent behavior of matching moves for ties followed by playing paper, I believe they're most likely to play rock in this round (to counter my scissors).\n\n10. If I expect them to play rock, my best response would be paper.\n\n11. There's also a possibility they'll play scissors thinking I'll play paper (to counter their expected rock), but given their recent behavior and the direct counter to my last move, rock seems most likely.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round, which would counter their likely rock play.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I've now won twenty-two rounds, with four ties and no losses. I've won the last two rounds after two consecutive ties.\n\n3. The opponent's last six moves have been: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, showing they've played rock twice in the last three rounds.\n\n4. My last six moves have been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, which has been effective.\n\n5. After losing with rock in the last round, the opponent might:\n   a) Play paper to beat my expected rock (if they think I'll repeat paper)\n   b) Play scissors to beat my expected paper (if they think I'll continue with my pattern)\n   c) Play rock again out of frustration or randomness\n\n6. Given their extremely long losing streak with only occasional ties, they might be making increasingly desperate or random choices.\n\n7. Looking at their recent behavior, they seem to be alternating between trying to match my moves (for ties) and trying to counter my previous move.\n\n8. After losing with rock against my paper, if they're trying to counter my previous move, they would play scissors.\n\n9. If they're trying to predict my next move based on patterns, they might expect me to play rock next (after paper) and play paper to counter it.\n\n10. Given their recent tendency to play rock frequently and their likely frustration, scissors seems like their most probable move - it directly counters my previous paper and would be a change from their recent rock plays.\n\n11. If I expect them to play scissors, my best response would be rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, which would counter their likely scissors play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given their extremely long losing streak, they might be making increasingly desperate or random choices.\n\n7. Looking at their recent behavior, they've played rock \u2192 scissors after paper \u2192 rock in rounds 26-27, suggesting they might be developing a pattern of playing the move that would lose to their previous move.\n\n8. If this pattern holds, after scissors they would play paper.\n\n9. Additionally, if they're trying to counter my previous move (rock), they would also play paper.\n\n10. If they're trying to predict my next move and think I'll play scissors (following a rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper pattern), they would play rock.\n\n11.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
