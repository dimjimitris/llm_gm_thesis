In rock-paper-scissors, no single move is inherently better than others in a one-shot game against a rational opponent.\n2. Since this is the first round and I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" I have no prior information about their tendencies.\n3. In the absence of information, I need to consider what most players might choose in their first move.\n4. Many novice players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n5. If I anticipate my opponent choosing rock, my optimal response would be paper.\n6. However, if the opponent is strategic, they might anticipate this reasoning and choose scissors instead.\n7. Given this uncertainty, I'll choose rock for this initial round, as it's effective against scissors if the opponent is thinking one step ahead.\n8. After this round, I can potentially start identifying patterns in my opponent's play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this first round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We just had a scissors-scissors tie, which is our 5th tie overall.\n\n5. Looking at my opponent's pattern after ties:\n   - After rock-rock tie (Round 6), they played paper (Round 7)\n   - After rock-rock tie (Round 8), they played paper (Round 9)\n   - After paper-paper tie (Round 9), they played paper again (Round 10)\n   - Now after scissors-scissors tie, what will they play?\n\n6. Their pattern suggests they might choose the move that would have beaten what just tied (rock beats scissors).\n\n7. However, they've also shown a tendency to stick with moves (played paper 3 times in a row recently).\n\n8. After a scissors-scissors tie, the most common response would be to switch to rock (which beats scissors).\n\n9. If I expect them to play rock, my best counter would be paper.\n\n10. This also takes advantage of their possible tendency to repeat moves - if they unexpectedly play scissors again, we would tie rather than me losing.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   I've finally broken my losing streak by winning with rock against scissors.\n\n4. Interestingly, I won with the same combination as in Round 1 and Round 4 (my rock beating their scissors).\n\n5. After a loss, players often switch strategies. My opponent just lost with scissors, so they might switch to rock or paper.\n\n6. However, they might also be trying to identify a pattern in my play. Since I just won with rock, they might expect me to play rock again.\n\n7. If they expect me to play rock again, they would likely play paper to counter.\n\n8. If I expect them to play paper, my best move would be scissors.\n\n9. However, if they anticipate this line of thinking, they might play rock instead to beat my scissors.\n\n10. Given the psychological dynamics at this point, where I've just broken a long losing streak, and considering that my opponent seems to be good at anticipating moves, I'll choose paper - which would beat their rock if they anticipate my scissors, and would lose to their scissors if they try to counter my potential rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This is interesting - I've won the last two rounds with different moves (rock then paper).\n\n5. After consecutive losses, players often change their strategy significantly. My opponent just lost twice in a row, so they might be reconsidering their approach.\n\n6. Looking at our history:\n   - In Round 18, I won with rock against their scissors\n   - In Round 19, I won with paper against their rock\n   - This suggests they might be trying to counter my previous move each time\n\n7. If they continue this pattern of trying to counter my last move, they might expect me to play scissors next (since I just won with paper).\n\n8. If they expect scissors from me, they would likely play rock to counter.\n\n9. If I expect them to play rock, my best move would be paper.\n\n10. However, they might also break their pattern after two consecutive losses and try something completely different, like playing scissors to beat my potential paper.\n\n11.

If they continue this alternating pattern, they would play rock next.\n\n8. If I expect them to play rock, my best move would be paper.\n\n9. However, after three consecutive losses, they might break their pattern entirely and try something new.\n\n10.

Given the psychological dynamics at this point, where I've won three in a row and they're likely frustrated, I'll choose scissors - which would beat their paper if they try to counter my potential rock, and would lose to their rock if they continue their alternating pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This is a remarkable winning streak - I've won four rounds in a row with a diverse set of moves.\n\n5.

After losing with paper, they might switch to rock (to beat my potential scissors) or scissors (to beat my potential paper).\n\n9.

After four consecutive losses, they're likely to try something completely different, possibly returning to their most comfortable move - scissors.\n\n12.

Interestingly, my opponent has played paper three times in a row, and I've won against their paper with scissors in the last round.\n\n5. When players lose, they typically change their strategy. After losing with paper against my scissors, my opponent might switch to rock (to beat my potential scissors again) or scissors (to tie with my potential scissors or beat my potential paper).\n\n6. However, they've shown unusual persistence by playing paper three times in a row, which suggests they might have a specific strategy in mind.\n\n7. If I expect them to switch to rock after losing with paper, my best move would be paper.\n\n8. If I expect them to switch to scissors, my best move would be rock.\n\n9. Given their unusual persistence with paper and the fact that they just lost with it, I think they're more likely to switch to rock to counter my potential scissors play (since I just won with scissors).\n\n10.

Given that scissors has been their most frequent choice throughout the game, and they just won with it, there's a good chance they might stick with scissors.\n\n8. If I expect them to play scissors again, my best move would be rock.\n\n9. If I expect them to anticipate this and play paper, my best move would be scissors.\n\n10. Given their tendency to play scissors frequently throughout the game, and the fact that they just won with it, rock seems like the most strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   We've had another tie.\n\n4. After a paper-paper tie, players often switch to scissors to beat the previous paper move.\n\n5. Looking at my opponent's pattern after ties:\n   - After rock-rock tie (Round 6), they played paper (Round 7)\n   - After rock-rock tie (Round 8), they played paper (Round 9)\n   - After paper-paper tie (Round 9), they played paper again (Round 10)\n   - After scissors-scissors tie (Round 11), they played scissors again (Round 12)\n   - After scissors-scissors tie (Round 14), they played paper (Round 15)\n   - Now after paper-paper tie, what will they play?\n\n6. Their pattern suggests they might stick with paper or switch to scissors. They've rarely played rock after a tie.\n\n7. If they expect me to switch to scissors (to beat the previous paper), they would likely play rock.\n\n8. If they stick with paper, my best move would be scissors.\n\n9. If they switch to scissors, my best move would be rock.\n\n10. If they switch to rock, my best move would be paper.\n\n11. Given their historical pattern after ties and the psychological dynamics at this point, I think they're more likely to play rock (expecting my scissors) than to stick with paper or switch to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

We've had two consecutive paper-paper ties, which is unusual.\n\n5. After two consecutive paper-paper ties, there's a strong psychological pressure to switch to scissors to break the pattern.\n\n6. If my opponent is thinking the same way, they're likely to switch to scissors.\n\n7. If I expect them to play scissors, my best move would be rock.\n\n8. However, they might also anticipate this thinking and play rock (to beat my potential scissors), or even stick with paper a third time (thinking I'll play rock to beat their scissors).\n\n9. Given the unusual situation of two consecutive paper-paper ties, and the psychological dynamics at this point, I think scissors is the least likely move for them to make.\n\n10.

My opponent's moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   They've played paper three times in a row, resulting in ties.\n\n3. My moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   I've also played paper three times in a row.\n\n4. This is an extremely unusual situation with three consecutive paper-paper ties.\n\n5. At this point, there's an even stronger psychological pressure to break this pattern.\n\n6. The most natural move to break a paper streak would be scissors.\n\n7. My opponent is likely thinking the same way, so they might play:\n   a) Scissors - to break the paper pattern\n   b) Rock - anticipating that I'll switch to scissors\n   c) Paper again - thinking I'll overthink and play rock to counter their potential scissors\n\n8. After three consecutive paper-paper ties, option (a) seems most likely - they'll probably switch to scissors to break the pattern.\n\n9. If I expect them to play scissors, my best move would be rock.\n\n10. The risk of them playing paper a fourth time seems lower than the risk of them switching to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
