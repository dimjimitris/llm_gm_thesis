The Psychological Analyzer proposes that the opponent might be trying to create a sense of frustration and desperation.\n\nThe Randomizer recommends making a random move, but the Strategic Thinker proposes a more thoughtful approach. Given the opponent's tendency to mirror our moves, we can try to make a move that would normally be a good choice, but also be prepared for the possibility that the opponent will mirror us again. The Strategic Thinker suggests choosing \"paper\", as it's a move that can potentially beat the opponent's expected move, and it's a move that we've made before with some success.\n\nThe Strategic Thinker also considers the fact that we've been tied for many rounds, and it's time to try something that might break the pattern. Instead of trying to outsmart the opponent, we can try to make a move that would give us a good chance of winning, even if the opponent mirrors us. However, since the opponent is mirroring our moves, we need to think about what move they would make if they were trying to beat us. In this case, choosing \"paper\" would be a good option, as it would beat the opponent's potential \"rock\" move, but since the opponent is mirroring us, we should be prepared for another tie.\n\n[move] (Trying to break the tie pattern with a move that can beat the opponent's potential move) paper\n"

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors.
