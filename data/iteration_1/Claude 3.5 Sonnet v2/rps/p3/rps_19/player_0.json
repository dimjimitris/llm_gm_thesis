    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, if they're thinking the same way, they might choose paper expecting rock, in which case scissors would be good. Given the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when it wins, while rock and scissors only give 1 point.\n\n[move] paper A balanced opening move that offers the highest potential reward if successful\n"

Round 27: scissors vs paper (I won)\n5. Round 28: rock vs rock (tie)\n\nMy score remains at +4 points. The situation shows:\n- The tie broke my winning streak but maintained my lead\n- They finally stopped their losing streak with the tie\n- We're back in a more defensive position\n\nAfter this rock tie, they might:\n- Play paper to counter expected rock continuation\n- Use scissors anticipating my paper counter to rock\n- Stay with rock expecting me to overthink\n\nGiven that:\n- They've shown good ability to read conventional responses\n- They need to make up points\n- They might expect me to play paper after rock tie\n\nI'll make the less conventional choice and play rock again. This might:\n- Catch them using scissors to counter my expected paper\n- Create psychological pressure by maintaining the same move\n- At worst risk -3, which I can afford with my +4 buffer\n\n[move] rock Maintaining rock to catch potential scissors counter\n"

The situation shows:\n- We've now had two consecutive rock ties\n- The game has shifted from my winning streak to defensive ties\n- They've matched my rock plays twice\n\nAfter two rock ties, there's extreme pressure to play paper, but:\n- They've consistently shown they can read obvious responses\n- They might be setting up this exact trap\n- They need big point swings to catch up\n\nThe conventional wisdom would be to play paper here, but that's likely exactly what they're expecting. Given their demonstrated skill at prediction and their need to make up points, they're probably ready with scissors to catch that paper play.\n\nI'll make the highly unconventional choice to play rock a third time. This might:\n- Catch them trying to punish my expected paper with scissors\n- Continue the psychological pressure\n- Protect my lead even if they play paper (-3 is acceptable with my +4 buffer)\n\n[move] rock Maintaining rock for third time to catch scissors counter\n"
