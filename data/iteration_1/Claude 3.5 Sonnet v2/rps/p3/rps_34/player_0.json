    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the risk/reward:\n   - Paper has the highest potential payoff (+3)\n   - But also the highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Rock and Scissors have more balanced payoffs (+1/-1)\n\n4. Since this is the first move:\n   - I want to play somewhat conservatively\n   - But I also want to have a chance at the higher payoff\n   - Paper would give me the highest reward if successful\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - I'll choose paper since it has the highest potential gain\n   - Even though it's riskier, establishing an aggressive first move might influence future gameplay\n   - If successful, it will give me a strong early lead with +3 points\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at potential counter-strategies:\n   - If they switch to scissors (likely), paper would be bad\n   - If they stick to rock (unlikely), paper would win again\n   - If they play paper (possible), it would be a tie\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - I'm already ahead by 3 points\n   - I can afford to play more conservatively\n   - I should protect against the most likely counter (scissors)\n\n5.

Strategic decision:\n   - I'll play paper\n   - This counters their likely switch to rock\n   - If they try scissors to counter my expected rock, I only lose 1 point\n   - If they stubbornly stick with paper (unlikely after losing), it's a tie\n   - This maintains aggressive play while keeping potential losses minimal\n   - It also breaks any pattern they might expect from me\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyzing updated game history:\n   - Round 20: rock vs scissors (won +1)\n   - Round 21: paper vs paper (tie)\n   - Round 22: rock vs scissors (won +1)\n   - Total score: now +7 points\n   - Their recent moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - They briefly broke their scissors pattern with paper\n   - Then immediately returned to scissors\n   - Their paper play now looks like it might have been a feint\n   - They've lost multiple times with scissors but keep returning to it\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - They seem unable to break away from scissors despite losses\n   - The brief paper play suggests they can change but lack commitment\n   - They might be frustrated and playing reactively\n   - Their decision-making appears increasingly unstable\n   - They need significant points but aren't playing for high rewards\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Very strong position with +7 lead\n   - Game might be nearing its end\n   - They need multiple successful plays to catch up\n   - Their scissors fixation makes them predictable\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - I'll play rock again\n   - Reasoning:\n     - They've shown a strong tendency to return to scissors\n     - If they play scissors again (likely given history), I win +1\n     - If they play paper to counter rock, I lose 3 but maintain +4 lead\n     - With such a strong lead, protecting against scissors is priority\n     - They haven't shown commitment to paper plays\n     - Their erratic behavior suggests they might stick with scissors\n     - Sometimes the simplest counter-strategy is most effective\n\n[move] rock\n"
