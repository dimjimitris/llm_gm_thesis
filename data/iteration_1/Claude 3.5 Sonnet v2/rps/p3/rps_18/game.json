However, they might also be adapting to our moves and outcomes rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\nSince they just won with rock, there's a decent chance they might stick with it due to its success.

This would:\n- Beat paper if they make the obvious move to counter our rock ties\n- Lose to rock if they stick with it, but only for -1 points\n- This play accepts a small potential loss while setting up for a possible win against the logical paper counter\n\n[move] scissors\n"
