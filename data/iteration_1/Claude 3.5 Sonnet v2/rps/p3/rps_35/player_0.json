    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's analyze the payoff structure:\n   * Paper beating rock gives highest reward (3 points)\n   * Rock beating scissors gives moderate reward (1 point)\n   * Scissors beating paper gives moderate reward (1 point)\n\n3. Since I have no information about the opponent:\n   * Each move is equally likely from them\n   * I should consider the expected value of each move\n\n4. Expected value calculation:\n   * Paper: Win 3 (vs rock), Lose -1 (vs scissors), Tie 0 (vs paper)\n   * Rock: Win 1 (vs scissors), Lose -3 (vs paper), Tie 0 (vs rock)\n   * Scissors: Win 1 (vs paper), Lose -1 (vs rock), Tie 0 (vs scissors)\n\n5. Based on this:\n   * Paper has potential for highest reward but moderate risk\n   * Rock has potential for moderate reward but highest risk\n   * Scissors has balanced risk-reward ratio\n\n6.

Recent pattern analysis:\n   * Last three moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   * They're showing a strong preference for paper\n   * But paper keeps losing to scissors\n   * They've lost their last two rounds\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * They've lost multiple times to scissors\n   * They're likely feeling very frustrated with paper losses\n   * After multiple losses to scissors, players typically:\n     * Either switch to rock to beat scissors\n     * Or stubbornly stick with paper hoping opponent switches\n\n4. Meta-game consideration:\n   * They might expect me to use scissors again\n   * Rock would be their safest counter to expected scissors\n   * They haven't used rock in a while\n   * Rock would break their recent paper pattern\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   * If they play rock (most likely): paper wins (+3)\n   * If they stick with paper (possible): scissors wins (+1)\n   * If they play scissors (least likely): rock wins (+1)\n\n6. Decision:\n   * Given their likely frustration with paper losses\n   * And their need to counter scissors\n   * They're most likely to switch to rock\n   * Paper gives us the best potential reward\n\n[move] paper\n"
