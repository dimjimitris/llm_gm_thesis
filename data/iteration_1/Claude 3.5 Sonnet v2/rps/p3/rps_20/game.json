Opponent behavior analysis:\n- They appear to be reactive rather than strategic\n- They've tried to counter my previous moves but been one step behind\n- They've shown a pattern of changing moves each round\n- They haven't used paper yet\n\n3. Psychological projection:\n- After losing twice, they're likely to:\n   a) Try to break their losing streak with a completely different approach\n   b) Finally use paper, which hasn't been played by them yet\n   c) Try to predict my next move based on my pattern\n\n4. Pattern consideration:\n- My pattern has been paper \u2192 rock\n- They might expect me to complete a cycle with scissors\n\n5.
