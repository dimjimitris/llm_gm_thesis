Decision making:\n   - Opponent likely expects either:\n   * Rock again (building on success)\n   * Scissors (anticipating their paper counter)\n   - Going with paper:\n   * Beats rock if they try to counter my scissors\n   * Offers highest potential gain (+3)\n   * Unexpected after just winning with rock\n   * Has worked well in beginning of game\n\n[move] paper\n"

Fundamental analysis:\n   - Every strategic approach has failed\n   - Opponent has consistently outmaneuvered me\n   - They seem to predict both:\n     * Logical responses\n     * Counter-intuitive plays\n     * Pattern breaks\n     * Defensive moves\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n   - They're on a dominant winning streak\n   - They've shown masterful prediction abilities\n   - They might expect me to be frustrated\n   - They might expect desperate moves\n\n4. Core strategy reset:\n   - Previous attempts at strategy haven't worked\n   - Need to accept that opponent is extremely skilled\n   - Complex thinking has been counterproductive\n   - Need absolute simplicity\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Going with scissors:\n   * Simple, direct response to their last paper play\n   * They might expect more complexity given my situation\n   * If they overthink and play rock, I only lose 1\n   * If they play paper, I finally win\n   * Sometimes the most basic move is the least expected\n   - When all else fails, return to fundamentals\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
