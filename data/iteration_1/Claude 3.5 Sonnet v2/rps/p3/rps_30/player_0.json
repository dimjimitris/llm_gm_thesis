    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and patterns\n3.

This makes it an attractive first move against a fresh opponent who might default to rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Against a fresh player, people often choose rock as their first move as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. This psychological tendency could be exploited.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the risk-reward ratio:\n- Paper: Win = +3 (vs rock), Lose = -1 (vs scissors)\n- Rock: Win = +1 (vs scissors), Lose = -3 (vs paper)\n- Scissors: Win = +1 (vs paper), Lose = -1 (vs rock)\nPaper has the best risk-reward ratio in this case.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper offers the highest potential gain while minimizing potential losses.

A sophisticated player who anticipated our paper strategy\n2. A player who likes to be unpredictable\n3. Or simply random choice\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they won with scissors, they might:\n1. Stick with a winning move (some players do this)\n2. Expect us to avoid paper now and switch to rock, in which case they might choose paper\n3. Try to stay unpredictable\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our options considering the previous round:\n1. Rock: Safe against their previous scissors, wins +1 if they repeat, loses -3 if they predict and use paper\n2. Paper: Risky given their previous scissors choice\n3. Scissors: Ties if they repeat, wins against paper, loses to rock\n\nGame Strategist: Given the opponent showed sophisticated thinking in round 1, they're likely to expect us to choose rock to counter their previous scissors. Therefore, they might choose paper to counter our expected rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. If they're thinking ahead, paper would be their logical choice to counter our expected rock. Therefore, scissors would be our best counter-move.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological dynamics support this analysis. Players often try to think one step ahead of their opponents, and in this case, they're likely expecting us to play rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Based on the expectation that our opponent will anticipate our rock counter to their previous scissors, and thus choose paper, we choose scissors.\n"

They might assume we'll switch to rock to beat their apparent scissors preference\n2. They might switch themselves, expecting our rock\n3. They might stick to scissors to test if we're pattern-following\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze based on their shown behavior:\n1. If they truly favor scissors: Rock gives us +1\n2.

A strategic player would likely switch now, expecting us to counter with rock. Their most logical move would be paper to counter our expected rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The double scissors feels like pattern establishment. Many players use this technique to set up expectations before breaking the pattern. They're likely to switch now.\n\nRisk Analyst: However, if we're wrong and they do use scissors again, using paper would be costly. But given the higher reward potential (+3) with paper versus the lower reward (+1) with rock, we should focus on countering their most likely strategic move.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown sophisticated play so far.

A player testing our adaptability\n\nGame Strategist: Three scissors in a row changes the dynamics significantly:\n1. It's either an extremely rigid strategy\n2. Or it's a very sophisticated play expecting us to finally switch to rock after multiple scissors plays\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate the situation:\n1.

They've shown strategic thinking in their plays\n3. They know we're under pressure to play rock\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. Playing rock here is exactly what they want us to do. The most likely scenario is they'll finally switch to paper, expecting our rock counter to their scissors streak.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a classic \"when they think we think they think\" situation.

The risk/reward ratio doesn't support a long-term paper trap. They're likely trying to use our memory of their rock trap to make us abandon a working strategy.\n"

We just lost 3 points playing too cautiously\n2. Our lead reduced from +8 to +5\n3. They successfully baited our defensive play\n4. They might expect us to play more aggressively now\n\nRisk Analyst: Current situation:\n1. Lead reduced to +5 points\n2. Took maximum possible loss (-3)\n3. They've shown excellent read of our strategy\n4. Need to balance aggression and protection\n\nGame Strategist: Their likely expectations:\n1. We might switch to scissors to counter their paper\n2. We could play paper expecting them to return to rock\n3. We might maintain rock out of continued caution\n4. They've demonstrated excellent prediction ability\n\nPsychology Expert: Key psychological factors:\n1. The -3 loss creates pressure to recover points\n2. They might expect us to abandon defensive play\n3. Could be setting up another multi-move paper sequence\n4. Or expecting an emotional response to the loss\n\nRisk Analyst: Decision matrix:\n1. Scissors: Aggressive counter to paper (+1/-1)\n2. Rock: Risky after just losing to paper (+1/-3)\n3. Paper: Complex mind game potential (+3/-1)\n\nGame Strategist: Strategic considerations:\n1. They've proven they can read defensive patterns\n2. They might expect an aggressive response\n3. Could be starting another long paper sequence\n4. Or setting up for immediate switch\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After losing 3 points to paper while playing defensively, we'll switch to scissors. While they might expect this counter to their paper play, their previous patterns suggest they often maintain moves for multiple rounds, especially after successful plays. They might expect us to avoid scissors thinking it's too obvious, or to play paper expecting them to return to rock. With a still-healthy +5 lead, we can afford to make the aggressive play here, which wins against their potential paper continuation while only risking a small loss against rock.\n"

They maintained paper after losing to scissors\n2. This mirrors their previous pattern commitments\n3. They're showing consistent strategic behavior\n4. Their losses don't immediately change their strategy\n\nRisk Analyst: Current situation:\n1. Back to +6 points after winning\n2. They've shown pattern consistency again\n3. They've maintained paper through a loss\n4. Similar to their previous multi-round commitments\n\nGame Strategist: Pattern analysis:\n1. They often maintain moves despite losses\n2. Previous patterns showed strong commitment\n3. They might expect us to doubt a third scissors\n4. Could be setting up another long-term position\n\nPsychology Expert: Their likely mindset:\n1. They know scissors worked twice for us\n2. They might expect us to avoid a third scissors\n3. Could be trying to make scissors feel too obvious\n4.

Paper: Risky against potential scissors (+3/-1)\n\nGame Strategist: Their possible strategies:\n1. Maintain paper to test our resolve\n2. Switch to rock expecting another scissors\n3. Switch to scissors to completely surprise us\n\nPsychology Expert: Psychological dynamics:\n1. Two successful scissors creates pressure\n2. They might expect us to overthink\n3. Their commitment suggests confidence\n4. Could be using our pattern recognition against us\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors We'll maintain scissors for a third time. While this might seem predictable, their consistent pattern behavior suggests they often maintain moves even through losses. They might expect us to avoid scissors thinking it's too obvious after two successes, similar to how they maintained paper through losses in earlier rounds. Their strategy throughout the game has shown they prefer to commit to moves for multiple rounds rather than make immediate switches after losses. Sometimes the straight-forward play is correct, even when both players know it's obvious.\n"
