    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For studying opponent behavior and identifying trends\n3. Statistical Expert - For probability analysis and optimal move selection\n4. Psychologist - For understanding opponent psychology and predicting behavior\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Strategist: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no prior history, we should consider basic game theory. In a single isolated round with no prior information, each move has equal theoretical probability of success.\n\nStatistical Expert: Agreed. In a completely random scenario, each move has a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tying. No move has inherent statistical advantage.\n\nPsychologist: In first moves, many players tend to choose rock as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"safe\". This is a common psychological pattern in new players.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move with no historical data, we can't analyze patterns yet. However, we can use the psychology insight to inform our decision.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the psychological tendency for new players to choose rock, paper would be a theoretically advantageous first move.\n\nAll personas agree on using this insight for the first move.\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first round against a new player, statistics suggest that rock is a common first move choice, making paper a strategic counter-choice.\n"

They might stick with paper, thinking we wouldn't expect them to repeat\n2. They might switch to scissors to beat our paper, assuming we'll play paper again\n\nStatistical Expert: After a tie, players often tend to change their move rather than repeat it. Historical game data suggests this is more common than move repetition.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the options:\n- If they stick with paper: rock would tie, scissors would win, paper would tie\n- If they switch to scissors (most likely): rock would win, scissors would tie, paper would lose\n- If they switch to rock (least likely): rock would tie, scissors would lose, paper would win\n\nPattern Analyst: Given they showed strategic thinking in round 1, and considering the psychological tendency to change moves after a tie, scissors is their most probable move.\n\nGame Strategist: Therefore, rock would be our optimal counter-move, protecting against their likely scissors play while only risking a tie against the less likely rock choice.\n\nAll personas agree on this analysis.\n\n[move] rock Based on the previous tie with paper and the tendency of players to switch moves after a tie, we anticipate our opponent might choose scissors, making rock our optimal counter-move.\n"

Following this logic, paper would be their most rational choice to counter our previous winning rock.\n\nGame Strategist: If we predict they'll play paper, scissors would be our optimal move.\n\nPsychologist: Agreed.

Relief from breaking the losing streak\n2. Desire to capitalize on the momentum shift\n3. Likely to avoid another passive tie\n4. May see this as their chance to break through\n\nGame Strategist: If we predict they'll switch to scissors as an aggressive attempt to capitalize on breaking their losing streak, rock would be our optimal choice.\n\nAll personas strongly agree on this analysis.\n\n[move] rock Based on the psychological boost of breaking their losing streak with a tie and the common tendency to follow relief with aggression, we anticipate our opponent will choose scissors as an aggressive momentum play, making rock our optimal choice.\n"
