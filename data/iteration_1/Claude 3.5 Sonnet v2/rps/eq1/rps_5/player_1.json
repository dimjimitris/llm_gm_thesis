    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors, each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or drawing if the opponent plays completely randomly:\n   - Each move wins against one option\n   - Loses against another option\n   - Draws against itself\n\n3. Without any historical data, the safest approach is to choose randomly among the three options to be unpredictable.\n\n4. Rock is often a common first move for many players because it feels \"strong\" psychologically. This could make paper a good counter.\n\n5. However, anticipating that some players might think this way and choose paper first, scissors could be effective.\n\n6. Given this uncertainty, I'll choose rock as it's a solid defensive move and can help me gather information about the opponent's playing style.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analysis of last round:\n   - I played rock and lost to paper\n   - The opponent demonstrated they might be using the common strategy of playing paper against first-round rock\n   - They may be a strategic player rather than a random player\n\n2. Consider possible opponent strategies for this round:\n   - They might stick with what worked (paper again)\n   - They might expect me to switch to paper and play scissors\n   - They might expect me to play scissors (to counter their paper) and thus play rock\n\n3. Psychology evaluation:\n   - After winning, players sometimes get confident and stick to their winning move\n   - However, skilled players know this is predictable and will likely change\n\n4. Strategy formation:\n   - If they stick with paper, scissors wins\n   - If they switch to scissors anticipating my paper, scissors would draw\n   - If they switch to rock anticipating my scissors, scissors would lose\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given that they showed strategic thinking in round 1\n   - And that paper was successful for them\n   - I'll assume they'll expect me to counter with scissors and thus play rock\n\n6.
