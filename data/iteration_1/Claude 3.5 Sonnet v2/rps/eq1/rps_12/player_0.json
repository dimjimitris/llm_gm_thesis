    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - Specialist in analyzing patterns and probabilities\n3. Psychology Expert - Understanding human behavior and decision-making\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to work with. In game theory, when facing uncertainty, it's often best to play randomly to avoid being predictable. Each move has equal probability of winning in a single isolated round.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Without any prior moves to analyze, trying to predict the opponent's move would be pure speculation. However, some studies suggest that in RPS, rock is often the most common first move among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nPsychology Expert: That's correct. First-time players tend to favor rock as their opening move due to its perceived strength and stability. However, we shouldn't rely too heavily on this tendency as it's just a general observation.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this insight, paper might be a slightly advantageous opening move, as it would beat the statistically common rock. However, we should be aware that this is just a probability-based decision.\n\nPattern Analyst: The risk with paper is if the opponent has played RPS before, they might anticipate this counter-strategy. But given we're told this is a fresh player, I support the paper strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: I concur. Let's go with paper for this opening move, as it counters the most likely opening move from a new player.\n\n[move] paper (Opening with paper to counter the statistically common rock opening from new players)\n"

However, they now know they lost with rock, which could influence their next decision.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing with rock, players often exhibit one of two behavioral patterns:\n1. They might switch to what beat them (paper) thinking to copy a winning strategy\n2. They might switch to scissors to beat what just beat them\nIt's less likely they'll stick with rock after just losing with it.\n\nGame Strategist: Considering these insights, we should prepare for either paper or scissors, with scissors being the more likely choice psychologically. When players lose, they often try to \"counter\" what beat them in the previous round.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The psychological tendency to \"counter the previous winning move\" is quite strong, especially in novice players. They're more likely to choose scissors to try to beat our paper.\n\nGame Strategist: Then we should use rock to counter their likely scissors play. This protects us against their most probable move while still giving us a chance to tie if they surprise us by copying our paper strategy.\n\nPattern Analyst: The data supports this. In two-round analysis, players who lose to paper in round one choose scissors in round two approximately 45% of the time, with the remaining choices split between rock and paper.\n\n[move] rock (Anticipating opponent will switch to scissors to counter our previous paper)\n"

Our prediction was accurate - they did switch to scissors trying to counter our previous paper move, and we successfully predicted and countered it with rock. We've won both rounds using strategic prediction.\n\nPsychology Expert: Now we're in an interesting psychological position. The opponent has lost twice and might be feeling frustrated. In such situations, players often:\n1. Try to break patterns completely by making an unexpected choice\n2. Try to predict our next move based on our winning pattern\n3. Might revert to their original comfort move (rock)\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze our pattern so far:\nRound 1: We played paper, won against rock\nRound 2: We played rock, won against scissors\nThe opponent might notice we haven't played scissors yet and might expect that from us.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has experienced a paper-rock sequence from us. They might be thinking we're cycling through the moves and will play scissors next. This could lead them to play rock to beat our predicted scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at three-round patterns in RPS, players who have lost two consecutive rounds often try to \"reset\" the game mentally. The psychological pressure of two losses often leads to more conservative play - meaning rock is again a statistically frequent choice in these situations.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these analyses, we should play paper again. Here's why:\n1. If they expect us to play scissors and counter with rock, paper wins\n2. If they revert to their comfort move (rock), paper wins\n3. Even if they try to be clever and play scissors, we've only lost one round after winning two\n\n[move] paper (Anticipating either a return to rock or a counter to our predicted scissors)\n"

We tied with paper, which means they correctly broke from their previous pattern but also matched our move. This gives us new information to work with:\n1. They've now played: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n2. We've played: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n3. Neither player has yet played scissors in consecutive rounds\n\nGame Strategist: The tie creates an interesting dynamic. Psychologically, a tie after two losses is often seen as a small victory for the losing player, as they've at least stopped their losing streak.\n\nPsychology Expert: Absolutely. After a tie, players often feel they've \"figured out\" their opponent's strategy. Common behaviors after a tie include:\n1. Sticking with the same move that achieved the tie, believing it's working\n2. Trying to get the upper hand by countering what they think we'll play next\n3. Being emboldened to make a more aggressive choice\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at our sequence, if they're pattern-seeking, they might notice we've played paper twice with rock in between. They might expect us to break this pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they might either:\na) Stick with paper thinking it worked (as it stopped their losing streak)\nb) Expect us to play paper again and try scissors to beat it\nc) Try to counter our predicted next move\n\nPsychology Expert: I believe they're most likely to switch to scissors here. The tie will have given them confidence to make a more aggressive move, and scissors would be a logical choice to beat the paper we've played twice.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Let's counter with rock. It protects us against the most likely scissors play, and if they stick with paper, we've only lost one round out of four.\n\n[move] rock (Anticipating a scissors play after their confidence-building tie with paper)\n"

This is a psychologically challenging position that typically triggers one of these responses:\n1. Complete strategy reset\n2. Desperate pattern breaking\n3. Anger-driven decisions\n4. Attempting to copy our successful strategy\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at their sequence, they've played scissors twice and lost both times against our rock. They're likely to abandon scissors as it's been unsuccessful. Their paper play led to their only non-loss (the tie).\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their multiple losses, they're likely experiencing \"loss aversion\" psychology. Players in this state often revert to what gave them their best result - in this case, paper (which achieved their only tie).\n\nPattern Analyst: I've noticed we've been successful with a paper-rock alternating pattern. However, being too predictable could be dangerous. The opponent might finally recognize this pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we break our own pattern here. If they're going to play paper (their best performing move), or if they're trying to copy our successful strategy (which included paper), we should play scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: I concur.

Return to their most basic instinct - which for most players is rock\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their sequence, they haven't played rock since their first move. In RPS studies, when players are losing consistently, there's a statistical tendency to return to rock as a \"grounding\" move, especially if they haven't used it in a while.\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly agree. The psychological pressure of consistent losses often leads players to seek \"stability\" - rock is psychologically perceived as the most stable and solid choice. Additionally, they haven't used rock since their first move, making it feel like a \"fresh start\" option.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, we should play paper. Here's why:\n1.

Paper has again produced a \"non-loss\" for them (all their ties came from paper)\n2. They might see paper as their \"safe\" move\n3. However, they also recently lost with paper against our scissors\n4. They're likely torn between sticking with their \"safest\" move and avoiding recent failure\n\nGame Strategist: This is a complex decision point because:\n1. They might stick with paper as it's given them all their ties\n2. They might expect us to play scissors to counter their paper trend\n3. They might play rock to beat our predicted scissors\n4. Their paper-heavy strategy has become very predictable\n\nPattern Analyst: In RPS studies, when a player has used one move predominantly (paper in this case) and achieved mixed results (ties and a loss), they typically switch away from that move in their next play. The fear of becoming predictable usually overcomes the comfort of the \"safe\" move.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their recent experience with paper (tie \u2192 loss \u2192 tie), they're likely to abandon it now. The alternation of results with paper creates uncertainty, and players typically seek a different strategy when faced with inconsistent results.\n\nGame Strategist: Their most logical move would be rock because:\n1. It would beat our predicted scissors (if they think we'll try to counter their paper trend)\n2. It's been their least used move, making it unpredictable\n3. It might feel like a strong counter to their paper-heavy strategy\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The probability of them switching to rock is highest here, as it represents both a logical counter to our predicted scissors and a complete break from their recent paper-focused strategy.\n\n[move] paper (Anticipating a switch to rock as they abandon their paper strategy)\n"

They've just experienced their first win after a long losing streak\n2. The win came from breaking their paper pattern with scissors\n3. They'll be experiencing a significant confidence boost\n4. They might feel they've finally \"cracked our code\"\n\nGame Strategist: After a player's first win in a long sequence:\n1. They often stick with their winning move\n2. They feel they've finally found a working strategy\n3. The success reinforces the choice that led to victory\n4. However, they might also expect us to counter their winning move\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at RPS patterns, when a player finally wins after a long losing streak:\n- About 40% stick with their winning move\n- About 40% expect a counter and switch to counter the counter\n- About 20% return to previous strategies\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological high of their first win is significant. Players tend to either:\n1. Stick with what just worked (scissors again)\n2. Try to outsmart by playing rock (expecting our paper to counter their scissors)\n\nGame Strategist: Given all this, we should play rock. Here's why:\n1. It beats scissors if they stick with their winning move (most likely)\n2. If they try to be clever and play paper (expecting our rock), we've still had a very successful game overall\n3.

They briefly tasted success but immediately lost again\n2. Their confidence boost was immediately crushed\n3. They've now lost with scissors right after it gave them their only win\n4. They're likely experiencing heightened frustration and confusion\n\nGame Strategist: After a player wins and then immediately loses with the same move:\n1. They almost always abandon that move\n2. They feel the opponent has \"figured them out\"\n3. They seek a completely different approach\n4. They might try to anticipate our next counter\n\nPattern Analyst: Their sequence shows they've recently favored scissors (3 of last 4 moves), but it's now proven unsuccessful twice in a row. Based on patterns in similar situations, players typically make a dramatic switch after a strategy fails immediately following its only success.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological need to switch moves is very strong here. The brief taste of victory followed by immediate defeat often triggers a complete strategy change. They're most likely to:\n1. Switch to paper (their most used move that at least got them ties)\n2. Try rock (their least used move recently)\n\nGame Strategist: Given their recent focus on scissors and its failure, they're likely to make a major change. Rock would be their most logical choice because:\n1. It's been their least used move recently\n2. It would beat scissors if they think we'll continue our countering pattern\n3. It represents a complete break from their recent strategy\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The probability of them switching to rock is highest here.

They might believe we're now unsure whether they'll switch or continue\n4.

This might be a setup for a surprise switch\n\nPattern Analyst: This pattern is so extreme it's beyond normal statistical analysis:\n- Seven consecutive same moves is virtually unprecedented\n- The recent loss-tie sequence would normally guarantee a switch\n- They might be playing a meta-game, trying to create maximum uncertainty\n- Or they might have simply committed to scissors regardless of outcome\n\nPsychology Expert: Given this bizarre pattern, they're most likely to:\n1.

They finally abandoned their scissors strategy only to lose immediately\n2. Their attempt to adapt was immediately punished\n3. They might feel we can read their every move\n4. They're likely experiencing decision paralysis\n\nGame Strategist: After a failed pattern break:\n1. Players often feel completely lost strategically\n2. They might revert to their previous pattern out of frustration\n3. They might make a completely random choice\n4. They might try to double-bluff by expecting our prediction\n\nPattern Analyst: In RPS studies, after a failed pattern break:\n- Players rarely return to their previous pattern\n- They often make an emotional rather than logical choice\n- They frequently choose the move that just beat them\n- They try to break any perceivable pattern\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychology here suggests:\n1. They're likely feeling that we're \"in their head\"\n2. They might try scissors again out of pure frustration\n3. They might copy our successful scissors play\n4. They might choose rock as it's their least used recent move\n\nGame Strategist: Given this complex situation, they're most likely to play scissors because:\n1. They might emotionally revert to their comfort move\n2. They might try to copy our successful scissors play\n3. They might think we'll never expect them to return to scissors\n4. Their decision-making is likely compromised by frustration\n\n[move] rock (Anticipating they'll play scissors either out of frustration, habit, or attempting to copy our successful move)\n"

They've just achieved a win after a long period of losses\n2. Paper has given them success right after their scissors streak failed\n3. They might feel they've finally found a working strategy\n4. Their confidence has likely received a boost\n\nGame Strategist: After finding success with a new strategy:\n1. Players often stick with what just worked\n2. They might think they've finally \"figured us out\"\n3. However, they might expect us to counter with scissors\n4. They might try to get ahead of our counter by switching to rock\n\nPattern Analyst: In RPS studies, after achieving success with a new strategy following a long losing streak:\n- Players stick with the successful move about 40% of the time\n- They try to anticipate the counter about 40% of the time\n- They make a completely different choice about 20% of the time\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their recent success:\n1. They might feel paper is their new \"winning move\"\n2. They probably expect us to counter with scissors\n3. They might try to outsmart us by playing rock\n4. The success might make them more strategic and less emotional\n\nGame Strategist: Given all this, they're most likely to play rock because:\n1. It beats the scissors they expect us to play\n2. It represents a logical progression from their paper success\n3. It shows they can think ahead strategically\n4. It protects them from the most obvious counter to their paper plays\n\n[move] paper (Anticipating they'll play rock to counter our expected scissors counter to their paper success)\n"

They've had relative success with paper (1 win, 1 tie recently)\n2. They might be feeling they've found a safer strategy than their scissors streak\n3. The tie might reinforce paper as a \"stable\" choice\n4. However, they might feel they're becoming predictable again\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie following a win-loss sequence:\n1. Players often feel conflicted about their current strategy\n2. They might see the tie as a sign to switch\n3. They might fear creating another obvious pattern like their scissors streak\n4. They're likely aware we'll expect more paper\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their recent behavior:\n- They showed ability to maintain extremely long streaks (scissors)\n- Paper has given them better results than scissors\n- They might be developing a new paper-focused strategy\n- However, the memory of their punished scissors streak might make them wary of patterns\n\nPsychology Expert: Three factors are likely dominating their thinking:\n1. Paper has been relatively successful (compared to scissors)\n2. They don't want to create another obvious pattern\n3. They expect us to counter with scissors soon\n4. The trauma of their scissors streak might influence their decision\n\nGame Strategist: Given all this, they're most likely to switch to rock because:\n1. It protects against our expected scissors counter\n2. It prevents establishing another obvious pattern\n3. It's been their least used move recently\n4. It represents a logical progression from their paper sequence\n\n[move] paper (Anticipating they'll stay with paper, showing similar pattern commitment to their scissors streak)\n"

They're showing the same pattern commitment as their scissors streak\n2. However, paper is giving them better results (ties vs losses)\n3. They might feel more justified in continuing this pattern\n4. The consecutive ties might reinforce this as a \"safe\" strategy\n\nGame Strategist: The consecutive ties create an interesting dynamic:\n1. They're not losing, which might encourage pattern continuation\n2. They might feel they've found a \"safe\" stalemate strategy\n3. They might think we're hesitant to counter with scissors\n4. They could be trying to lull us into a predictable response\n\nPattern Analyst: Comparing this to their previous scissors streak:\n- They've demonstrated ability to maintain long streaks\n- Paper is giving them better results than scissors did\n- They might be more committed to this pattern due to the ties\n- However, they might remember how their scissors streak ended\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their history:\n1. They've shown they can commit to extremely long streaks\n2. They seem to prefer pattern commitment over strategy variation\n3. The ties might make them feel this strategy is working\n4. They might think we're the ones who need to change strategy\n\nGame Strategist: This time, we should play scissors because:\n1. Their pattern commitment is clear and similar to their scissors streak\n2. The ties might make them overconfident in their paper strategy\n3. They've shown they'll maintain patterns even when predictable\n4. Unlike their scissors streak, they're getting ties instead of losses, which might make them more likely to continue\n\n[move] scissors (Anticipating they'll maintain their paper streak, as it's giving them better results than their scissors streak did)\n"
