    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In this situation, all three moves have equal probability of success since:\n   - Rock beats scissors but loses to paper\n   - Paper beats rock but loses to scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper but loses to rock\n\n3. Without any historical data, each option has a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tying.\n\n4. Common psychology in RPS suggests that rock is often a popular first move choice for many players because:\n   - It feels \"strong\" and \"stable\"\n   - It's often the first option mentioned in the game's name\n\n5. Given this psychology, I could:\n   - Play paper to beat their potential rock\n   - However, they might anticipate this and play scissors\n\n6. Since there's no clear statistical advantage, I'll make a balanced choice based on the psychological insight while keeping it unpredictable.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the common first-move tendency toward rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Psychological considerations for this round:\n   - After losing, players often change their strategy\n   - Having lost to paper, they might:\n     a) Expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors\n     b) Switch to paper themselves\n     c) Stick with rock hoping I'll change my strategy\n\n3. Common patterns after a loss:\n   - Many players tend to switch to what beat them in the previous round\n   - This would mean they might choose paper this time\n\n4. Strategic options:\n   - If they switch to paper: scissors would win\n   - If they stick to rock: paper would win again\n   - If they choose scissors: rock would win\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Since they lost to paper, there's a higher probability they'll switch to either paper or scissors\n   - Of these two likely moves, scissors would beat my previous winning move\n   - Therefore, I should protect against scissors while being able to beat paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to counter their likely switch to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Psychological analysis:\n   - After two losses, players often:\n     a) Become more unpredictable\n     b) Try to break their losing pattern\n     c) Might feel frustrated and make more aggressive choices\n\n3.

Current momentum:\n   - I've won 2 of the last 3 rounds\n   - The opponent's mirroring strategy seems disrupted\n   - Unconventional plays have been successful\n\n3. Opponent's perspective:\n   - They just lost to paper\n   - They've seen me use paper twice in a row\n   - They might expect me to change after two papers\n   - Their mirroring strategy has failed twice recently\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - After losing to paper, they might:\n     a) Play scissors to beat expected paper\n     b) Play paper themselves, returning to mirroring\n     c) Play rock again, hoping I'll switch\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - Three papers in a row would be extremely unusual\n   - They likely expect me to switch after two successful papers\n   - They might try to counter my recent success\n\n6. Risk evaluation:\n   - Scissors would be strong if they play paper\n   - Rock would be safe against expected scissors\n   - Paper would be extremely unexpected but risky\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock because:\n- Protects against their likely scissors play (countering my paper)\n- They probably expect me to change after two papers\n- It's a safer play given their recent loss\n- If they try to mirror my last move (paper), I'll lose, but it's worth the risk\n- The psychological pressure of their recent loss makes scissors their most likely move\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern recognition:\n   - Opponent's last three moves follow the classic cycle: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Their mirroring strategy has completely broken down\n   - They seem to have shifted to more predictable patterns\n\n3. Momentum analysis:\n   - I'm in a strong position with consecutive wins\n   - Opponent may be frustrated or tilted\n   - They've lost their earlier successful mirroring strategy\n   - Their moves are becoming more conventional\n\n4. Opponent's psychological state:\n   - Likely frustrated after consecutive losses\n   - Might be searching for a new strategy\n   - Could either:\n     a) Return to mirroring (their most successful strategy)\n     b) Complete their pattern cycle\n     c) Make an emotional/aggressive play\n\n5.
