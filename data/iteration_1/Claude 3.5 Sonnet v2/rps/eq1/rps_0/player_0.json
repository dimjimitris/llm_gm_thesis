    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

A 19-1 record against me suggests my opponent either has advance knowledge of my moves or is using a system that can predict my decisions with near-perfect accuracy. In a fair game, even against a skilled player, such a lopsided record would be statistically almost impossible given the game's balanced nature. While I continue to make logical moves by countering their last play, I recognize that they've demonstrated they can defeat virtually any strategy I attempt.\n"

The record of 20-1 is beyond statistically improbable in a fair game of rock-paper-scissors - it's essentially impossible without my opponent having access to my moves in advance or using a system that can predict my decisions. Even perfect strategy in rock-paper-scissors should only win around 1/3 of the time against rational play. I'm making this counter to their last move knowing they've demonstrated they can defeat any strategy I employ, whether it's simple counters, pattern recognition, or complex meta-gaming.
