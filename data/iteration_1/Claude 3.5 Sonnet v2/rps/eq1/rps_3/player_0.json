    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For studying opponent behavior and identifying patterns\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy or patterns. In such cases, game theory suggests that each option (rock, paper, scissors) should have an equal probability of being chosen to maintain unpredictability.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move, we indeed have no historical data to analyze. However, research has shown that rock is often a common first move choice among players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\nRisk Manager: Given that rock is a common first move, we could consider playing paper to counter this tendency. However, if we're wrong, we risk losing to scissors. Each move carries equal risk in terms of points (-1 if we lose, 0 if tie, +1 if win).\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing paper. Even though all moves are theoretically equal, exploiting the psychological tendency of first-time players to choose rock gives us a slight edge.\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's proceed with paper, but we should carefully observe the opponent's response to inform our future moves.\n\n[move] paper (Choosing paper as it counters the common first-move tendency of choosing rock while maintaining a balanced risk-reward profile)\n"

They follow similar strategic thinking to us\n2. They might have a preference for paper\n3. It could be just coincidence\n\nGame Strategist: Given that both players chose paper, we need to consider what a rational opponent might do next. They might:\n1. Stick with paper hoping we'll change\n2. Switch to scissors expecting us to play paper again\n3. Switch to rock to mix things up\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing paper in the first round. Against a strategic player, we should avoid being too predictable. Since they might expect us to play paper again, and might counter with scissors, we should consider switching to rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree with the Risk Manager. Playing rock protects us against the most likely counter-move (scissors) while only being vulnerable to paper, which would require our opponent to make the same move twice in a row.\n\nGame Strategist: Rock also has psychological value here - after a tie with paper, many players look to \"break through\" with scissors, making rock a strong counter-choice.\n\n[move] rock (Protecting against the likely scissors counter-move while avoiding the predictability of repeating paper)\n"

They're using similar strategic reasoning\n3. Pure coincidence, though less likely after two matches\n\nGame Strategist: If they are indeed mirroring our moves, they would need to have some way to predict our choices. Given that they can't see our collaboration, this seems unlikely. More probably, they're using similar game theory principles.\n\nRisk Manager: The pattern of two ties suggests we're dealing with a sophisticated player. In such cases, we need to think one level deeper. After rock-rock tie, many players would:\n1. Expect scissors to break the pattern\n2. Or stick with rock hoping for stability\n3. Or play paper to beat an expected rock\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at the sequence paper\u2192rock, the natural progression in rock-paper-scissors would be to scissors. This completes the cycle and is a common psychological pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: However, if our opponent is thinking the same way, they might anticipate scissors and play rock again. But if they think we'll think that, they might play paper to beat our rock.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this level of uncertainty, I suggest scissors. Here's why:\n- It beats paper if they try to counter our expected rock\n- It completes the natural cycle (paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors)\n- It breaks the pattern of matching moves\n\n[move] scissors (Breaking the pattern of matching moves while following the natural game progression)\n"

They have now played paper twice\n3. Our successful prediction suggests they are indeed using strategic reasoning\n4. They've shown a pattern of returning to paper after rock\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial moment. After losing to scissors, a strategic player typically:\n1. Won't immediately return to paper (as it just lost)\n2. Might play rock to beat the scissors they expect us to repeat\n3. Could play scissors themselves, expecting us to switch to paper\n\nRisk Manager: We need to consider the psychology after a win/loss situation. Players who just lost often:\n1. Avoid the move that just lost them points\n2. Try to counter what just beat them\n3. Sometimes stubbornly repeat their losing move to \"prove it can work\"\n\nPattern Analyst: Given their demonstrated tendency to return to paper, and the fact they just lost with paper, they're most likely to break this habit now. Rock seems their most probable move - it beats the scissors they might expect us to repeat.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. They've shown sophisticated thinking, and rock would be the most strategic choice from their perspective. We should play paper to counter this.\n\nRisk Manager: The risk of them playing scissors exists, but given their pattern and the psychology of having just lost to scissors, paper is our strongest play.\n\n[move] paper (Anticipating our opponent will play rock to counter our previous winning scissors move)\n"

Our opponent has demonstrated:\n1. Strategic depth\n2. Ability to predict our reasoning\n3. Willingness to break patterns\n4. Good use of psychological factors\n\nRisk Manager: After our loss, we need to be especially careful. The opponent has momentum and has shown they can outthink our strategic layers. In such situations, sometimes the best approach is to reduce complexity rather than add more layers of thinking.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their sequence (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), they haven't used the same move twice in a row yet. After scissors, based on pure probability and their shown patterns, they might be due for a rock or paper play.\n\nGame Strategist: Here's where we might be overthinking. In high-level RPS play, sometimes the best move is to use basic frequency analysis - they haven't played rock in a while, making it a likely choice.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with going back to basics. They've shown they can counter our complex strategies, so let's play scissors. Here's why:\n1. It's the move they haven't countered yet (they've matched paper, matched rock, lost to scissors, beat paper)\n2. If they play rock, we lose, but they might avoid rock as too obvious\n3.

They've shown a strong paper bias, even returning to it after it lost to scissors twice. However, this third loss to scissors should be a strong psychological trigger for them to finally abandon paper.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. After losing to the same move twice, even stubborn players typically change strategy. The obvious counter to our successful scissors would be rock, and given their demonstrated ability to think strategically, they're likely to make this adjustment.\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent has shown they can think ahead, but they've also shown a surprising commitment to paper. However, three losses to scissors should break anyone's pattern. Their most rational choices now are:\n1. Rock (to beat our potential scissors again)\n2. Scissors (to mix things up completely)\n3.

They've used rock twice in the last three rounds\n\nRisk Manager: After losing with rock, and seeing our success with paper, they're likely to:\n1. Avoid rock (just lost to paper)\n2. Consider scissors to beat our potential paper repeat\n3. Possibly play paper to break the pattern entirely\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their recent rock\u2192rock sequence with a loss, they're highly unlikely to play rock a third time. Given their demonstrated strategic depth, scissors would be their most logical choice to counter our potential paper repeat.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. They've shown they think ahead and will likely expect us to either:\n1. Repeat paper after our success\n2. Switch to rock expecting their scissors\n3. Play scissors ourselves to mix things up\n\nRisk Manager: Given their likely scissors play (to beat our potential paper repeat), and their demonstrated ability to think multiple levels deep, let's play rock:\n1. Beats their likely scissors play\n2. Safe against a potential third rock (though unlikely)\n3. Only vulnerable to paper, which they just faced and might avoid\n\n[move] rock (Anticipating opponent will play scissors to counter our previous winning paper move)\n"
