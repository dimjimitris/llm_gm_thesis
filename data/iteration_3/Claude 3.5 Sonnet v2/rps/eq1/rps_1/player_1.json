    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In game theory, when playing against a rational opponent with no prior information, each move should have an equal probability of being chosen (1/3 for each move).\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move and we have no historical data, we cannot identify any patterns yet. We should make a baseline move and then start collecting data on opponent behavior.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the equal payoff structure (\u00b11 point) and no prior information, there's equal risk associated with each move. No move is inherently riskier than others in this situation.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on the analysis, since we have no prior information and all moves have equal expected value in this scenario, I'll make a random choice among the three options.\n\n[move] rock\n\nThis move will establish a baseline for future rounds while having an equal chance of winning, losing, or drawing against an unknown opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Interesting first round! Our opponent chose rock, which gives us our first piece of information. In game theory, there are several possibilities to consider:\n1. They might stick to rock, thinking it worked (didn't lose)\n2. They might expect us to switch to paper (to counter their previous rock) and thus switch to scissors\n3. They might completely randomize their next move\n\nPattern Analyzer: From the single data point we have, we know the opponent used rock. While one move isn't enough to establish a definitive pattern, some players tend to stick with moves that didn't lose in the previous round. However, more sophisticated players might anticipate our adjustment and counter it.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that the opponent used rock last time:\n- If we use paper, we win if they use rock again (+1), lose if they use scissors (-1)\n- If we use scissors, we lose if they use rock again (-1)\n- If we use rock, we tie if they use rock again (0)\n\nAI Assistant: Considering all inputs, I'll choose paper for the following reasons:\n1. It beats their previous move (rock)\n2. Even if they anticipate this and switch to scissors, we've made a logical choice based on available information\n3.

If they're following this pattern, they would likely choose scissors next.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent appears to be adapting their strategy each round, moving from rock to paper. This could indicate:\n1. They're following the standard rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors sequence\n2. They're mirroring our moves with a one-round delay\n3.

It protects against the most likely next move (scissors) if they're following the standard sequence\n2. It's a safe play against paper if they mirror again\n3.
