    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

After a paper tie, the obvious move would be scissors (to beat paper), which both players know\n2. Since scissors is the obvious move, they might play rock to beat the expected scissors\n3. But knowing I might expect them to play rock, they might play paper - creating a triple-level mind game\n4. By playing rock, I'm:\n   - Protected against the scissors play (the obvious first-level strategy)\n   - Taking a calculated risk against paper (the third-level strategy)\n   - Making a play that has worked well for me several times in this game\n\nBreaking away from the obvious scissors play feels right here, especially given how many times we've mirrored moves - suggesting we often think along similar lines and might both be tempted by the obvious scissors play.\n"
