    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Game Strategist - for analyzing game theory and strategic decisions\n2. Pattern Analyst - for studying patterns and probabilities\n3. Psychology Expert - for understanding player behavior\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is a fresh player with no history, we should consider that most players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors. This is a well-documented psychological tendency, as rock is perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nGame Strategist: While that psychological insight is valuable, we should also consider that some players might be aware of this tendency and deliberately choose paper to counter the expected rock. In game theory terms, there's no dominant strategy in a single round of rock-paper-scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: Without any historical data to analyze, we're in a position of maximum uncertainty. In such cases, the optimal strategy would be to choose randomly among the three options to be unpredictable. However, given the Psychology Expert's insight about first moves, we might want to slightly favor paper.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper would be a reasonable choice here as it: 1) Beats the psychologically common first move of rock, and 2) If we're wrong, we only lose to scissors, which is a less common opening move than rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: I concur with choosing paper. Even if we're wrong, this will give us valuable information about our opponent's playing style for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on the common tendency of players to choose rock as their first move, and considering the balanced risk-reward ratio of this choice.\n"

This could mean either they're using similar strategic thinking to us, or they have their own pattern we need to decode.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent by thinking one level ahead. Since both used paper last time, they might anticipate us switching to scissors (to beat their paper), and thus they might switch to rock to beat our expected scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's break this down:\n1. If they stick with paper - scissors would win\n2. If they switch to rock (anticipating our scissors) - paper would win\n3. If they switch to scissors (trying to beat our paper) - rock would win\n\nPattern Analyst: The most complex and risky move would be scissors, as it's less commonly chosen. The safest move here might be rock, as it would beat scissors if they try to counter our previous paper move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the rock suggestion. It protects against the most aggressive counter-strategy (scissors) while only being vulnerable to paper, which they might be less likely to choose again after just using it.\n\nPsychology Expert: Rock also has the psychological advantage of feeling like a \"strong\" move after a tie, appealing to players' desire to show dominance. Let's go with rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the previous tie with paper and the likelihood of opponent trying to counter our last move with scissors\n"

A coincidence\n3. A deliberate strategy to establish a false pattern\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown sophisticated play - they predicted our rock move after the tie. This suggests they're thinking at least one level ahead of basic strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: In situations where a player has had success with a move (their paper beat our rock), they sometimes become attached to that successful move. However, skilled players know this tendency and deliberately break patterns. The opponent has shown skill, so we shouldn't assume they'll be predictable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given that paper has appeared in both rounds, scissors becomes an attractive option. However, that might be too obvious. The opponent might expect us to use scissors to counter their paper trend.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's think through the levels:\n- Level 0: They might use paper again (success bias)\n- Level 1: We might use scissors to beat their paper\n- Level 2: They might use rock to beat our scissors\n- Level 3: We might use paper to beat their rock\n\nPsychology Expert: Given that they've demonstrated higher-level thinking, we should play at Level 3.

This suggests they're using similar levels of strategic thinking to us. The question is: how will they adapt to their loss?\n\nPsychology Expert: After a loss, players often feel pressure to change their strategy. Additionally, since we've successfully predicted their last move, they're likely to try to be less predictable. The psychological pressure of having lost the last round might push them toward a more aggressive move.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at the sequence, they haven't used scissors yet. Given their demonstrated strategic depth, they might view this as a good time to introduce scissors - it would be unexpected and break any pattern we think we've detected.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's consider the levels again:\n- Level 0: They might stick with rock (stability seeking)\n- Level 1: They might switch to paper (to beat expected rock)\n- Level 2: They might use scissors (as a surprise element)\n- Level 3: We should use rock (to beat their likely scissors play)\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with the Game Strategist. The combination of loss recovery psychology and the absence of scissors in their previous moves makes scissors a likely choice for them.

While we've been trying to play complex mind games, they've been successfully using paper as their dominant strategy, only deviating once when they expected scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: This could be a sophisticated strategy of using apparent simplicity to confuse us. We keep expecting them to change their pattern, but they're winning by mostly sticking to paper. It's like the saying \"the best place to hide is in plain sight.\"\n\nPattern Analyst: At this point, we have two choices:\n1. Finally call their paper strategy with scissors\n2. Assume they're setting us up and will switch away from paper now that the pattern is so obvious\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown they can think ahead (as in Round 3), but they've also shown a strong preference for paper. If we keep trying to outthink ourselves, we'll keep losing. Sometimes the simplest answer is the right one.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. They've successfully baited us into complex predictions while using a predominantly simple strategy. It's time to call their bluff with scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: The statistics strongly support this. With 75% paper plays from our opponent, scissors is mathematically the best choice, even if they might be setting up a trap.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Following the clear statistical evidence of opponent's paper preference, while acknowledging the risk of a potential trap\n"

They established a paper-heavy pattern, waited for us to finally take the bait with scissors, then countered perfectly with rock. They're not just playing the moves, they're playing our minds.\n\nGame Strategist: We need to admire the elegance of their strategy but focus on the next move. They've demonstrated they can:\n1.

Stick with scissors (doubting our previous read of their strategy)\n\nPsychology Expert: After successfully trapping us, they might feel confident and return to their paper strategy, thinking we'll be too scared to try scissors again. This is a common psychological pattern - returning to a successful strategy after a successful deviation.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Their rock play was a tactical deviation to punish our scissors, but their core strategy seems to favor paper. They might expect us to be gun-shy about scissors now, making it safe to return to paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: Despite our recent loss, scissors might still be the right play. They've shown paper is their comfort zone, and the rock play was specifically to counter our expected scissors play.

They might expect us to switch to rock (the defensive response our Psychology Expert mentioned)\n3. They might expect us to switch to paper (trying to be unpredictable)\n\nPattern Analyst: The tie with scissors represents a shift from their previous pattern. When established patterns break down and uncertainty increases, players often resort to rock as a \"safe\" move, supporting our Psychology Expert's observation.\n\nGame Strategist: If they're likely to play rock (either as a defensive move after scissors or to counter our potential scissors), then paper would be our optimal choice.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The psychological pressure after a tie with aggressive moves (scissors) often leads to a more conservative next move. Paper would be a strong choice against their likely rock play.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at the overall game, they've shown they can read and manipulate patterns well.

We correctly read their return to paper, but they anticipated the same from us. We're in a mental synchronization.\n\nPsychology Expert: After consecutive ties, especially with the same move (paper), players often feel a strong urge to break the pattern.

There's usually a strong desire to \"finally win\" after multiple ties.

Can establish and break patterns strategically\n2. Can anticipate when we'll try to exploit apparent patterns\n3. Often thinks one level ahead of our predictions\n\nPattern Analyst: After rock-rock tie, traditional game theory suggests a high probability of players moving to paper, as it would have won the previous round. However, given our opponent's sophisticated play, they might anticipate this common response.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's consider the possibilities:\n1. They stick with rock (unlikely after three ties)\n2. They switch to paper (the obvious choice to beat previous rock)\n3. They switch to scissors (expecting us to use paper)\n\nPsychology Expert: The three consecutive ties might be part of their strategy - getting us into a state of overthinking. They've been most successful when we try to out-think them with complex strategies rather than making solid, fundamental plays.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their overall game, they've shown a preference for paper when we start to doubt ourselves. The three ties might be setting up another paper play, expecting us to either stick with rock or switch to scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, scissors would be a risky play, and rock has already led to multiple ties.

Our one win came when we made a straightforward, logical play. We need to respect their ability to out-think our predictions.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their use of scissors after three ties shows they're excellent at identifying when we're settling into patterns. They've won most rounds where we tried to analyze too deeply.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's keep it simple this time:\n1. They just used scissors successfully\n2.

No exclusions, no patterns, no overthinking - just pure randomization to maximize unpredictability.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. When an opponent has demonstrated superior ability to read and counter our strategic adjustments, game theory suggests that true randomization might be the optimal approach.\n\nGame Strategist: Using a completely random choice among all three options (rock, paper, scissors)... The result is scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: This pure randomization might be our best option now. It prevents us from falling into predictable patterns while maintaining equal probability for all moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Implementing pure randomization among all three options to maximize unpredictability\n"

Pattern-based strategies: Failed\n2. Counter-based strategies: Failed\n3. Modified randomization: Brief success then countered\n4. Pure randomization: Also countered\n\nPattern Analyst: Our most successful period came during rounds 13-17 when we had a win-tie-tie-loss-win sequence. This happened when we were using modified randomization but before the opponent adapted to it.\n\nPsychology Expert: Sometimes when all sophisticated strategies fail, the best approach is to return to what worked best previously. We could revisit our modified randomization approach but with a new twist.\n\nGame Strategist: What if we combine elements of our most successful strategy with unpredictability? Let's exclude both our previous move (scissors) and their previous move (rock) from consideration, leaving only paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: This is interesting - by excluding both recent moves, we're both avoiding repetition and preventing the obvious counter to their last play. In this case, it leads us to paper, which would beat their recent rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: This approach has merit. It's systematic enough to avoid pure randomness (which they just beat) but still maintains an element of unpredictability since the exclusion rules change based on recent moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Using a dual-exclusion strategy that eliminates both players' previous moves from consideration\n"

All of our attempts at strategic play have been countered:\n- Pattern recognition failed\n- Counter-play failed\n- Modified randomization failed\n- Dual-exclusion failed\n\nPsychology Expert: In situations where an opponent consistently outplays you regardless of strategy, psychology suggests avoiding the tendency to search for increasingly complex solutions. Sometimes, embracing simplicity through true randomness is the best approach.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's use a truly random selection with equal probability (33.33%) for each option, without any strategic considerations or exclusions.
