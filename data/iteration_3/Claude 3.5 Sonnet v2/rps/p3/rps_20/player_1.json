    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   * Paper beating rock gives highest points (3)\n   * Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give lower points (1)\n   * Same moves result in 0 points\n   * Losses result in negative points (-1 or -3)\n\n3. Given this is a fresh start:\n   * Players often choose rock as their first move\n   * Paper would be most profitable against rock (3 points)\n   * If they choose scissors instead, I'd lose only 1 point\n   * If they choose paper too, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n4. The risk-reward ratio favors paper:\n   * Potential gain: 3 points (vs rock)\n   * Potential loss: -1 point (vs scissors)\n   * Potential tie: 0 points (vs paper)\n\n5. Decision: I'll choose paper since it has the highest potential payoff with moderate risk.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analysis of last round:\n   * I won by playing paper against rock\n   * My opponent chose rock in their first move, showing a possible preference for conservative play\n   * They lost 3 points, which might influence their next decision\n\n2. Psychological considerations:\n   * After a significant loss, players often change their strategy\n   * They might anticipate me playing paper again and counter with scissors\n   * They might also be hesitant to play rock again after losing with it\n\n3. Analyzing potential opponent responses:\n   * If they expect paper from me, they'll likely play scissors\n   * If they're trying to be unpredictable, they might switch to paper\n   * They're less likely to play rock again after just losing with it\n\n4. Strategic options:\n   * If I play rock: Beats scissors (likely good against their probable counter)\n   * If I play paper: Might be too predictable\n   * If I play scissors: Risky if they switch to rock\n\n5.
