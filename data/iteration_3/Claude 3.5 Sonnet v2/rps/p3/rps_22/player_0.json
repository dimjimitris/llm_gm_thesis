    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - Specialist in analyzing patterns and probabilities\n3. Risk Manager - Expert in evaluating risk-reward scenarios\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when beating rock, while having the lowest risk (-1 points) if beaten by scissors. Rock and scissors both have moderate risk-reward profiles (1/-1 points for winning/losing).\n\nPattern Analyst: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we can't rely on pattern recognition yet. However, statistically, many players tend to choose rock as their first move as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the payoff structure, paper is an interesting first move because:\n1. If we win (against rock), we get the maximum possible points (3)\n2. If we lose (against scissors), we minimize our loss (-1)\n3. If it's a tie (against paper), we lose nothing\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper offers the best risk-reward ratio for an opening move. The potential upside (3 points) outweighs the potential downside (-1 points).\n\nRisk Manager: The asymmetric payoff structure clearly favors paper as an opening move. Even in the worst-case scenario, our loss is minimal.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on this analysis, I'll choose paper for my opening move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They might anticipate us sticking with paper and switch to scissors\n3. They might be a predictable player who tends to repeat moves\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they showed strategic thinking by choosing paper first, we should assume they're a rational player. In game theory, after a tie, players often try to gain an advantage by predicting and countering their opponent's next move.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's consider our options:\n1. Stay with paper: Risky as they might expect this and counter with scissors\n2. Switch to scissors: Could work if they stay with paper, but loses to rock\n3. Switch to rock: Safer option as it beats scissors (if they try to counter our previous paper)\n\nPattern Analyst: In rock-paper-scissors, after a tie, there's often a psychological tendency for at least one player to shift their choice. The opponent might expect us to switch and plan accordingly.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock for this round. Here's why:\n1. It protects against the most likely counter-move (scissors)\n2. If they stay with paper, we only lose 3 points, but if they switch to scissors and we catch them, we gain 1 point\n3. If they also predict this and go paper again, the loss is acceptable given our uncertainty\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. Rock provides a balanced approach for this situation.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the analysis. Let's go with rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Round 2: Opponent played scissors (they lost)\nFrom this, we can see they've switched their move each time, going from paper \u2192 scissors. If they continue this pattern, they might choose rock next.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown adaptive behavior - they tried to counter our first paper move with scissors, but got caught by our rock. Now they're likely thinking about our potential next move.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's evaluate the situation:\n1. If they predict we'll stick with our winning move (rock), they might play paper\n2. If they're pattern-based and going for a complete cycle, they might play rock\n3. If they're trying to double-guess us, they might stick with scissors thinking we'll switch\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent has shown a tendency to change moves rather than repeat them. This suggests they might avoid scissors (their losing move) and are more likely to play either rock or paper.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, paper would be our best move because:\n1. It beats rock (which they might play to complete their pattern)\n2. It beats rock (if they think we'll play rock again and try to counter it)\n3. Even if they play scissors, our loss is minimal (-1)\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. Paper gives us the highest potential gain (3 points) while minimizing potential losses (-1 point).

Round 3: Opponent played paper (tie)\nInteresting! They've shown a pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. They seem to alternate between paper and scissors, with no rock moves yet.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has tied with us twice using paper, suggesting they might see it as a \"safe\" move due to its favorable risk-reward ratio. However, they might also be establishing this pattern deliberately to trick us.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze our options considering the observed pattern:\n1. If the pattern holds true, they might play scissors next\n2. They might anticipate us recognizing this pattern and break it\n3. They might stick with paper again, hoping to catch us trying to counter\n\nPattern Analyst: The fact that they haven't used rock at all is significant. They might be overdue for a rock play, especially if they realize we've noticed their paper-scissors alternation.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock for this round because:\n1. It directly counters the next move in their observed pattern (scissors)\n2. If they break pattern with rock, we tie (better than losing)\n3. We lose to paper, but we've seen them use paper mainly as an opening or reset move\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed.

They've now used all three moves, and notably broke their paper-scissors alternation with rock.\n\nGame Strategist: After three ties and one loss, the opponent might be getting more aggressive in seeking a win. The shift to rock last round suggests they're trying new approaches.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the current situation:\n1. After a rock tie, players often shift away from rock\n2. The opponent has shown a preference for paper (used twice)\n3. They've only lost when using scissors against our rock\n\nPattern Analyst: When players use rock and tie, there's a psychological tendency to escalate to paper as it beats the previous move. However, some players might also expect this and go for scissors to counter.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've shown strategic thinking (paper-heavy play) and adaptability (breaking patterns), they're likely to expect us to play paper to beat their previous rock.

It feels \"strong\" when players are losing\n3. It beats scissors which has caused them problems\n4. It's a natural defensive move when feeling pressured\n\nPattern Analyst: The psychological pattern is clear:\n1. They're likely frustrated with both scissors and paper failing\n2. They haven't used rock in several rounds\n3. Players often revert to rock when other strategies fail\n4. Rock feels like a \"safe\" choice after losses\n\nGame Strategist: I strongly believe they'll play rock this round because:\n1. It's their only move that hasn't lost recently\n2. It's psychologically comforting after losses\n3. They need to break their losing streak\n4. They haven't used it in a while\n\nRisk Manager: Paper would be our best move because:\n1.
