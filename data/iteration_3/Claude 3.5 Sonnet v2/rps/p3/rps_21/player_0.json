    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, paper also risks losing 1 point to scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they might be more likely to choose rock as it's often seen as a \"strong\" opening move by new players.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the payoff structure, choosing paper offers the best risk-reward ratio in this situation. If we win, we get 3 points; if we lose, we only lose 1 point.\n\nData Analyst: Without any previous data to analyze, we should focus on maximizing expected value based on the payoff matrix and common opening moves.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with choosing paper. The potential 3-point gain outweighs the potential 1-point loss, and it counters the common opening move of rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Concur with paper. Many players instinctively choose rock as their first move, making paper strategically advantageous.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on the higher potential reward and the tendency of players to choose rock as an opening move.\n"

This gives us some insight into their strategic thinking.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie with paper, players often try to anticipate their opponent's next move. They might expect us to switch to rock or scissors, but they could also stick with paper thinking we'll change.\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent has demonstrated they think similarly to us by choosing paper in the first round. They might try to counter what they think we'll do next.\n\nData Analyst: Let's analyze the possibilities:\n1. If they expect us to stick with paper, they might choose scissors (+1 for them)\n2. If they expect us to switch to scissors, they might choose rock (+1 for them)\n3. If they expect us to switch to rock, they might stick with paper (+3 for them)\n\nPsychology Expert: Given that both players showed similar strategic thinking in round 1, there's a good chance they'll try to be one step ahead and choose scissors to beat our potential paper.\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, we should counter their likely scissors play with rock. This would give us +1 if they choose scissors, -3 if they stick with paper, and 0 if they also choose rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with rock.

Sticking with rock would be risky (-3 points if they choose paper).\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly agree. After losing, players often try to maximize their potential gain, and paper gives them the highest possible score (+3) against rock.\n\nGame Strategist: We should switch to scissors.

However, this might be too obvious. The opponent might try to outthink this by choosing paper to beat the expected rock.\n\nGame Strategist: Our options:\n1. Choose rock: Safe against scissors repeat, but vulnerable to paper (-3)\n2. Choose paper: Wins against expected rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n3.

Stay with rock (least likely after a tie)\n2. Switch to paper to beat rock (+3)\n3. Switch to scissors hoping opponent switches to paper\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown increased strategic thinking. Given the sequence of ties, they're likely thinking:\n1. We might expect them to use paper to beat rock\n2. Therefore, they might use scissors to beat our expected paper\n3. This would be a clever double-prediction\n\nPsychology Expert: The recent string of ties suggests they're playing more confidently and thoughtfully.

Be especially motivated to win after the tie streak ended badly\n\nData Analyst: The opponent's recent sequence shows they tried scissors after three ties, suggesting they're trying to read and counter our moves, but failed.\n\nRisk Analyst: After losing with scissors, players typically:\n1. Avoid repeating scissors\n2. Often switch to rock as a \"safe\" move\n3. Sometimes choose paper hoping to get a big win (+3)\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown they can think strategically (matching our moves for ties), but just got punished for trying to be clever with scissors. They might:\n1. Return to rock as a safe choice\n2. Go for paper hoping for a big win\n3. Be less likely to use scissors after just losing with it\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their previous strategic thinking and recent loss, they're likely to choose paper because:\n1. It could give them a big win (+3) if we repeat rock\n2. It feels like a fresh strategy after losing with scissors\n3.
