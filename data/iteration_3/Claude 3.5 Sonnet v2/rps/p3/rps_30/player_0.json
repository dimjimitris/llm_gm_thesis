    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior patterns\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward trade-offs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also highest potential loss (-3). Rock and scissors have lower risk-reward profiles (\u00b11 point). Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any pattern data yet.\n\nPattern Analyzer: With no prior moves to analyze, we can't predict the opponent's tendencies. However, in many cases, 'rock' is a common first move for new players as it feels \"strong\" psychologically.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the payoff structure, I suggest we play 'paper' here. While it carries higher risk (-3 if opponent plays scissors), it also has the highest reward potential (+3 if opponent plays rock). Since rock is a common first move as noted by the Pattern Analyzer, this gives us a good risk-adjusted opportunity.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The expected value is favorable if we assume a higher probability of rock from a new player. Even if we're wrong, we only lose 1 point against scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: Confirmed. Let's proceed with paper as our opening move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

They might be expecting us to change our move this time\n3. They might stick to paper again, thinking we wouldn't expect that\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, after a tie, players often tend to shift their strategy. Since both players chose paper, there might be a psychological pressure to change moves. However, we should consider that our opponent might anticipate this and try to counter our expected move.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the scenarios:\n- If we play paper again: 0 points if they stick to paper, -1 if they switch to scissors, +3 if they switch to rock\n- If we play scissors: +1 if they stick to paper, 0 if they switch to scissors, -1 if they switch to rock\n- If we play rock: -3 if they stick to paper, +1 if they switch to scissors, 0 if they switch to rock\n\nGame Strategist: Given that scissors directly counters the previous move (paper), and has a balanced risk-reward profile (\u00b11), it seems like the most rational choice. It wins against paper if they stick to it, and if they try to counter our expected scissors with rock, we only lose 1 point.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Scissors is the logical counter to paper, and even if they anticipate this and play rock, our maximum loss is minimal.\n\nRisk Manager: The risk-reward profile of scissors looks optimal here.

Second round: both scissors\nThis suggests either:\na) They might be using a similar strategic thinking process\nb) They could be deliberately mirroring our moves\nc) It could just be coincidence\n\nGame Strategist: The fact that they've matched us twice makes this a fascinating psychological game. They might:\n1. Expect us to go rock (as it beats the previous scissors play)\n2. Try to break the mirroring pattern\n3. Continue mirroring if they somehow know our moves\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the current situation:\n- Both players have shown willingness to change moves (paper \u2192 scissors)\n- No points scored yet by either player\n- The obvious move would be rock to beat the previous scissors\n- But if they're thinking the same way, we might tie again\n\nPattern Analyzer: If they're using similar logic, they might also conclude that rock is the \"obvious\" next move. We could try to get ahead of this thinking.\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, I suggest we play paper. Here's why:\n1. If they play the \"obvious\" rock, we win big (+3)\n2. If they try to be clever and play scissors again, we only lose 1 point\n3. If they try to counter our expected rock with paper, we tie again\n\nRisk Manager: I agree.

Using a more sophisticated strategy than we thought\n3. Getting lucky with their choices\n\nRisk Manager: Our current total is -1 points. We need to be careful but also look for opportunities to score. The opponent has shown they're willing to use scissors, which is a more aggressive move.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they just won with scissors, psychology suggests they might:\n1. Stick with the winning move (scissors)\n2. Anticipate us playing rock to counter their scissors\n3. Switch to paper to counter our expected rock\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent has shown adaptability and good prediction skills. We need to break their rhythm.\n\nRisk Manager: I suggest we play rock for these reasons:\n1. If they get overconfident and repeat scissors, we win (+1)\n2.

The opponent has just lost with scissors, and they might:\n1. Finally abandon scissors after losing with it\n2. Stubbornly return to scissors thinking we won't expect it again\n3. Predict we'll play rock again and counter with paper\n\nRisk Manager: Our last rock play worked well, bringing us back to even. However, repeating rock is risky as it's likely to be expected and countered with paper (-3 points).\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent's heavy use of scissors (3 out of 4 rounds) is significant. This might be their comfort move, but they've now lost with it and might adapt.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest we play scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they switch to paper (trying to beat our expected rock), we win (+1)\n2. If they play rock (trying to beat our potential scissors), we lose but only by -1\n3.

Round 5: both scissors (tie)\nCurrent total: 0 points\nKey observation: The opponent has now played scissors in FOUR out of five rounds! This is a very strong pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: This is remarkable. The opponent's heavy reliance on scissors suggests either:\n1. A strong psychological preference for scissors\n2. A limited strategic approach\n3. An attempt to lull us into a trap\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent's scissors-heavy strategy presents an obvious opportunity to play rock, but we need to consider:\n1. This might be too obvious\n2. They might finally break their scissors pattern\n3. The -3 penalty if they switch to paper\n\nPattern Analyzer: Despite these concerns, we can't ignore that they've played scissors 80% of the time. Even after losing with scissors in round 4, they returned to it in round 5.\n\nGame Strategist: Psychology suggests that after so many scissors plays, they MUST realize they need to change strategy. However, their behavior suggests they're either not very strategic or extremely committed to their approach.\n\nRisk Manager: Given their persistent behavior and our analysis, I recommend we play rock again:\n1. The opponent has shown a strong commitment to scissors even after losing\n2. If they finally switch to paper, we lose 3 points, but this risk is worth taking given their strong historical pattern\n3. If they play scissors again (which they've done repeatedly), we gain 1 point\n4. If they play rock, we tie\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed.

After losing twice to rock, basic game theory suggests they MUST change their strategy. However, they've shown an extraordinary commitment to scissors despite previous losses.\n\nRisk Manager: We're finally in a positive position (+1 points). Our choices are:\n1. Play rock again: Could win another +1, but seems too obvious now\n2. Play paper: Risky -1 loss if they stick to scissors, but +3 if they finally switch to rock\n3. Play scissors: Safe against their scissors pattern (tie), wins against paper\n\nPattern Analyzer: Despite their scissors fixation, losing twice in a row to rock should force a change. Their behavior has defied conventional strategy, but everyone has a breaking point.\n\nGame Strategist: I believe they will finally abandon scissors after two consecutive losses to rock. They're most likely to switch to paper to counter our successful rock strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, I recommend scissors:\n1.

They might expect us to switch to paper to beat their rock.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their learning curve, they're likely thinking more strategically now.

They've just lost with paper after winning big with it. Psychology suggests they'll want to counter our successful scissors play.\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend paper for these reasons:\n1. Beats rock if they make the obvious counter to our scissors (+3)\n2. If they play scissors, we lose only 1 point\n3. If they somehow stick with paper, we tie\n4.

After a paper-paper tie, traditional thinking suggests:\n1. Many players would switch to scissors\n2. But both players know this\n3.

They might:\n1. Play rock to beat our expected scissors\n2. Stay with paper thinking we'll overthink\n3. Play scissors themselves to try to tie if we do the same\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend staying with paper for these reasons:\n1. If they overthink and play scissors expecting us to stay with paper, we lose only 1 point\n2. If they play rock expecting our scissors, we win big (+3)\n3. If they also stick with paper, we tie\n4. Sometimes the unexpected play is to not change at all\n5. They've shown a tendency to match our moves when uncertain\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed.

Round 13: both paper (tie)\nCurrent total: 0 points\nCritical observation: We've now had THREE consecutive paper-paper ties! This is a significant pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: This triple paper tie situation is psychologically intense:\n1. Both players have repeatedly chosen not to break the paper pattern\n2. Both players are likely feeling strong pressure to switch\n3. The situation has become a complex mind game\n4. First player to switch could either win big or lose big\n\nRisk Manager: We're still at 0 points, but this triple paper standoff creates unique dynamics:\n1. The obvious move is scissors to break the paper chain\n2. But it's so obvious that both players might avoid it\n3. Rock becomes tempting to counter the obvious scissors\n4. But paper would then win big against rock\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent has demonstrated:\n- Ability to maintain patterns (early scissors phase)\n- Ability to break patterns strategically\n- Willingness to match our moves in uncertain situations\n- Good prediction skills\n\nGame Strategist: In this psychologically charged moment, I recommend scissors because:\n1. Three paper ties is unprecedented in our match - this pattern MUST break\n2. The tension to switch is at its peak\n3. Even if they predict our scissors, their best response (rock) would only cost us 1 point\n4. If they play paper a fourth time, we win\n5. If they also choose scissors, we tie and reset the game state\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. The psychological pressure to break three consecutive paper ties is immense. While they could counter with rock, the -1 point risk is acceptable given:\n- The potential +1 gain if they play paper again\n- The likelihood that this pattern must break\n- The relatively small downside if we're wrong\n\nPattern Analyzer: This is the moment to break the pattern.
