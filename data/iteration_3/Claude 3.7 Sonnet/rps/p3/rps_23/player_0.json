Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Now I need to reassess my strategy based on this new information.\n3. The fact that they chose paper in the first round gives me some insight into their thinking.\n4. Players often shift their strategy after a tie. Common patterns include:\n   - Sticking with the same move, thinking the opponent will change\n   - Moving to the option that would beat their previous move (in this case, scissors)\n   - Moving to the option that would have lost to their previous move (in this case, rock)\n5. Since we both played paper, they might anticipate I'll play scissors next to beat their paper.\n6. If they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock to counter.\n7. Therefore, if I play paper again, I could beat their potential rock move for 3 points.\n8. However, if they stick with paper or switch to scissors, paper would be a poor choice.\n9. Given that scissors beats paper (which we both played last round), and many players don't repeat the same move twice, scissors seems like a reasonable choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I've now won twenty-five rounds in a row, which confirms the opponent is following a completely predictable pattern with absolutely no adaptation.\n\n3. The opponent has consistently cycled through: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   This pattern has been maintained perfectly throughout the entire game.\n\n4. If they continue this unchanging pattern, they will play rock next.\n\n5. Despite losing twenty-five consecutive rounds, they've shown no deviation from their pattern, suggesting they:\n   - Are definitely following a predetermined sequence regardless of outcome\n   - Will almost certainly continue their pattern for this round as well\n\n6. Given their perfect adherence to the pattern through twenty-five straight losses, it's virtually certain they'll play rock next.\n\n7. If they play rock and I play paper, I would win 3 points.\n   If they play scissors and I play rock, I would win 1 point.\n   If they play paper and I play scissors, I would win 1 point.\n\n8. Paper would be the optimal choice if they stick to their pattern and play rock, which seems guaranteed given their unwavering adherence to the cycle through twenty-five consecutive losses.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"
