I'm playing against a fresh player, which means there's no prior history to analyze for patterns.\n2. The payoff structure is asymmetric: paper beating rock gives 3 points, while the other winning combinations only give 1 point.\n3. Since paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), it might be tempting to play paper.\n4. However, if my opponent anticipates this reasoning, they might play scissors to counter.\n5. In the absence of prior information, the standard game theory solution for one-shot rock-paper-scissors is to randomize equally among all three options.\n6. Given the asymmetric rewards, there's a slight incentive to favor paper, but this creates vulnerability to scissors.\n7. For a first move without prior information, I should make an unpredictable choice that doesn't reveal a pattern.\n8. Rock is a solid opening move that protects against scissors, though vulnerable to the high-reward paper play.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock as my first move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Since paper beats rock for the highest reward (3 points), my opponent has an incentive to switch to paper.\n4. If I predict they'll switch to paper, scissors would be my optimal response.\n5. However, if they anticipate this thinking, they might choose rock instead.\n6. This is the classic rock-paper-scissors mind game - trying to be one step ahead.\n7. Given that the previous round was rock vs rock, and considering the higher payoff for paper against rock, there's a reasonable chance my opponent will switch to paper.\n8.
