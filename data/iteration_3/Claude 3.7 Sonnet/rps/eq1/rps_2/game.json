My opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. I've lost several consecutive rounds now, suggesting my opponent might be successfully predicting my moves or using an effective strategy against me.\n\n4. Looking at their last three moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, they appear to be following the classic rotation pattern again.\n\n5. If they continue this pattern, their next move would be rock.\n\n6. However, they've been winning consistently, so they might stick with paper since it just worked for them.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might anticipate I'll play scissors to counter their paper, and thus play rock.\n\n8. Given their demonstrated adaptability and success, I need to make a move that has good chances against their most likely choices.\n\n9. If they follow the rotation and play rock, scissors would lose.\n   If they stick with paper, scissors would win.\n   If they anticipate scissors from me and play rock, scissors would lose.\n\n10. Two of these scenarios suggest scissors would lose. I need to break my losing streak with a different approach.\n\n11. If they play rock (rotation or anticipating scissors), paper would win.\n   If they play paper again, paper would tie.\n   If they play scissors (anticipating paper from me), paper would lose.\n\n12. Given these scenarios and my need to break the losing streak, playing paper gives me better chances overall.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I just broke my losing streak by correctly predicting they would play rock.\n\n4. Looking at their last four moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, they've been following the classic rotation pattern recently.\n\n5. If they continue this pattern, their next move would be scissors.\n\n6. However, they just lost a round, which might cause them to change their strategy.\n\n7. After a loss, players often switch strategies or try to counter what they think their opponent will play next.\n\n8. They might anticipate I'll play paper again since it just worked, and thus play scissors to counter.\n\n9. Alternatively, they might break their pattern entirely and play something unexpected.\n\n10. Given their demonstrated pattern behavior throughout much of the game, there's still a reasonable chance they'll play scissors next (either following their pattern or anticipating my paper).\n\n11. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n\n12. This is a calculated risk based on their pattern history and psychological factors after a loss.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"
