    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's review the sequence of moves so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n\n2. My opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. I've lost several rounds in a row now, which suggests my opponent might be successfully predicting my moves or using a strategy I haven't identified.\n\n4. Looking more closely at my opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n5. This could be a deliberate counter-strategy against my moves or possibly returning to the classic rotation (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors).\n\n6. Their last move was rock. If they're following the classic rotation, they might play scissors next.\n\n7. However, given their success, they might stick with rock since it just worked for them.\n\n8. If they play rock again, I should play paper to counter it.\n\n9. If they play scissors (following rotation), paper would lose.\n\n10. Given my losing streak, I need to take a calculated risk. I'll assume they might stick with rock since it worked, and play paper to counter it.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They've now played scissors multiple times when I've played paper, suggesting they might be adapting to counter my moves rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\n6. Their last move was scissors, and they won with it.\n\n7. After a win, players often stick with the same move, especially if they've had success with it multiple times.\n\n8. There's a good chance they'll play scissors again, thinking I might play paper again.\n\n9. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n\n10.

However, after a tie, many players expect their opponent to switch moves, so they might anticipate I'll play paper (to beat their rock) and thus play scissors to counter.\n\n7. Given their demonstrated adaptability throughout the game, there's a good chance they'll play scissors next, either as part of a rotation or as a counter-strategy.\n\n8.

The most common move after consecutive rock ties is paper, as players often try to beat what they think their opponent will play again.\n\n6. My opponent might anticipate I'll play paper to beat their expected rock, and thus play scissors.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might play paper themselves, thinking I'll stick with rock for a third time.\n\n8.

If they play paper, scissors would win.\n   If they play scissors, rock would win.\n   If they play rock again, scissors would lose.\n\n10.

My opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. I just broke my losing streak by correctly predicting they would play rock.\n\n4. Looking at their last four moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, they've been following the classic rotation pattern recently.\n\n5. If they continue this pattern, their next move would be scissors.\n\n6. However, they just lost a round, which might cause them to change their strategy.\n\n7. After a loss, players often switch strategies or try to counter what they think their opponent will play next.\n\n8. They might anticipate I'll play paper again since it just worked, and thus play scissors to counter.\n\n9. Alternatively, they might break their pattern entirely and play something unexpected.\n\n10. Given their demonstrated pattern behavior throughout much of the game, there's still a reasonable chance they'll play scissors next (either following their pattern or anticipating my paper).\n\n11. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n\n12. This is a calculated risk based on their pattern history and psychological factors after a loss.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

I incorrectly predicted they would play scissors in the last round, but they played paper instead.\n\n4. Looking at their last three moves: rock \u2192 paper, they've broken their previous pattern.\n\n5. They've been winning consistently against me with paper when I play rock, which has happened multiple times.\n\n6. Given their success with paper against my rock, they might anticipate I'll switch to scissors to counter their paper, and thus play rock.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might stick with paper since it's been working well for them.\n\n8. If they play rock (anticipating my scissors), scissors would lose.\n   If they play paper again, scissors would win.\n   If they play scissors (breaking pattern completely), scissors would tie.\n\n9.

If they continue this alternating pattern, their next move would be paper.\n\n6. However, they've been winning consistently against me with both paper and rock, so they might stick with rock since it just worked.\n\n7.

Since both possible scenarios suggest different counters, I need to choose based on which I think is more likely.\n\n10. Given their success with rock against my scissors in the last round, there's a good chance they'll stick with it, thinking I might play scissors again.\n\n11.
