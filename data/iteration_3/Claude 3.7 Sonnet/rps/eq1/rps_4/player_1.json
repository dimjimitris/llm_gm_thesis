    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My opponent successfully broke my winning streak by playing paper against my rock.\n3. This suggests they either anticipated my move correctly or changed their strategy effectively.\n4. After my loss, there's a psychological tendency for me to change my move.\n5. My opponent might expect me to switch from rock (which lost) to either paper or scissors.\n6. Since I lost to paper, they might expect me to choose scissors next (to beat their paper).\n7. If they anticipate me playing scissors, they would likely choose rock.\n8. However, they might also stick with paper after their success, following the winner's tendency to repeat successful moves.\n9. Given that they just won with paper, there's a possibility they'll play paper again, thinking I might choose rock again or switch to scissors.\n10. If they play paper again, my best counter would be scissors.\n11. If they play rock (expecting my scissors), my best counter would be paper.\n12. Considering these factors and the psychological dynamics at play, I believe they're more likely to switch to rock, expecting me to play scissors to counter their previous paper.\n13. To counter their anticipated rock move, I'll choose paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper\n\n[move] paper\n"

Given our recent history and the psychological dynamics at play, I believe they're most likely to choose scissors to counter my previous winning paper move.\n10.
