    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which means they likely don't have established patterns yet.\n2. In the absence of prior information, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) have equal expected value.\n3. However, research has shown that in the first round, rock is the most common choice among new players, followed by scissors, then paper.\n4. If I assume my opponent follows this tendency, the optimal counter would be paper (beats rock).\n5. But my opponent might be anticipating this and choose scissors to counter paper.\n6. Since I have no specific information about this player's tendencies, I should avoid being too predictable.\n7. I'll choose rock for this first round, as it has a slight advantage against scissors which is often a popular first choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

Option a) seems most likely - players often counter the previous winning move.\n5. If they play paper to counter my previous rock, I should play scissors to beat their paper.\n6.

My opponent has returned to playing paper, which has been successful for them against me.\n   - They've beaten my rock with paper in rounds 16, 17, and now 20\n   - They seem to be anticipating when I'll play rock\n\n4. After winning with paper against my rock, my opponent might:\n   a) Stay with paper since it's been working well against me\n   b) Switch to rock anticipating I might play scissors\n   c) Switch to scissors thinking I'll play paper to counter their paper\n\n5. Given their success with paper against me and the tendency of players to stick with winning moves, option a) seems quite likely - they might play paper again.\n\n6. However, they've also shown ability to adapt, so option c) is also possible - they might anticipate me playing paper and counter with scissors.\n\n7. Between these possibilities, I think they're most likely to stick with paper given how successful it's been against me.\n\n8. If they're likely to play paper again, my best counter is scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has abandoned their successful paper strategy and switched to scissors, resulting in a tie.\n   - They seem to be anticipating my moves with increasing accuracy\n   - They switched from paper (which was working) to scissors, correctly guessing my move\n\n4. After tying with scissors against my scissors, my opponent might:\n   a) Switch to rock to beat scissors\n   b) Stay with scissors thinking I might switch to paper\n   c) Switch to paper thinking I might switch to rock\n\n5. Given their recent success at anticipating my moves, and the natural tendency to play rock after a scissors tie, option a) seems most likely - they'll play rock expecting me to play scissors again or anticipating I'll switch to a predictable option.\n\n6. If they're likely to play rock, my best counter is paper.\n\n7. However, they may be expecting this exact reasoning from me. To introduce unpredictability, I'll play scissors again, which would:\n   - Lose to rock if they follow the expected pattern\n   - Tie with scissors if they also try to be unpredictable\n   - Beat paper if they try to counter my expected paper play\n\n8.

I'm on a 3-game winning streak:\n   - Round 25: Paper beats Rock\n   - Round 26: Rock beats Scissors\n   - Round 27: Scissors beats Paper\n\n4. My opponent's recent sequence has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They've been cycling through the three options in reverse order\n   - Each move has lost to my counter\n\n5. After losing with paper against my scissors, my opponent might:\n   a) Switch to rock to beat my scissors if they think I'll play scissors again\n   b) Switch to scissors if they think I'll switch to paper\n   c) Stay with paper if they think I'll switch to rock\n\n6. Given that they just lost with paper and have been cycling through moves, option a) seems most likely - they'll play rock to counter my potential repeated scissors play.\n\n7. If they're likely to play rock, my best counter is paper.\n\n8. However, they might anticipate this reasoning and play scissors to beat my expected paper.\n\n9. Given our recent pattern where they seem to be one step behind my moves, I think rock remains their most likely choice.\n\n10. If rock is their most likely move, my best counter is paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's recent sequence has been: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They've been cycling through the three options in reverse order (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock)\n   - Each move has lost to my counter\n\n4. My recent sequence has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - I've been cycling through the three options in standard order (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper)\n   - This has perfectly countered their reverse cycle\n\n5. After losing with rock against my paper, my opponent might:\n   a) Continue their reverse cycle and play scissors next\n   b) Break the pattern and play something else to try to catch me off guard\n   c) Mirror my winning strategy and play rock (what I played when I started my winning streak)\n\n6. Given their apparent pattern and my success, option a) seems most likely - they'll continue their reverse cycle and play scissors.\n\n7. If they're likely to play scissors, my best counter is rock.\n\n8. However, they might realize I've figured out their pattern and try to break it.\n\n9. Given the clear pattern that's emerged and their consecutive losses, I think they're most likely to either continue their pattern or try something completely different. Between these options, continuing with scissors seems slightly more likely.\n\n10. If scissors is their most likely move, my best counter is rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent sequence has been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They broke the pattern I thought they were following\n   - They've used paper successfully against my rock multiple times\n\n4. After winning with paper against my rock, my opponent might:\n   a) Stay with paper since it just worked for them\n   b) Switch to rock anticipating I might play scissors\n   c) Switch to scissors thinking I'll play paper to counter their paper\n\n5. Given their success with paper against me (winning 5 times with it), option a) seems possible - they might stick with paper.\n\n6. However, they've also shown adaptability and might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors to counter their paper. In that case, option b) - playing rock - would be their best move.\n\n7. Looking at the entire game history, they've played paper 9 times, rock 8 times, and scissors 12 times. Paper has been their most successful move against me.\n\n8. Given their recent win with paper and their overall success with it against me, I think they're slightly more likely to stick with paper than to switch.\n\n9. If they're likely to play paper again, my best counter is scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"
