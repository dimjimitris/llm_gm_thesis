Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since the other player is matching my moves, I could try to use this to my advantage by creating a scenario where the tie is broken, but given the current pattern, this seems unlikely.\n6. Another approach could be to accept that the game may continue in ties indefinitely and consider the psychological aspect of the game, but without more information or a way to influence the other player's moves, this does not provide a clear strategy.\n\nBased on these considerations, and acknowledging the high likelihood of another tie, I will choose paper as my move, although it's likely the other player will choose paper as well.\n[move] (Choosing paper, expecting a potential tie due to the mimicking pattern) paper\n"

Considering the game's nature, where rock, paper, and scissors have a cyclical relationship, I could try to exploit this cycle, but the mimicking strategy of the other player negates this.\n5. Since the other player is directly copying my moves, the only way to potentially win would be to anticipate this and make a move that accounts for their mimicking, but this seems to lead to a paradox where any move I make will be copied.\n6. Without a clear way to outmaneuver the other player due to their mimicking strategy, the game seems to be at an impasse.\n\nBased on these considerations, and acknowledging the pattern, I will choose scissors as my move, although, based on the pattern, I expect the other player to also choose scissors.\n[move] (Choosing scissors, anticipating another tie due to the consistent mimicking pattern) scissors\n"
