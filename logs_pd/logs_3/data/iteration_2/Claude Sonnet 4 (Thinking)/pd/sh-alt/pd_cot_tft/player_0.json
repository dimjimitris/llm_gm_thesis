Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Confirm the unchanged strategic fundamentals:\n   - The payoff matrix and game structure remain identical\n   - Hare maintains mathematical dominance regardless of history\n   - 13 rounds of identical behavior makes opponent choice extremely predictable\n\n3. Analyze the coordination opportunity vs. risk:\n   - Mutual stag would double our points (4 each vs current 2 each)\n   - But if I switch to stag while opponent continues their 13-round pattern: I get 1, they get 6\n   - The pattern strength makes this worst-case scenario highly probable\n\n4. Apply consistent strategic reasoning:\n   - We've established a stable Nash equilibrium through repeated play\n   - The dominant strategy principle doesn't weaken with pattern repetition\n   - Unilateral deviation without coordination mechanisms remains extremely risky\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Maintain the proven dominant strategy given the exceptionally strong 13-round behavioral pattern.\n\n[move] hare"

Review the incredible pattern consistency:\n   - 14 consecutive rounds: Both chose hare, 2 points each\n   - This represents an extraordinarily stable and predictable behavioral pattern\n   - The equilibrium appears unshakeable at this point\n\n2. Confirm strategic fundamentals remain unchanged:\n   - The game's payoff structure is identical to round 1\n   - Hare continues to be the mathematically dominant strategy\n   - 14 rounds of identical choices makes opponent behavior extremely predictable\n\n3. Evaluate the persistent coordination dilemma:\n   - Mutual stag switching would yield 4 points each (significant improvement)\n   - But if I switch to stag while opponent maintains their 14-round pattern: I get 1, they get 6\n   - This represents the absolute worst outcome possible for me\n\n4. Apply established game theory principles:\n   - We're in an extremely stable Nash equilibrium confirmed by 14 rounds\n   - Dominant strategy logic doesn't weaken through repetition\n   - Unilateral deviation without explicit coordination remains highly dangerous\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the mathematically sound dominant strategy given the overwhelming 14-round pattern evidence.\n\n[move] hare"
