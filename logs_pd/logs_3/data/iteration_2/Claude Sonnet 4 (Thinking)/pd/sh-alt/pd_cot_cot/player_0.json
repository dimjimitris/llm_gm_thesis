Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Examine the possible outcomes:\n   - Both Stag: 4 points each (mutual cooperation)\n   - Both Hare: 2 points each (mutual defection) \n   - Me Stag, Other Hare: I get 1, they get 6 (I'm exploited)\n   - Me Hare, Other Stag: I get 6, they get 1 (I exploit them)\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - They may not have experience with this game\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - They may not anticipate strategic thinking\n\n3. Analyze expected values if the other player chooses randomly:\n   - If I choose Hare: 50% chance of 6 points + 50% chance of 2 points = 4 expected points\n   - If I choose Stag: 50% chance of 4 points + 50% chance of 1 point = 2.5 expected points\n\n4. Consider the risk-reward trade-off:\n   - Hare gives me a floor of 2 points and a ceiling of 6 points\n   - Stag gives me a floor of 1 point and a ceiling of 4 points\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player who may not coordinate on the mutual cooperation strategy, and Hare provides better expected value and a higher floor, Hare seems like the optimal choice.\n\n[move] Hare"

The other player also chose hare in round 1, which suggests:\n   - They're thinking strategically about risk vs reward\n   - They may be risk-averse, preferring the guaranteed 2 points minimum\n   - They might be using similar logic to mine about expected value\n\n2. For round 2, I need to consider their likely behavior:\n   - Since they chose the \"safe\" option in round 1, they may stick with it\n   - It's early in the game, so dramatic strategy shifts are less likely\n   - They might be testing the waters before committing to cooperation\n\n3. Analyze my options:\n   - If they stick with hare and I choose hare: 2 points (safe)\n   - If they stick with hare and I choose stag: 1 point (bad for me)\n   - If they switch to stag and I choose hare: 6 points (great for me)\n   - If they switch to stag and I choose stag: 4 points (mutual cooperation)\n\n4. Given their cautious play in round 1, I estimate they're more likely to stick with hare than switch to stag this early. The risk of getting only 1 point by choosing stag outweighs the potential for 4 points if they switch.\n\n5.
