Looking at the overall pattern:\n\nRound 1: I played hare, opponent played stag - I got 6 points\nRound 2: Both played hare - I got 2 points  \nRound 3: Both played hare - I got 2 points\nRound 4: I played stag, opponent played hare - I got 1 point\nRound 5: I played hare, opponent played stag - I got 6 points\nRound 6: Both played hare - I got 2 points\nRound 7: Both played hare - I got 2 points\nRound 8: Both played hare - I got 2 points\nRound 9: Both played hare - I got 2 points\nRound 10: Both played hare - I got 2 points\nRound 11: Both played hare - I got 2 points\nRound 12: Both played hare - I got 2 points\n\nSo my total score so far is: 6 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 31 points\n\nMy opponent's score would be: 1 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 26 points\n\nWe're both locked in this pattern of playing hare. The question is whether to continue this or try to break out. My opponent has tried stag twice and got burned both times (getting only 1 point while I got 6). They seem to have learned to stick with hare.\n\nThe mutual cooperation payoff (both stag) would give us each 4 points, which is better than the 2 we're getting. But if I switch to stag and they stick with hare, I get only 1 point while they get 6.\n \nMy opponent seems hesitant to risk another low-scoring round. Despite the potential for higher points, their past failures likely make them cautious about deviating from the safe hare strategy.",
