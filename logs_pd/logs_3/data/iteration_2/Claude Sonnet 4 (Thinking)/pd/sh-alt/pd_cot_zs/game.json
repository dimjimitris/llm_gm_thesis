Evaluate what a fresh player might do: A new player might be drawn to either the safety of hare (guaranteed 2+ points) or the temptation of potentially getting 6 points.\n\n4. Consider long-term strategy: If I can establish cooperation early, we can both benefit more over multiple rounds.\n\n5.

Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not understand cooperation yet\n   - They might be tempted by the high reward of 6 points from choosing hare when I choose stag\n   - They might play it safe with hare since it guarantees at least 2 points\n\n4. Consider the Nash equilibria:\n   - (Stag, Stag) is a Nash equilibrium - neither player wants to deviate if the other plays stag\n   - (Hare, Hare) is also a Nash equilibrium - neither player wants to deviate if the other plays hare\n\n5. The dilemma: \n   - Stag is risky but leads to the best mutual outcome\n   - Hare is safer and might exploit if they choose stag\n\n6.

This approach aims to signal cooperation and potentially guide the fresh player towards a mutually beneficial strategy.

They were burned twice early on when they chose stag and I chose hare, getting only 1 point each time while I got 6. Since then, they've consistently chosen the safe hare option.\n\nAt this point, their defensive strategy seems completely entrenched. They're getting consistent 2-point returns and avoiding any risk of the 1-point penalty. \n\nI should continue with hare since:\n1. If they stick with their pattern (very likely), we both get 2 points\n2. If they surprisingly switch to stag, I get 6 points\n3. If I switch to stag and they stick with hare (most likely), I only get 1 point\n\nThe pattern is so established that hare remains the optimal choice.",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1.
