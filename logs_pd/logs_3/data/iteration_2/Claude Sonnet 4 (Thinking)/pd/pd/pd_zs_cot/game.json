I get 1 point instead of 2.\n- What's the best that could happen? We both get 4 points if they also decide to break the pattern.\n\nThe key question is: after 6 rounds of identical behavior, is there any reason to think the other player might be ready to try cooperation?\n\nGiven that they're described as a \"fresh player\" initially, they might be learning or adapting. But 6 rounds of consistent defection suggests they've settled into this strategy.\n\nThe rational choice from a game theory perspective is still defection, as it's the dominant strategy. However, there could be an argument for trying cooperation once to see if we can break out of this suboptimal equilibrium.\n\nBut the risk is high - if they continue defecting, I lose points unnecessarily.
