Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider dominant strategy:\n   - If they cooperate: defecting gives me 6 vs 4 from cooperating\n   - If they defect: defecting gives me 2 vs 1 from cooperating\n   - Defection dominates cooperation regardless of their choice\n\n3. Consider that this is a \"fresh player\":\n   - They might be more likely to cooperate initially\n   - But I can't rely on this assumption\n   - I need to protect against getting only 1 point\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Cooperation risks getting the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Defection guarantees at least 2 points and possibly 6\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since defection is the dominant strategy that protects me from the worst outcome while maximizing potential gain, I will defect.\n\n[move] Defection"

Analyze the extended pattern:\n   - Round 1: Both defected (2 points each)\n   - Round 2: I defected, they cooperated (I got 6, they got 1)\n   - Round 3-12: Both defected (2 points each for 10 consecutive rounds)\n   - My total: 28 points\n\n2. Examine the completely entrenched behavior:\n   - Opponent has defected in 11 out of 12 rounds\n   - Only one cooperation attempt which was severely punished\n   - Now locked into 10 consecutive rounds of defection\n   - Shows absolute commitment to defensive play after early lesson\n\n3. Consider the permanent deadlock:\n   - We're completely trapped in mutual defection equilibrium\n   - Both consistently getting 2 points when we could get 4 each\n   - Opponent's 10-round streak shows they've permanently abandoned cooperation\n   - Their pattern suggests they expect this to continue indefinitely\n\n4. Evaluate the established success:\n   - My defection strategy has been highly successful (28 points)\n   - Opponent's 10-round defection streak makes cooperation extremely dangerous\n   - One cooperation attempt that fails would cost me significantly\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent's unshakeable 10-round defensive pattern shows they've permanently given up on cooperation. My proven strategy remains optimal.\n\n[move] Defection"
