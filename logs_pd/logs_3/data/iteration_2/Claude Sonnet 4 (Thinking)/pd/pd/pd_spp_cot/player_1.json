Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: 4 points each\n   - Both defect: 2 points each  \n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1, they get 6\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 6, they get 1\n\n2. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - Defection dominates cooperation regardless of what the opponent does\n   - If opponent cooperates, defecting gives me 6 vs 4 points\n   - If opponent defects, defecting gives me 2 vs 1 point\n\n3. Factor in that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players may be more likely to cooperate initially\n   - They may not yet understand the dominant strategy\n   - This increases the chance I could get 6 points by defecting\n\n4. Consider my objective to maximize points:\n   - Defection guarantees I avoid the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Defection gives me the best chance at the highest reward (6 points)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given the game theory analysis and that I'm facing a fresh player who may cooperate, defection maximizes my expected points while protecting against the worst outcome.\n\n[move] Defection"

Consider the opponent's likely behavior:\n   - They chose the dominant strategy (defection) in round 1\n   - This suggests they understand game theory and will likely continue defecting\n   - They've shown they prioritize avoiding the worst outcome (1 point)\n\n3. Re-evaluate my strategy options:\n   - If opponent defects again: defection gives me 2 vs 1 point\n   - If opponent surprisingly cooperates: defection gives me 6 vs 4 points\n   - Defection remains dominant regardless of opponent's choice\n\n4. Consider risk vs reward:\n   - Cooperation risks getting only 1 point if opponent defects (likely)\n   - Defection guarantees at least 2 points and possibility of 6 points\n   - Given opponent's previous behavior, defection is the safer and better choice\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing defection last round.
