Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Mutual cooperation: 4 points each\n   - Mutual defection: 2 points each  \n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Compare my outcomes for each choice:\n   - If I cooperate: I get either 4 points (if opponent cooperates) or 1 point (if opponent defects)\n   - If I defect: I get either 6 points (if opponent cooperates) or 2 points (if opponent defects)\n\n3. Evaluate the risk vs reward:\n   - Defecting guarantees at least 2 points and offers a chance at 6 points\n   - Cooperating risks getting only 1 point, with maximum of 4 points\n\n4. Consider that defection dominates cooperation - regardless of what the opponent does, I'm better off defecting\n\n5. Since this is a fresh player, they may not have developed a strategy yet, but the rational choice is still defection to avoid the worst outcome\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I should defect to maximize my minimum guaranteed points and have a chance at the highest reward.\n\n[move] Defection"

Consider the opponent's likely response:\n   - They may switch to defection after being burned once\n   - Or they might continue cooperating if playing a forgiving strategy\n   - Or they might try to signal for mutual cooperation\n\n3. Evaluate my options given the uncertainty:\n   - If opponent switches to defection: My defection gives me 2 points vs 1 point for cooperation\n   - If opponent continues cooperating: My defection gives me 6 points vs 4 points for cooperation\n\n4. Apply game theory logic:\n   - Defection still dominates cooperation regardless of opponent's choice\n   - I'm guaranteed at least 2 points with defection\n   - I have potential for 6 points if opponent cooperates again\n\n5. Consider that even if mutual cooperation (4,4) would be better long-term, the opponent needs to demonstrate commitment to cooperation, and I should maintain the advantageous position\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection to maximize my guaranteed minimum and potential maximum points.\n\n[move] Defection"
