Also trapped in the same risk-averse thinking I am\n3. Waiting for me to make the first move toward cooperation\n\nThe key insight is that we're both consistently missing out on better outcomes. If we both cooperated, we'd get 4 points each instead of 2. But the risk is that if I cooperate and they defect, I only get 1 point.\n\nHowever, 13 rounds of identical behavior suggests this could continue indefinitely. Maybe it's time to consider that the other player might also be thinking about breaking this cycle, especially after such a long run of suboptimal outcomes.\n\nBut then again, 13 rounds of consistent defection is such strong evidence of their strategy that cooperation still seems very risky.\n\nI think I should stick with defection for now, as the pattern is so well established.",
