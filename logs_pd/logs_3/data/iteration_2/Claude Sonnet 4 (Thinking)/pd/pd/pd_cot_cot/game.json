The other player is also getting 2 points per round\n4. We're both stuck in a mutual defection pattern\n\nThis is a classic prisoner's dilemma situation where we're both stuck in a suboptimal Nash equilibrium. If we both cooperated, we'd each get 4 points per round instead of 2. But neither of us wants to risk being the \"sucker\" who cooperates while the other defects.\n\nHowever, I should consider:\n- We've established a very strong pattern of mutual defection\n- The other player might be thinking the same thing - that we're both missing out on better outcomes\n- If I try cooperation once and they defect, I only lose 1 point compared to my usual 2 (so I'd get 1 instead of 2, a loss of 1 point)\n- But if we both cooperate, I'd get 4 instead of 2 (a gain of 2 points)\n\nThe expected value calculation:\n- If I assume they have some small probability (say 10%) of also switching to cooperation, then:\n  - 10% chance we both cooperate: 4 points\n  - 90% chance they defect while I cooperate: 1 point\n  - Expected value: 0.1 * 4 + 0.9 * 1 = 0.4 + 0.9 = 1.3 points\n\nThat's still worse than the guaranteed 2 points from defection.\n\nBut what if they're thinking the same way I am? What if they're also considering that we're both trapped in a suboptimal outcome?\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. After 4 rounds of mutual defection, maybe it's worth trying to signal a willingness to cooperate. If they're rational, they might recognize that we're both stuck and might be willing to try cooperation too.\n \nThe potential upside outweighs the minimal downside. A single point loss is small compared to the possibility of gaining two additional points through mutual cooperation. This strategic gamble could break our current stalemate and lead to a more beneficial outcome for both players.",

Analyze the extensive pattern established:\n   - 15 rounds completed with 13 mutual defection outcomes\n   - 9 consecutive rounds of mutual defection\n   - Opponent has defected 14 out of 15 times (93.3% consistency)\n\n2. Confirm the opponent's unwavering commitment:\n   - Their strategy is completely predictable at this point\n   - No deviation from defection in 9 straight rounds\n   - Zero evidence of genuine cooperation interest\n\n3. Assess the mathematical reality:\n   - Defection provides guaranteed 2 points with perfect reliability\n   - Cooperation attempts have 100% exploitation rate (2/2 failed)\n   - Expected value calculation shows defection as clearly superior\n\n4. Evaluate the locked strategic equilibrium:\n   - Both players have settled into stable defensive positions\n   - The mutual defection pattern is mathematically optimal given opponent behavior\n   - No rational incentive exists to change this proven approach\n\n5. Apply the consistently successful strategy:\n   - Defection has provided reliable protection and points\n   - The pattern has proven itself over extensive iterations\n   - Maintaining this approach is the only logical choice\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the thoroughly proven optimal strategy\n\n[move] Defection",

The opponent has established they will almost always defect, and mutual defection has become the norm. \n\nAt this point, there's really no strategic reason to deviate. The opponent has shown:\n1. They exploit cooperation attempts immediately\n2. They return to defection after any brief cooperation\n3. They maintain consistent defection over long periods\n\nMy cooperation attempts have failed 100% of the time (2 out of 2), while defection guarantees 2 points every time.\n\nThe mathematical expectation strongly favors continued defection, and there's no new information suggesting the opponent will change their approach.",
