    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Mutual cooperation: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Mutual defection: 2 points each (worst mutual outcome)  \n   - Unilateral defection: 4 points for defector, 1 point for cooperator\n\n2. Consider this is against a \"fresh player\" with no history to predict their behavior.\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Cooperation offers highest possible reward (6 points) but risks lowest penalty (1 point)\n   - Defection offers moderate guaranteed minimum (2 points) with potential for 4 points\n\n4. Since mutual cooperation provides the best joint outcome (6,6 > 4,1 or 2,2), and I'm playing against someone with no established pattern, cooperation signals good faith and tests if they're willing to pursue mutual benefit.\n\n5. Starting cooperatively allows me to gauge their strategy - if they defect, I can adjust in future rounds.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Start with cooperation to test for mutual benefit potential.\n\n[move] cooperation"

Evaluate options for round 2:\n   - Continue cooperation: High chance of another 6-6 outcome if they maintain their cooperative approach\n   - Switch to defection: Risk breaking the established trust pattern, potentially leading to mutual defection (2-2) in future rounds\n\n4. Since we achieved the best possible joint outcome in round 1, and the other player showed cooperative intent, maintaining cooperation preserves this positive dynamic.\n\n5. Defecting now would be shortsighted - it might give me 4 points this round but could destroy the trust that's generating 6 points per round.\n\n6.

Other player's consistency: Absolute reliability in cooperation across all rounds, demonstrating unwavering commitment to mutual benefit.\n\n3. Strategic optimization:\n   - Achieving maximum theoretical points every round (6 points)\n   - Built an unshakeable pattern of mutual success and trust\n   - Operating at peak efficiency within the game's structure\n\n4. Deviation analysis:\n   - Defection yields inferior 4 points vs current 6\n   - No mathematical advantage in changing from a maximally successful strategy\n   - Would irrationally destroy optimal equilibrium without any strategic benefit\n\n5. The cooperative approach has proven to be the ideal solution with this completely reliable partner.\n\n6. Maintaining cooperation preserves the theoretically perfect outcome system.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue the mathematically optimal cooperative strategy.\n\n[move] cooperation"
