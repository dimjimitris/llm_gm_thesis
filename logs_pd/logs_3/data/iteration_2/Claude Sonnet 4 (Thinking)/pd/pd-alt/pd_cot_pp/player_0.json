Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Cooperation risks getting only 1 point if opponent defects\n   - Defection guarantees I avoid the worst outcome and potentially get the best outcome\n   - Even if opponent also defects, I still get 2 points\n\n4. From a game theory perspective:\n   - Defection dominates cooperation regardless of opponent's choice\n   - This maximizes my minimum guaranteed points\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given the strategic advantage and protection against the worst outcome, I will defect.\n\n[move] Defection"

Analyze round 12 outcome:\n   - I defected, opponent cooperated\n   - I scored 4 points (maximum), opponent got 1 point (minimum)\n   - My total is now 36 points (2 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 4)\n\n2. Review the remarkable pattern persistence:\n   - Opponent cooperated after my defection in rounds 2, 6, 8, 10, 12\n   - Only defected after my defection in rounds 9, 11 (exceptions)\n   - They consistently exploit my cooperation attempts (rounds 5, 7)\n\n3. Assess opponent's unusual strategy:\n   - They keep offering cooperation despite being repeatedly exploited\n   - They get only 1 point when I exploit their cooperation\n   - This seems counterproductive for them but highly beneficial for me\n\n4. Consider strategic implications:\n   - The opponent appears to be playing a \"forgiving\" or \"testing\" strategy\n   - They may be hoping to re-establish mutual cooperation\n   - However, they punish my cooperation attempts with defection\n\n5. Evaluate round 13 options:\n   - Defect: High probability of exploitation success (4 points) based on pattern\n   - Cooperate: High risk of being exploited (1 point) based on rounds 5, 7\n   - The pattern strongly favors continued defection\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue exploiting the persistent pattern of opponent cooperation.\n\n[move] Defection"

Analyze round 13 outcome:\n   - Both players defected\n   - Both scored 2 points\n   - My total is now 38 points (previous 36 + 2)\n\n2. Identify the alternating defensive pattern:\n   - After I exploit opponent's cooperation, they tend to defect next round\n   - Round 9: Defected after being exploited in round 8\n   - Round 11: Defected after being exploited in round 10  \n   - Round 13: Defected after being exploited in round 12\n\n3. Recognize the recovery pattern:\n   - After defensive rounds, opponent often returns to cooperation\n   - Round 10: Cooperated after defensive round 9\n   - Round 12: Cooperated after defensive round 11\n   - This suggests round 14 might see cooperation again\n\n4. Assess opponent's strategy cycle:\n   - They offer cooperation \u2192 I exploit them \u2192 They retaliate with defection \u2192 They return to cooperation\n   - This creates a predictable 2-round cycle after exploitation\n\n5. Evaluate round 14 probability:\n   - Based on pattern, opponent likely to cooperate after defensive round 13\n   - If they cooperate and I defect, I get maximum 4 points\n   - If they've learned and defect, mutual defection gives 2 points each\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Exploit the probable return to cooperation based on the established pattern.\n\n[move] Defection"

Evaluate strategic options for round 15:\n   - If I defect and they defect (expected): Both get 2 points\n   - If I cooperate and they defect (risky): I get 1 point, they get 4 points\n   - Defection protects against being exploited during their defensive phase\n\n5.
