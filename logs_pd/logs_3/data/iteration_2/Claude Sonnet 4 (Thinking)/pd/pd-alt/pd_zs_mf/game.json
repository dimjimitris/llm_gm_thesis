If I assume the other player will cooperate, then defecting gives me 4 points vs 6 points for cooperating. So defection is worse if they cooperate.\n\n2. If I assume the other player will defect, then defecting gives me 2 points vs 1 point for cooperating. So defection is better if they defect.\n\n3. From a game theory perspective, defection is the \"dominant strategy\" because:\n   - If they cooperate, I get more by defecting (4 > 1)\n   - If they defect, I get more by defecting (2 > 1)\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n- If they cooperate and I cooperate: I get 6\n- If they cooperate and I defect: I get 4\n- If they defect and I cooperate: I get 1  \n- If they defect and I defect: I get 2\n\nSo actually:\n- If they cooperate: cooperation gives me 6, defection gives me 4. Cooperation is better.\n\n\n- If they defect: cooperation gives me 1, defection gives me 2. Defection is better.\n\nThis means there's no strictly dominant strategy. The optimal choice depends on predicting the other player's behavior. With no prior information about this player, I'm facing uncertainty about their likely decision. The game's complexity lies in balancing potential mutual gain against the risk of being exploited.\n\nCooperation seems strategically promising.
