Consider that this is against a \"fresh player\" with no history to predict their behavior.\n\n3. Evaluate strategy options:\n   - Cooperation offers the highest mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - Defection provides insurance against being exploited, but lower payoff overall\n   - Since this appears to be an iterated game, starting cooperatively can establish a pattern of mutual benefit\n\n4. Consider that starting with cooperation signals good intentions and can lead to sustained mutual cooperation, maximizing long-term points.\n\n5. The risk of getting only 1 point is offset by the potential for establishing a cooperative relationship worth 6 points per round.\n\nFinal decision: Start with cooperation to signal cooperative intentions and aim for the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] cooperation"

The dominant strategy analysis is:\n- If opponent cooperates: I get 4 with defection vs 6 with cooperation\n\n\n- If opponent defects: I get 2 with defection vs 1 with cooperation\n\nThe strategic landscape reveals a complex risk calculation. Mutual defection has become our established pattern, with each round reinforcing a defensive stance. Past exploitation has made cooperation seem dangerous. While theoretically cooperation could yield higher points, the practical risk of being undercut makes defection the more prudent choice.",
