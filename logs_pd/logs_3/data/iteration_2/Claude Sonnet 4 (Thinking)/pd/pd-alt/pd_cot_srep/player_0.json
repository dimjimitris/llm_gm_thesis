Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Track the recent pattern:\n   - Round 10: I defected, opponent cooperated (4 points for me)\n   - Round 11: Both defected (2 points each)\n   - Round 12: I defected, opponent cooperated (4 points for me)\n\n2. Analyze their inconsistent responses to my defection:\n   - Sometimes they cooperate when I defect (giving me 4 points)\n   - Sometimes they defect when I defect (giving us both 2 points)\n   - But they ALWAYS defect when I cooperate (giving me 1 point)\n\n3. Compare potential outcomes:\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 4 points for me\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points for me\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 6 points for me (best possible)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point for me (their consistent pattern)\n\n4. Evaluate the cooperation risk:\n   - They've exploited my cooperation in rounds 3, 5, and 8\n   - Zero evidence they'll genuinely reciprocate cooperation\n   - Their history shows 100% exploitation rate when I cooperate\n\n5. Calculate expected value:\n   - Defecting: Sometimes 4 points, sometimes 2 points\n   - Cooperating: Almost certainly 1 point based on established pattern\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Despite mutual cooperation being theoretically optimal, this opponent has never failed to exploit my cooperation. I'll continue defecting for the safer expected outcome.\n\n[move] defection"

Analyze their consistent behavior:\n   - When I defect: They usually cooperate now (giving me 4 points)\n   - When I cooperate: They have NEVER failed to exploit me (100% defection rate)\n   - This creates a clear incentive structure\n\n3. Evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - They seem to be rewarding my defection with cooperation\n   - But they punish any cooperation attempt with exploitation\n   - This could be their way of maintaining control while giving me decent points\n\n4. Consider the risks of changing strategy:\n   - Continuing to defect: High probability of 4 points based on recent pattern\n   - Switching to cooperation: 100% historical exploitation rate suggests 1 point\n   - The risk-reward strongly favors continued defection\n\n5. Recognize the stable equilibrium:\n   - They appear comfortable giving me 4 points when I defect\n   - I get consistent high returns without risk of exploitation\n   - This is better than mutual defection (2 points) and avoids exploitation risk\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: This opponent consistently rewards my defection with cooperation while punishing any cooperative attempts.
