Defection gives either 4 points (if other cooperates) or 2 points (if other defects).\n\n2. Consider that this is a \"fresh player\" - they may not have an established strategy yet and could go either way.\n\n3. From a game theory perspective, defection is the dominant strategy since:\n   - If they cooperate, I get 4 points by defecting vs 6 by cooperating\n   - If they defect, I get 2 points by defecting vs 1 by cooperating\n\n4. While mutual cooperation (6,6) would be better than mutual defection (2,2), the risk of being exploited (getting only 1 point while they get 4) is significant.\n\n5. Since I want to maximize my points and this is our first interaction, the rational choice is to defect to ensure I get at least 2 points and possibly 4.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Defect\n\n[move] Defection"
