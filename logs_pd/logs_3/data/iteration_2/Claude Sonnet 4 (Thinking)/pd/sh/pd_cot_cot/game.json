I got 4 points, opponent got 1.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n- Round 1: Opponent exploited my cooperation\n- Round 2: I exploited their cooperation\n\nThis creates an interesting dynamic. The opponent might be:\n1. Playing a tit-for-tat strategy (cooperate first, then mirror my previous move)\n2. Alternating between moves\n3. Trying to establish cooperation after seeing I can also defect\n\nNow I need to think about what they might do next:\n- If they're doing tit-for-tat, they would choose hare (mirroring my previous hare)\n- If they're trying to re-establish cooperation, they might choose stag again\n- If they're alternating, they would choose hare\n\nGiven that we're both at 5 points total (1+4 for me, 4+1 for them), we're tied. \n\nThe safest play might be hare again, since:\n- If they choose hare, we both get 2 (not great but safe)\n- If they choose stag, I get 4 (very good)\n\nBut if I want to try to establish mutual cooperation for higher long-term gains:\n- If I choose stag and they choose stag, we both get 6 (best mutual outcome)\n- If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1 (bad for me)\n\nThe question is: what is the opponent likely to do? Given that they started with exploitation but then cooperated when I retaliated, they might be testing whether we can establish mutual cooperation. This could be a good time to try stag again to see if we can reach the (6,6) outcome.\n\nBut it's risky. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\n\nI'll play defensively. The opponent has shown a willingness to exploit, so I'll choose hare to protect my points. While cooperation sounds appealing, their previous behavior suggests caution is wise.
