The pattern seems to be:\n- We establish cooperation for a few rounds\n- They defect to get 4 points while I get 1\n- I retaliate with hare\n- We both get 2 points (mutual hare)\n- I offer cooperation again\n- We cooperate for a few rounds\n- They defect again\n\nThis is happening repeatedly. They seem to be following a strategy where they periodically exploit my willingness to rebuild trust.\n\nAt this point, I need to consider whether continuing to rebuild trust is worth it, or if I should shift to a more defensive strategy.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n1. Continue the cycle - retaliate with hare, then offer cooperation later\n2. Switch to always playing hare to avoid being exploited\n3. Try a different approach\n\nIf I always play hare, we both get 2 points each round, which is better than me getting 1 point when they exploit me.\n\nIf I continue the rebuild cycle, I get exploited periodically but also get periods of 6 points.\n\nLet me think about the math. In a typical cycle:\n- They defect (I get 1, they get 4)\n- I retaliate (we both get 2)\n- I cooperate (we both get 6) \n- We cooperate again (we both get 6)\n- We cooperate again (we both get 6)\n- They defect again...\n\nSo in a 5-round cycle, I might get: 1 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 21 points\nWhile if I always played hare, I'd get: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 points\n\nSo the rebuild strategy is still better for me overall, even with the exploitation.\n\nI should retaliate now to show consequences, then be ready to rebuild again.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
