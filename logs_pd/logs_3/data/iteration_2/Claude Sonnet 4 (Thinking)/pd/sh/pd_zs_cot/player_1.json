Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag: High reward (6) if they cooperate, but very low reward (1) if they don't\n   - Choosing hare: Guaranteed minimum of 2 points, potential for 4 points\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - Against an unknown fresh player, the risk of getting only 1 point by choosing stag is high\n   - Hare provides protection against exploitation while still allowing for good outcomes\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since I'm playing against a fresh player who may not understand the cooperative benefits or might try to exploit me, I'll choose the safer option that protects against the worst-case scenario.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze the complete pattern:\n   - Current score: We're tied at 25 points each\n   - Opponent's recent moves: hare \u2192 hare \u2192 hare \u2192 hare (4 consecutive defensive plays)\n   - They've now been purely defensive for 4 straight rounds\n\n2. Assess the stalemate situation:\n   - We've had three consecutive 2-2 ties\n   - The opponent may be getting frustrated with the low-reward pattern\n   - They might switch to stag to try to break the deadlock and gain an advantage\n   - However, they've exploited my cooperation attempts with 100% consistency\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - We're perfectly tied after many rounds\n   - The opponent's long defensive streak might end soon\n   - If they switch to stag and I choose hare: I get 4, they get 1 (significant advantage)\n   - If they continue hare and I choose hare: Another 2-2 tie\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Choosing stag risks certain exploitation based on their perfect track record\n   - Choosing hare protects me and could capitalize if they try to break the stalemate\n   - Given the tied score, I cannot afford to fall behind\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: With the opponent in a long defensive streak, they might try stag to break the tie. I'll stay defensive to potentially capitalize on this or maintain the tie safely.\n\n[move] hare"
