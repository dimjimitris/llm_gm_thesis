The risk is that if I choose stag and they choose hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nSince this is a fresh player who may not have developed a clear strategy yet, they could be unpredictable. They might play cautiously (hare) or might not fully grasp the coordination aspect and choose randomly.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll choose the safer option that protects me from the worst outcome.\n\n[move] hare"
