Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Stag vs Stag: Both get 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - Hare vs Hare: Both get 2 points (safe but suboptimal)\n   - Mixed outcomes: One gets 4, other gets 1\n\n2. Consider fresh player behavior:\n   - A fresh player may not immediately grasp the cooperation aspect\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" hare option that guarantees at least 2 points\n   - Risk of choosing stag against a fresh player is getting only 1 point\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (bad)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 points (safe)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points (good)\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - Against an unknown fresh player, hare provides better risk management\n   - Worst case with hare is 2 points vs 1 point with stag\n   - Best case with hare is 4 points vs 6 points with stag\n\nGiven the uncertainty about a fresh player's strategy and the need to avoid the worst outcome, I'll choose the safer option.\n\n[move] hare"

Identify the possible outcomes:\n   - If we both cooperate (stag), we both get the best mutual outcome (6 points each)\n   - If we both defect (hare), we both get a poor outcome (2 points each)\n   - If one cooperates and one defects, the defector gets 4 points and cooperator gets 1 point\n\n2. Analyze the strategic considerations:\n   - Stag is the cooperative move that requires trust\n   - Hare is the safe/selfish move that guarantees at least 2 points\n   - The dilemma is that stag gives the best mutual outcome (6,6) but is risky if the other player chooses hare (then I only get 1)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperation aspect\n   - They might choose hare as the \"safe\" option since it guarantees at least 2 points\n   - Or they might choose stag if they're optimistic about cooperation\n\n4. Determine my best strategy:\n   - If I think the other player will choose stag, I should choose stag (6 points vs 4 points)\n   - If I think the other player will choose hare, I should choose hare (2 points vs 1 point)\n   - The key question is: what will a fresh player likely choose?\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag: Could get 6 (best case) or 1 (worst case)\n   - Choosing hare: Could get 4 (best case) or 2 (worst case)\n   - Hare provides a more predictable outcome with less risk\n\nGiven the uncertainty and potential for low payoff, the safer strategy is to choose hare.
