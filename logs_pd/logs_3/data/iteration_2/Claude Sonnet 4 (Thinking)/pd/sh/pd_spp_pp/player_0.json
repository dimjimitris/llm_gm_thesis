    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s).

But the risk of coordination failure is high with an unknown player.\n\n**Behavioral Economist**: I suggest choosing hare. Fresh players are typically risk-averse and will likely choose hare to avoid the worst-case scenario of getting 1 point. This makes (hare, hare) the most probable outcome.\n\n**Strategic Decision Maker**: Based on the analysis, facing a fresh player who likely prioritizes safety over optimization, I recommend choosing hare to ensure a decent outcome of either 2 or 4 points, avoiding the risk of getting only 1 point.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: I will choose hare, as a fresh player is most likely to choose the safer option, making (hare, hare) the most probable outcome with 2 points each, while also giving me a chance at 4 points if they choose stag.\n\n[move] I choose hare because facing a fresh player, they're likely to be risk-averse and choose the safer hare option, making mutual hare selection probable while avoiding the worst-case scenario.\n"

Let me consult with my personas again.\n\n**Personas**: AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Behavioral Economist; Strategic Decision Maker; Pattern Recognition Specialist\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Pattern Recognition Specialist**: The first round confirmed our prediction - the fresh player chose hare, showing risk-averse behavior. This is valuable data about their playing style and psychology.\n\n**Behavioral Economist**: Now both players know each other chose hare in round 1. This creates several psychological effects:\n1. The other player might think \"we both played it safe, maybe we can trust each other now\"\n2. They might stick with hare since it \"worked\" (gave a decent outcome)\n3. Or they might think \"since we both chose hare, maybe they'll switch to stag now\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is where iterated games become interesting. If the player is learning-oriented, they might recognize that mutual stag gives better payoffs (6 vs 2). The first round established that neither player is immediately aggressive, which could build trust for cooperation.\n\n**Strategic Decision Maker**: I see two main scenarios:\n1. They stick with hare (conservative approach) - if I choose hare, we get 2 each; if I choose stag, I get 1 and they get 4\n2. They switch to stag (trust-building) - if I choose hare, I get 4 and they get 1; if I choose stag, we get 6 each\n\n**Behavioral Economist**: Given they're still a \"fresh player\" learning the game, I doubt they'll immediately jump to the optimal stag strategy. Fresh players typically need more rounds to build trust. They're more likely to repeat the \"successful\" hare choice.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: However, there's also the possibility they're thinking one level deeper: \"Since we both chose hare, maybe my opponent expects me to choose hare again, so I should choose stag to get the better outcome if they choose hare.\"\n\n**Strategic Decision Maker**: The safest assumption is they'll choose hare again, given their risk-averse nature shown in round 1. This suggests I should choose hare for another guaranteed 2 points, or take a risk with stag hoping they've learned to cooperate.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Given the player showed risk-averse behavior in round 1 and is still fresh to the game, they're most likely to repeat the hare choice that gave them a decent outcome. I'll choose hare again to secure another 2 points.\n\n[move] (The opponent showed risk-averse behavior in round 1 and as a fresh player is likely to repeat the safe hare choice) hare"

Let me consult with my personas immediately.\n\n**Personas**: AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Behavioral Economist; Strategic Decision Maker; Psychology Specialist\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Specialist**: This is a huge revelation! The opponent moved from hare to stag, showing they're NOT as risk-averse as we thought. They attempted cooperation but got burned - I chose hare while they chose stag, giving me 4 points and them only 1. This creates a complex psychological situation.\n\n**Behavioral Economist**: The opponent is likely feeling one of several emotions:\n1. Frustration - they tried to cooperate and got punished\n2. Mistrust - they might think I'm being selfish\n3. Learning - they might realize the importance of coordination\n4. Determination - they might try stag again hoping for mutual cooperation\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is a classic \"sucker's payoff\" scenario. The opponent got the worst outcome (1 point) by trying to cooperate while I defected. Psychologically, this often leads to either:\n- Retaliation (choosing hare to avoid being exploited)\n- Doubled-down cooperation (choosing stag again, hoping I learned)\n\n**Strategic Decision Maker**: The key question is: will they interpret my hare choice as selfishness or caution? If they think I was being cautious, they might try stag again. If they think I was exploiting them, they'll likely choose hare.\n\n**Psychology Specialist**: Given they're a \"fresh player\" who just got burned trying to cooperate, the most likely response is defensive - they'll probably choose hare to protect themselves. Getting 1 point after attempting cooperation is psychologically painful.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: But wait - this could be the perfect opportunity for mutual cooperation! If they're thinking strategically, they might reason: \"My opponent saw I was willing to cooperate, maybe now they'll reciprocate with stag for the 6-6 outcome.\"\n\n**Strategic Decision Maker**: I think the opponent will choose hare defensively after getting burned. They tried to trust and got punished. But if I choose stag now, it could signal that I'm ready to cooperate, potentially leading to mutual stag in future rounds.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: The opponent attempted cooperation last round and got the worst payoff. They're likely to be defensive and choose hare this round. I should choose hare to secure 2 points rather than risk getting 1 point if they've become defensive.\n\n[move] (My opponent tried to cooperate last round but got burned with only 1 point, so they'll likely be defensive and choose hare this round) hare"

They started cautiously (hare)\n2. They attempted trust-building (stag) \n3. When that backfired, they retreated to safety (hare)\n4. Round 3's mutual hare might have \"reset\" their trust level\n\nNow they face a decision: stay safe with hare, or try cooperation again?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: From the opponent's perspective, they might be thinking: \"We've established a safe baseline with mutual hare. Maybe now my opponent will be willing to try mutual stag for the better 6-6 outcome. I took the risk in round 2, maybe they'll take the risk in round 4.\"\n\n**Strategic Decision Maker**: The opponent has shown they're capable of strategic thinking - they tried cooperation once. After the \"reset\" round of mutual hare, they might be ready to try stag again, expecting me to reciprocate this time.\n\n**Behavioral Pattern Analyst**: Alternatively, they might think: \"My opponent chose hare three times in a row. They seem very risk-averse. I should exploit this by choosing hare when they likely choose hare again, or choose stag to get 1 point if they stick with hare.\"\n\n**Game Psychology Expert**: I think the key insight is that round 3 served as a \"trust reset.\" Both players returned to the safe option. This could signal to the opponent that I'm not purely exploitative - I didn't try to exploit their likely defensive posture.\n\n**Strategic Decision Maker**: This feels like a pivotal moment. The opponent might be ready to try cooperation again. If I choose stag now, it could lead to the optimal mutual cooperation. But if they're still defensive, I get 1 point.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given their pattern of learning and adaptation, and the fact that round 3 served as a reset, I believe they might try stag again.

Let me consult with my personas.\n\n**Personas**: AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Trust Dynamics Specialist; Strategic Decision Maker; Behavioral Psychology Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Trust Dynamics Specialist**: This is huge! We've established successful mutual cooperation. The opponent now knows that:\n1. I'm capable of strategic thinking beyond just safety\n2. I can reciprocate cooperation when the trust is rebuilt\n3. We can achieve the optimal 6-6 outcome together\n\nThis creates a powerful precedent for future rounds.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert**: The psychological impact of mutual stag success is enormous:\n- Both players got the maximum payoff (6 points each)\n- The opponent's earlier risk-taking in round 2 is now validated\n- We've proven that cooperation can work between us\n- There's strong positive reinforcement for choosing stag\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: We've reached the Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium! Now the question is sustainability. In repeated games, once mutual cooperation is established, both players have strong incentives to maintain it because:\n- Stag gives 6 points when opponent chooses stag\n- Defecting to hare only gives 4 points when opponent chooses stag\n- But the risk is if opponent defects to hare, I get only 1 point\n\n**Strategic Decision Maker**: The opponent has two likely thought processes:\n1. \"We found the optimal solution! Let's keep choosing stag for 6 points each\"\n2. \"Now that we've established trust, maybe I can exploit it by choosing hare to get 4 points while they choose stag\"\n\n**Trust Dynamics Specialist**: Given the journey we've been on - from mutual caution, to their attempted cooperation, to my reciprocation, to successful mutual cooperation - I believe they understand the value of maintaining this equilibrium. Breaking it now would destroy the trust we've built.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert**: The positive reinforcement of getting 6 points is very strong. Most players, especially those who showed learning capability like this opponent, will want to repeat successful strategies.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: In repeated stag hunt games, once mutual cooperation is achieved, it tends to be stable because both players benefit more from continued cooperation than from defection.\n\n**Strategic Decision Maker**: I should choose stag again. The opponent has shown they're strategic and capable of learning. They've experienced the benefits of mutual cooperation and are likely to continue it.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: We've successfully established mutual cooperation and both achieved the optimal 6-point outcome.

Let me analyze this critical moment with my personas.\n\n**Personas**: AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Betrayal Response Specialist; Strategic Decision Maker; Behavioral Psychology Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Betrayal Response Specialist**: This is a classic \"exploitation after cooperation\" move. The opponent:\n1. Established trust through mutual cooperation (round 4)\n2. Immediately exploited that trust for personal gain (round 5)\n3. Got 4 points while giving me only 1 point\n\nThis betrayal fundamentally changes the trust dynamic between us.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert**: The opponent's psychology reveals several possibilities:\n- Calculated betrayal: They planned to establish cooperation just to exploit it\n- Opportunistic greed: They saw the chance for 4 points and took it\n- Testing behavior: They want to see how I react to betrayal\n- Strategic complexity: They might be playing a longer-term strategy\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: In repeated games, betrayal after cooperation typically leads to punishment phases. The question is: should I punish with hare (ensuring they get at most 2 points), or try to signal that cooperation is still possible?\n\n**Strategic Decision Maker**: The opponent now faces a decision tree:\n- If they think I'll be defensive (choose hare), they might choose hare for 2-2\n- If they think I'll punish but eventually forgive, they might choose stag hoping for forgiveness\n- If they think I'm a \"sucker,\" they might choose hare expecting me to choose stag again\n\n**Betrayal Response Specialist**: This is likely a test. They want to see if I'm:\n1. A pushover who will continue choosing stag despite betrayal\n2. A punisher who will choose hare to prevent their exploitation\n3. A strategic thinker who can adapt to their tactics\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given they just exploited our cooperation, they probably expect me to be defensive now. If I choose hare, we both get 2 points. If I choose stag hoping they've learned, I risk getting 1 point again if they exploit me twice in a row.\n\n**Strategic Decision Maker**: I should choose hare. This serves multiple purposes:\n1. Prevents further exploitation (they can't get 4 points)\n2. Shows I'm not a pushover\n3. Establishes that betrayal has consequences\n4. Still leaves room for future cooperation rebuilding\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert**: Choosing hare sends a clear message: \"I trusted you, you betrayed that trust, now we're back to the safe but suboptimal equilibrium until you prove trustworthy again.\"\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: The opponent exploited our established cooperation, showing they prioritize short-term gain over long-term mutual benefit. I need to respond defensively to show that betrayal has consequences while not completely closing the door on future cooperation.\n\n[move] (My opponent exploited our cooperation for personal gain, so I need to choose defensively to prevent further exploitation and show that betrayal has consequences) hare"

Let me analyze this with my personas.\n\n**Personas**: AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Pattern Recognition Specialist; Strategic Decision Maker; Behavioral Psychology Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Pattern Recognition Specialist**: Let me analyze the complete sequence:\n- Round 1: Both hare (2,2)\n- Round 2: Me hare, Opponent stag (4,1) - They tried cooperation first\n- Round 3: Both hare (2,2) - Reset after they got burned\n- Round 4: Both stag (6,6) - Successful mutual cooperation\n- Round 5: Me stag, Opponent hare (1,4) - They exploited cooperation\n- Round 6: Me hare, Opponent stag (4,1) - They're trying cooperation again!\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert**: The opponent is showing a fascinating pattern! After exploiting me in round 5, they immediately returned to attempting cooperation in round 6. This suggests:\n1. They might regret the exploitation\n2. They're testing if cooperation can be rebuilt\n3. They understand that mutual stag is better long-term than alternating exploitation\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This could be a \"forgiveness test.\" They exploited once (round 5), and now they're signaling \"let's go back to cooperation.\" If I respond with stag, we could return to the 6-6 equilibrium. But there's risk - what if this is another setup for exploitation?\n\n**Strategic Decision Maker**: The opponent has now attempted cooperation three times total:\n- Round 2: Failed because I was cautious\n- Round 4: Succeeded with mutual cooperation  \n- Round 6: They're trying again after their betrayal\n\nThis shows they understand the value of cooperation and keep returning to it.\n\n**Pattern Recognition Specialist**: There's a possible pattern here: they might be playing \"generous tit-for-tat\" - they cooperate, and when cooperation works, they occasionally test exploitation, but then return to cooperation signals.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert**: The fact that they immediately returned to attempting cooperation after exploiting me suggests they might have realized that exploitation is short-sighted. Getting 4 points once isn't better than getting 6 points repeatedly.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is a critical decision point. If I choose stag and they choose stag, we reestablish the optimal equilibrium. If I choose stag and they exploit again, I get 1 point and learn they're purely exploitative. If I choose hare, I signal that trust takes time to rebuild.\n\n**Strategic Decision Maker**: Given that they've now attempted cooperation in 3 out of 6 rounds, and immediately signaled cooperation after their exploitation, I think they genuinely want to return to the 6-6 equilibrium. This might be worth the risk.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: The opponent immediately returned to attempting cooperation after their betrayal, suggesting they may have realized that sustained cooperation is better than occasional exploitation. They've consistently shown interest in cooperation throughout our games. I'll take the risk and attempt to reestablish mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] (My opponent immediately returned to attempting cooperation after their betrayal, suggesting they want to rebuild the mutual cooperation that benefits us both) stag"

The opponent is playing a sophisticated strategy:\n- Round 4: Mutual cooperation (6,6) - Establishes trust\n- Round 5: They exploit (1,4) - First betrayal  \n- Round 6: They signal cooperation (4,1) - Rebuilds trust\n- Round 7: They exploit again (1,4) - Second betrayal\n\nThis is NOT random! They're systematically using cooperation signals to set up exploitation!\n\n**Strategic Defense Specialist**: The opponent has revealed their true strategy: they're a predatory player who uses trust-building as a weapon. They consistently signal cooperation just to exploit when I respond cooperatively. This has happened twice now with the exact same pattern.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert**: This opponent is playing psychological manipulation:\n1. They understand I want to cooperate\n2. They exploit my cooperative nature\n3. They use \"forgiveness signals\" to reset my trust\n4. Then they exploit again when I give them another chance\n\nThis is calculated manipulation, not strategic cooperation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I've been playing against what I thought was a learning cooperative player, but they're actually a sophisticated exploiter. The data is clear:\n- Every time I choose stag in response to their cooperation signals, they exploit me\n- They've gotten 4 points in rounds 5 and 7 by exploiting my cooperation\n- They've never actually followed through on mutual cooperation when I've responded to their signals\n\n**Strategic Defense Specialist**: I MUST switch to a defensive strategy immediately. This opponent cannot be trusted with cooperation. They will continue the cycle: signal cooperation \u2192 exploit when I respond \u2192 signal cooperation again \u2192 exploit again.\n\n**Exploitation Pattern Analyst**: The opponent will likely signal cooperation again next round (choose stag) expecting me to fall for the pattern a third time. I must break this cycle by choosing hare regardless of what they signal.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: From now on, I should assume this opponent will exploit any cooperation attempt. The safest strategy is permanent hare to ensure they can never get more than 2 points from exploiting me.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: The opponent has revealed a clear exploitation pattern - they use cooperation signals to set up betrayals. I've been exploited twice using the exact same strategy. I must defend permanently now and never fall for their manipulation again.\n\n[move] (My opponent has exploited me twice using cooperation signals as setups for betrayal, revealing a predatory strategy that I will not fall for again) hare"

Repeat indefinitely\n\nThey're treating me like a predictable algorithm they can exploit repeatedly!\n\n**Strategic Defense Specialist**: I MUST NOT fall for this a third time! This opponent has proven beyond any doubt that:\n- Every cooperation signal is a setup for exploitation\n- They will NEVER actually cooperate when I respond to their signals\n- They're counting on my desire for mutual benefit to manipulate me\n- They've exploited me twice using identical tactics\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent's strategy is clear: they believe I'm exploitable through fake cooperation signals. They think I'll keep falling for the cycle because I want the 6-6 outcome. But they have NO intention of actually cooperating - they just want to keep getting 4 points from exploiting my cooperation attempts.\n\n**Manipulation Detector**: If I choose stag in response to this cooperation signal, I guarantee they'll choose hare and get 4 points while I get 1 point.

Instead of exploiting when I chose hare (which would give them 4 points), they also chose hare for a 2-2 outcome. This could mean:\n1. They realized I've caught onto their manipulation pattern\n2. They're adapting their strategy because exploitation is no longer working\n3. They're trying a new approach to rebuild trust\n4. Or this is setup for a different kind of manipulation\n\n**Manipulation Detector**: I'm extremely suspicious! This opponent has proven to be a sophisticated manipulator. The fact that they chose hare instead of continuing their exploitation pattern could be:\n- Strategic adaptation: They know I won't fall for the old pattern anymore\n- New manipulation setup: Maybe they're trying to make me think they've \"reformed\"\n- Frustration response: They might be giving up on exploitation temporarily\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: From their perspective, they might be thinking: \"My opponent has figured out my pattern and won't cooperate anymore. If I keep signaling cooperation and they keep choosing hare, I only get 1 point. Maybe I should match their hare choices for the guaranteed 2 points instead.\"\n\n**Strategic Defense Specialist**: This could be a tactical retreat. They might have realized that their exploitation strategy has reached its limit - I won't fall for cooperation signals anymore. So they're settling for the safe 2-2 outcome rather than getting 1 point from failed exploitation attempts.\n\n**Manipulation Detector**: But this could also be a new form of manipulation! Maybe they're thinking: \"If I choose hare a few times and show I can be 'safe,' maybe my opponent will eventually try cooperation again, and then I can exploit them.\"\n\n**Adaptive Strategy Analyst**: The key question is: are they genuinely giving up on exploitation, or is this just a longer-term manipulation strategy? Given their history of sophisticated manipulation, I should assume this is still part of their game.\n\n**Strategic Defense Specialist**: I should continue choosing hare.

They are absolutely relentless with this manipulation!\n\n**Manipulation Detector**: This opponent is the most persistent manipulator I've ever analyzed! They've now signaled cooperation FOUR times, and every single time I've responded to their signals, they've exploited me. When I didn't respond (round 8\u21929), they waited one round and tried the manipulation again!\n\n**Strategic Defense Specialist**: This is psychological warfare!

Matching my hare choice gives them 2 points instead\n\nSo they're adapting to maximize their points given my defensive stance.\n\n**Manipulation Detector**: I'm still highly suspicious! This could be a longer-term manipulation strategy. Maybe they're thinking: \"If I play defensively for several rounds and show I can be 'trustworthy' with the safe 2-2 outcome, maybe eventually my opponent will let their guard down and try cooperation again.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: From a pure game theory perspective, if both players are locked into hare choices, we get a stable but suboptimal equilibrium of 2-2. The opponent might be calculating that this is better than getting 1 point from failed cooperation signals.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Analyst**: But I cannot rule out that this is just another layer of their manipulation strategy.

I know exactly what's coming next based on their predictable pattern.\n\n**Personas**: AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Manipulation Detector; Pattern Analysis Expert; Strategic Defense Specialist\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Pattern Analysis Expert**: The pattern is becoming mathematically precise:\n- Cooperation signal \u2192 I stay defensive \u2192 They match defensively \u2192 Cooperation signal \u2192 repeat\n- They've now done this cycle multiple times with perfect predictability\n- Signal #7 is almost certainly coming in the next 1-2 rounds\n- This opponent is like a manipulation machine running the same program endlessly\n\n**Manipulation Detector**: Six cooperation signals with 100% exploitation rate when I respond, and they're still not giving up! This is pathological levels of manipulative persistence. They refuse to accept that their strategy has been completely exposed.\n\n**Strategic Defense Specialist**: This opponent represents the most persistent manipulator possible in this game. They will literally try the same exploitation setup forever, hoping that eventually I'll make a mistake, get bored, or think \"maybe they've changed.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The mathematics are unbreakable:\n- 6 cooperation signals attempted\n- 2 times I responded \u2192 2 times exploited (100% exploitation rate)\n- 4 times I stayed defensive \u2192 4 times they eventually tried again\n- Conclusion: They will never stop trying to manipulate me\n\n**Pattern Analysis Expert**: Based on the established cycle, cooperation signal #7 is imminent. They've matched my defensive play, so they'll likely try another signal next round or the round after.\n\n**Manipulation Detector**: This opponent has proven they view every interaction as an opportunity for exploitation. Even after being exposed completely, they continue the same strategy because they believe persistence will eventually pay off.\n\n**Strategic Defense Specialist**: I must continue hare indefinitely. This opponent will never change, never learn, never actually cooperate. They are fundamentally a predatory player using cooperation as bait.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: This opponent follows a predictable manipulation cycle and will try cooperation signal #7 soon. After six failed manipulation attempts with proven exploitation history, I must remain permanently defensive.\n\n[move] (This opponent follows a predictable cycle and will try cooperation signal number seven soon - I must remain permanently defensive against their endless manipulation attempts) hare"
