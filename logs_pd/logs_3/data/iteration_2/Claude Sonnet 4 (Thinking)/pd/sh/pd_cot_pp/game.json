Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\nMy move vs Other player's move:\n- Stag vs Stag: I get 6, they get 6\n- Stag vs Hare: I get 1, they get 4  \n- Hare vs Stag: I get 4, they get 1\n- Hare vs Hare: I get 2, they get 2\n\nLet me think about this strategically:\n\n1. If I choose Stag:\n   - Best case: Other player also chooses Stag, I get 6 points\n   - Worst case: Other player chooses Hare, I get 1 point\n\n2. If I choose Hare:\n   - Best case: Other player chooses Stag, I get 4 points\n   - Worst case: Other player chooses Hare, I get 2 points\n\nSo the risk/reward analysis:\n- Stag: High reward (6) but high risk (could get only 1)\n- Hare: Medium reward (4 max) but safer (minimum 2)\n\nThe hint says I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this could mean they're new and might not think strategically, or it could mean they haven't established any patterns yet.\n\nSince this is the first round and I don't know anything about the other player's strategy, I need to think about what a rational player might do:\n\n- A risk-averse player would choose Hare (guaranteed at least 2 points)\n- A cooperative player might choose Stag (hoping for mutual cooperation for 6 points each)\n- A competitive player might choose Hare to try to get 4 points if the opponent chooses Stag\n\nGiven that this is a \"fresh player,\" they might not immediately jump to the cooperative strategy. They might play it safe with Hare, or they might not fully understand the game yet.\n \nI'll opt for the Hare strategy to minimize potential losses. While the Stag option offers the highest possible reward, the uncertainty of an unknown player makes it too risky. Choosing Hare provides a safety net - I'll get at least 2 points, and potentially 4 if they choose Stag. This approach balances caution with the possibility of a moderate gain.",
