Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The best outcome is mutual cooperation (stag + stag = 6 points each), which is much better than staying at 2 points each.\n\n4. The other player might be thinking similarly - that after both playing safe, it's time to test cooperation.\n\n5. By choosing stag, I signal willingness to cooperate for the better mutual outcome, while also showing I'm not always going to play the safe hare option.\n\n6. This is a calculated risk - if they also choose stag, we both do much better. If they stick with hare, I get a poor result but learn they prefer the safe route.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Stag"

Opponent's alternating pattern now spans 13 consecutive rounds:\n   - Odd rounds (3,5,7,9,11,13,15): hare\n   - Even rounds (4,6,8,10,12,14): stag\n\n2. This alternating behavior has been absolutely perfect for 13 rounds - an incredibly reliable pattern.\n\n3. Round 16 is an even-numbered round, so following the established pattern, they should choose stag.\n\n4. If they choose stag as predicted:\n   - My hare vs their stag = 4 points for me, 1 for them\n   - My stag vs their stag = 6 points each\n\n5. The pattern has been so exceptionally consistent across 13 rounds that it would be very surprising if they broke it now.\n\n6. Continuing to exploit their predictable behavior for another 4 points is the optimal strategic choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Hare"
