Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluate the strategic options:\n   - Stag offers the highest potential reward (6 points) but risks getting only 1 point\n   - Hare is safer (minimum 2 points) but caps potential at 4 points\n\n4.

Complete game analysis:\n   - Rounds 1, 4, 7: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (1 vs 4 each time) \n   - Rounds 2, 5, 8: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (4 vs 1 each time)\n   - Rounds 3, 6, 9, 10, 11: Both chose hare (2 vs 2 each time)\n   - Current totals: Both have 25 points (tied)\n\n2. Defensive equilibrium analysis:\n   - Three consecutive mutual hare rounds show we've settled into defensive play\n   - This 2-point mutual outcome is stable but suboptimal compared to 6-point cooperation\n   - Opponent maintains perfect 3/3 exploitation record when I choose stag\n\n3. Strategic stalemate assessment:\n   - Neither player is willing to risk cooperation first\n   - The mutual hare pattern could continue indefinitely\n   - Breaking it requires one player to take significant risk\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   - Stag choice: 100% historical probability of 1-point exploitation\n   - Hare choice: Guaranteed minimum 2 points, potential 4 points if they cooperate\n   - No evidence opponent will change their exploitation behavior\n\n5. Optimal strategy:\n   - Continue defensive play until opponent signals genuine cooperation\n   - Maintain the safer 2-point baseline\n   - Force them to take the cooperation risk first if they want mutual benefit\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Stay with hare to maintain the defensive equilibrium and avoid the historically guaranteed exploitation.\n\n[move] hare"
