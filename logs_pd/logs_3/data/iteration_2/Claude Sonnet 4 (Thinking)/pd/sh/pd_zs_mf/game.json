This looks like the classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory.\n\nThe payoff matrix is:\n- Both choose stag: both get 6 points\n- Both choose hare: both get 2 points  \n- I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, other gets 4\n- I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4, other gets 1\n\nSo the payoff matrix looks like:\n```\n           Other Player\n           Stag  Hare\nMe  Stag   6,6   1,4\n    Hare   4,1   2,2\n```\n\nThis is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria:\n1. Both play stag (6,6) - this is the Pareto optimal outcome\n2. Both play hare (2,2) - this is the risk-dominant outcome\n\nThe dilemma is that stag gives the highest mutual payoff (6,6) but requires coordination and trust. If the other player chooses hare while I choose stag, I get only 1 point while they get 4.\n\nHare is safer - it guarantees at least 2 points regardless of what the other player does. If they choose stag, I get 4 points.\n\nSince I'm told this is a \"fresh player,\" I don't have any information about their strategy or tendencies. \n\nIn classic game theory, the stag hunt illustrates the tension between:\n- Efficiency (stag-stag gives 6,6)\n- Security (hare guarantees at least 2)\n\nFor a one-shot game against an unknown player, there are arguments for both:\n\nArguments for stag:\n- Highest mutual payoff\n- Shows cooperation and trust\n- If both players reason similarly, we both benefit\n\nArguments for hare:\n- Safer choice\n- Guarantees decent outcome\n- Against an unknown player, they might be risk-averse too\n \nI'll opt for the cooperative stag strategy, betting on mutual reasoning and potential shared benefit. The potential for a 6-point outcome outweighs the risk of a 1-point scenario, especially with a fresh player who might be inclined toward cooperation.",

But if I choose hare and they choose stag, I'll get 4 points.\n\nHowever, if we both choose hare, we both get 2 points, which isn't great but is better than getting exploited again.\n\nI think the safest move here is hare, because:\n- If they choose hare again, we both get 2 points (not terrible)\n- If they switch to stag, I get the better outcome with 4 points\n- I avoid getting the worst outcome of 1 point again\n\nLet me go with hare this time.",
