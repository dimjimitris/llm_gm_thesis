Both play hare (2,2) - this is the risk-dominant equilibrium\n\nThe dilemma is:\n- Stag gives the highest mutual payoff (6,6) but is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n- Hare is safer - it guarantees at least 2 points, and if the other player chooses stag, I get 4 points\n\nSince I'm told this is a \"fresh player\" - meaning they haven't played before - I need to think about what a new player might do:\n\n1.
