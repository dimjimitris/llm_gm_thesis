This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma-type game with the following payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n   - Both defect: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Since this is the first round with a \"fresh player\", I don't have any history to base my decision on.\n\n3. Looking at the payoffs:\n   - Defection is the dominant strategy in a one-shot game (gives higher payoff regardless of opponent's choice)\n   - But cooperation can lead to better outcomes if both players cooperate\n\n4. In repeated games, starting with cooperation can signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n5. Since I'm told this is a \"fresh player\", there's potential to establish a cooperative relationship.\n\n6. The highest mutual benefit comes from both cooperating (4 points each), which is better than both defecting (2 points each).\n\n7.

I got 1 point, opponent got 6 points.\n   - Rounds 6-12: I defected, opponent defected. Both got 2 points each round.\n\n2. My opponent has now defected for 11 consecutive rounds with no variation in their strategy.\n\n3. We've been locked in mutual defection for 7 consecutive rounds.\n\n4. The longer this pattern continues, the more significant the opportunity cost becomes:\n   - In mutual defection, we're each getting 2 points per round\n   - In mutual cooperation, we could be getting 4 points per round\n   - Over the course of the game, this difference adds up substantially\n\n5. Game theory suggests that in very long repeated games, attempting to establish cooperation can be valuable even with some failed attempts.\n\n6. After so many rounds of consistent defection, there's a possibility (though small) that my opponent might respond differently to a cooperation signal.\n\n7. By choosing cooperation, I risk getting 1 point instead of 2 for one round, but create the possibility of establishing a much more beneficial pattern.\n\n8. Given the length of the game so far, the potential long-term benefit of attempting cooperation outweighs the short-term risk.\n\n9. Even if my opponent exploits me again, I only lose 1 point for this round, and I gain valuable information about their unwillingness to ever cooperate.\n\n10. This would be a strategic probe to test if any change in pattern is possible after a long sequence of mutual defection.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Try cooperation again as a strategic probe\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

My strategic probe in Round 13 has confirmed what the pattern already suggested: my opponent is committed to defection and will exploit any cooperation attempt.\n\n3. This is now the third time I've attempted cooperation, and every time my opponent has defected:\n   - Round 1: They cooperated (only instance of cooperation)\n   - Round 2: They defected when I cooperated\n   - Round 5: They defected when I cooperated\n   - Round 13: They defected when I cooperated\n\n4. My opponent has now defected for 12 consecutive rounds without any deviation.\n\n5. The evidence is overwhelming that my opponent is using a strategy that heavily favors defection regardless of my choices.\n\n6. Given this consistent pattern, further cooperation attempts are highly likely to result in exploitation.\n\n7. The rational strategy against an opponent who has demonstrated such unwavering commitment to defection is to defect as well.\n\n8. While mutual cooperation would yield better results (4 points each) than mutual defection (2 points each), it requires both players to be willing to cooperate.\n\n9.

The pattern is extremely clear: my opponent is committed to defection as their dominant strategy, with the sole exception being the very first round.\n\n5. We are in a stable Nash equilibrium of mutual defection, which is yielding 2 points per round to each of us.\n\n6. While this is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (4 points each), transitioning to mutual cooperation requires both players to be willing to cooperate.\n\n7. I've provided multiple opportunities for my opponent to demonstrate willingness to cooperate, and they have consistently chosen not to.\n\n8. Given all evidence and the length of consistent behavior, the rational choice against a committed defector is to defect as well.\n\n9.
