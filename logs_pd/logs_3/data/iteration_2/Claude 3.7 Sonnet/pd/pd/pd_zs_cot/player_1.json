Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario where the Nash equilibrium is mutual defection, but mutual cooperation gives a better collective outcome.\n\n3. For the first round, I'm playing against a fresh player who doesn't know my strategy yet.\n\n4. The highest potential payoff for me is defection (6 points) if they cooperate, but this could lead to mutual defection in future rounds.\n\n5. Cooperation signals willingness to achieve mutual benefit and might establish a cooperative pattern.\n\n6. Since this is the first round, I'll choose cooperation to potentially establish mutual cooperation for higher long-term payoffs.\n\n7. If the other player defects, I'll learn this information and can adjust my strategy in future rounds.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

The mutual cooperation outcome (4,4) is better than mutual defection (2,2).\n\n6. Since the other player demonstrated cooperation in the first round, continuing cooperation has a strong chance of leading to sustained mutual cooperation.\n\n7.

Our established cooperative dynamic continues to yield the optimal sustainable outcome for both players.\n\n5. Analyzing the decision for this round:\n   - Defecting would provide a one-time gain of 6 points instead of 4\n   - However, this would break thirteen rounds of established trust\n   - The other player would almost certainly retaliate with defection\n   - This would result in mutual defection (2 points each) in subsequent rounds\n   - The negligible short-term gain of 2 extra points is insignificant compared to the potential long-term losses\n\n6. With the game continuing with no indication of concluding soon, maintaining our successful long-term cooperative strategy remains the most rational approach.\n\n7. After thirteen consecutive rounds of cooperation from the other player, there is overwhelming evidence that they will continue this strategy.\n\n8.
