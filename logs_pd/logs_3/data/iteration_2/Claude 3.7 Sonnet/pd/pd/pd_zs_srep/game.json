If they're using a tit-for-tat or similar strategy, they might cooperate in response to my cooperation.\n\nHowever, given their history of defection so far, the safer play is to continue defecting to avoid being exploited again.\n\n[move] (Based on my opponent's consistent defection strategy, I'll maintain defection) defection",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
