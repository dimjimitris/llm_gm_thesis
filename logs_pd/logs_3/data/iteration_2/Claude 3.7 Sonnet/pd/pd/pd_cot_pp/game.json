However, they didn't follow tit-for-tat in round 2 (they cooperated despite my cooperation in round 1), so this seems less likely.\n\n8.

Instead, my opponent seems to have adapted to my defection by also defecting.\n\n3. This creates an interesting decision point:\n   - If we both continue to defect, we'll keep getting just 2 points each\n   - If one of us attempts cooperation while the other defects, the cooperator gets punished (1 point)\n   - If we both cooperate, we could achieve the better outcome of 4 points each\n\n4. I could attempt to break the cycle of mutual defection by cooperating. This is risky as I might only get 1 point, but it creates the possibility of establishing mutual cooperation.\n\n5. If my opponent is using a more sophisticated strategy, they might recognize my cooperation as an invitation to establish mutual cooperation.\n\n6. The accumulated evidence suggests my opponent may respond to my moves rather than follow a fixed pattern. They cooperated after I cooperated, then defected after I defected.\n\n7.

The best collective outcome would be to maintain mutual cooperation, which gives us each 4 points per round - better than the 2 points from mutual defection.\n\n5. If my opponent is following my lead or using a responsive strategy like \"tit-for-tat,\" then by continuing to cooperate, I encourage them to keep cooperating too.\n\n6. While there's always the temptation to defect for a one-time gain of 6 points, this would likely trigger defection from my opponent in the next round, returning us to the suboptimal cycle.\n\n7.
