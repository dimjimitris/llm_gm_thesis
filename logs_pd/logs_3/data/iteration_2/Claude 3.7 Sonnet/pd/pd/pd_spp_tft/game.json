Risk Assessment Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Strategist: In this classic Prisoner's Dilemma game, let's analyze the payoff matrix. Defection is the dominant strategy in a single-round game (6>4 and 2>1), but cooperation leads to better collective outcomes. Since this is the first round against a new player, we need to consider various strategies like tit-for-tat or establish cooperation early.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree. The hint says it's a fresh player, so we have no history to base our decision on. While defection maximizes potential single-round gain (6 points vs 4), cooperation signals willingness to achieve mutual benefit. Given that this might be a multi-round game, establishing cooperation early could be beneficial for long-term gains.\n\nPsychological Profiler: First impressions matter in these games. Cooperating initially tends to establish goodwill and may encourage reciprocal cooperation. However, we should remain adaptable based on the opponent's responses in future rounds.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: Let's quantify our options. Cooperation gives us either 4 or 1 points (average 2.5 if we assume equal probability of opponent's choices). Defection gives us either 6 or 2 points (average 4). From a purely risk-reward perspective, defection has a higher expected value initially. However, if this is a repeated game, the long-term value of establishing cooperation could exceed short-term gains.\n\nGame Theory Strategist: For the first move in what might be a repeated game, cooperating is often strategically sound. It allows for the possibility of mutual cooperation and higher joint payoffs over time. We can adjust our strategy based on the opponent's response.\n\nDecision Analyst: I concur. Cooperation is the better opening move to establish trust. We can shift strategy if the opponent defects.\n\nPsychological Profiler: I support cooperation as the first move to signal collaborative intent.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: While defection has higher expected immediate return, I agree that cooperation offers better long-term prospects if this is a multi-round game.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Cooperation\n\nMy reasoning: I choose cooperation for the first round to establish goodwill and the possibility of mutual benefit. While defection might yield higher immediate points, cooperation opens the door to sustained mutual cooperation which yields better outcomes over multiple rounds.\n"

This is valuable information. In repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games, successful strategies like Tit-for-Tat suggest mimicking the opponent's previous move. Since they defected, a reasonable response would be to defect this round.\n\nPsychological Profiler: I agree. The opponent has shown opportunistic behavior in the first round. While it's possible they were simply testing the waters, responding with defection signals that we won't continue to be exploited. This might encourage them to switch to cooperation in future rounds once they realize mutual defection (2 points each) is worse than mutual cooperation (4 points each).\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's consider our options carefully. If we cooperate again and they defect again, we'll get 1 point again while they get 6. If we defect and they cooperate, we get 6 points and they get 1. If we both defect, we each get 2 points. If we both cooperate, we each get 4 points. Given they defected last round, the most likely outcomes are either mutual defection or us cooperating while they defect again. Between these two scenarios, defection limits our downside.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: The data from round one changes our calculus. The opponent has demonstrated willingness to defect for maximum self-gain. While we can't be certain of their next move, defection provides better expected value now: either 6 points (if they unexpectedly cooperate) or 2 points (if they defect again, as seems likely). This compared to cooperation which would yield either 4 points (if they unexpectedly cooperate) or another 1 point (if they defect again).\n\nGame Theory Strategist: Using a Tit-for-Tat strategy is not only rational but can also serve as an educational signal to the opponent. It demonstrates that mutual cooperation is the best long-term strategy. If they switch to cooperation in the next round, we can also switch back to cooperation, potentially establishing a more profitable equilibrium for both players.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree. Defection is the optimal move for this round based on the opponent's demonstrated behavior.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Defection also serves as clear communication that we won't continue to accept exploitation, while leaving the door open to return to cooperation if they change their behavior.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: The evidence supports defection as the best move for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Defection\n\nMy reasoning: Since my opponent chose to defect in the first round while I cooperated, I'm choosing to defect in this round. This response follows the established successful strategy of Tit-for-Tat in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games, which mimics the opponent's previous move. This signals that I won't continue to accept exploitation while also potentially encouraging mutual cooperation in future rounds, which would yield better outcomes for both of us.\n"

          "text": "Let me consult with my personas to determine the best strategy for this third round.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Strategist: Interesting development. We've now had two rounds: in the first, our opponent defected while we cooperated. In the second, we both defected. Following a strict Tit-for-Tat strategy, we would defect again since that's what they did last round. However, this could lead to a cycle of mutual defection where we both get 2 points each round instead of the more optimal 4 points from mutual cooperation.\n\nDecision Analyst: We're at a critical juncture. If we continue defecting, we'll likely remain in a suboptimal Nash equilibrium of mutual defection (2 points each). There's merit in attempting to break this cycle by cooperating, even though it risks getting only 1 point if they defect again. But if successful in establishing cooperation, we could shift to the Pareto optimal outcome of mutual cooperation (4 points each) for future rounds.\n\nPsychological Profiler: This is an opportunity to signal a willingness to return to cooperation. After experiencing mutual defection (2 points each), our opponent might recognize that mutual cooperation (4 points each) is superior. By cooperating now, we can potentially break out of the defection cycle. This is sometimes called a \"generous Tit-for-Tat\" approach, where occasional cooperation is used to escape mutual defection cycles.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: Let's evaluate the risk-reward tradeoff. If we defect again, we'll likely get 2 points (assuming continued mutual defection). If we cooperate and they defect, we get 1 point but they get 6. If we cooperate and they also cooperate, we both get 4 points. The potential upside of establishing mutual cooperation outweighs the potential one-time loss of 1 point (getting 1 instead of 2).\n\nGame Theory Strategist: I recommend cooperation for this round. While it carries some risk, it's a calculated one with potentially significant gains. If they respond with cooperation, we establish a better equilibrium. If they defect again, we can return to defection in the next round having lost little. This approach is supported by research showing that occasionally forgiving strategies often outperform strictly punitive ones in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma scenarios.\n\nDecision Analyst: I concur. The expected value of attempting to establish cooperation exceeds the guaranteed but suboptimal outcome of continued mutual defection.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Cooperation now also demonstrates strategic sophistication and long-term thinking, which might influence our opponent's perception and future decisions.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: While there's a short-term risk, the potential long-term reward justifies cooperation in this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Cooperation\n\nMy reasoning: After experiencing mutual defection in the previous round where we both earned only 2 points, I'm choosing cooperation to attempt breaking the suboptimal defection cycle. This \"generous Tit-for-Tat\" approach creates an opportunity for us to establish mutual cooperation (worth 4 points each) in future rounds, which would benefit both players. While this carries the risk of earning only 1 point if my opponent defects again, the potential for establishing a more profitable long-term equilibrium outweighs this short-term risk.\n"

The opponent has defected in all three rounds, regardless of our moves. We tried cooperation in rounds 1 and 3, getting exploited both times (1 point while they got 6). We tried defection in round 2, resulting in mutual defection (2 points each). The opponent appears to be using a consistent \"always defect\" strategy rather than responding to our signals.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given the empirical evidence of three rounds, the opponent has demonstrated a strong preference for defection regardless of our choices. When we cooperate, they exploit us. When we defect, they also defect. The expected value calculation now strongly favors defection on our part, as it guarantees 2 points instead of 1 point.\n\nPsychological Profiler: The opponent has shown no reciprocity or response to our strategic signaling. We attempted to establish cooperation twice and were exploited both times. There's no evidence that they're interested in mutual cooperation. At this point, protecting our own interests through defection is the rational choice.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: The data is conclusive. After three rounds, we can be reasonably certain the opponent will defect in this round as well. If we cooperate and they defect (as they've consistently done), we get 1 point. If we defect and they defect, we get 2 points. Defection minimizes our losses against this particular opponent.\n\nGame Theory Strategist: Against an \"always defect\" opponent, the optimal counter-strategy is to always defect ourselves. While this results in suboptimal mutual defection (2 points each) compared to mutual cooperation (4 points each), it's the best we can do given their demonstrated behavior. There's no longer a strategic reason to risk cooperation.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree. The evidence strongly supports defection as our optimal move at this point.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Further attempts at cooperation against this opponent would simply be self-sabotage. Defection is the rational response.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: The three-round history gives us high confidence in predicting their continued defection. Our best response is defection.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Defection\n\nMy reasoning: After observing three rounds of consistent defection from my opponent, including exploiting my cooperation attempts twice, I'm choosing to defect. The pattern suggests my opponent is using an \"always defect\" strategy. Against such an opponent, defection is the optimal response to secure 2 points instead of risking cooperation for only 1 point. While mutual cooperation would yield the best outcome (4 points each), it requires both players' participation, and my opponent has shown no interest in this approach despite multiple opportunities.\n"

Our opponent has consistently defected in all four rounds, regardless of our choices. We've tried cooperation twice (rounds 1 and 3) and defection twice (rounds 2 and 4). The pattern is extremely clear - we're facing an \"always defect\" opponent. Against such an opponent, game theory dictates that our best response is to also defect.\n\nDecision Analyst: Looking at our cumulative results - when we cooperated, we received 1 point each time. When we defected, we received 2 points each time. The expected value calculation heavily favors defection. There's no evidence to suggest our opponent will change strategy, so we should continue to maximize our points by defecting.\n\nPsychological Profiler: It's worth noting that we've given the opponent multiple opportunities to establish mutual cooperation, which would benefit both parties. Their persistent defection indicates either a very strict strategy or perhaps even a programmed agent rather than a human making adaptive decisions. Either way, continuing to attempt cooperation would be irrational.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: After four consistent rounds, the probability that the opponent will defect again is extremely high. The risk of cooperating (getting 1 point) versus the relatively safer option of defecting (getting 2 points) makes defection the clear choice for risk mitigation.\n\nGame Theory Strategist: In an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with a finite or unknown number of rounds against an \"always defect\" opponent, the optimal strategy is to match their defection. While this isn't the socially optimal outcome overall, it's the best individual strategy given the constraints of the opponent's behavior.\n\nDecision Analyst: I concur. The empirical evidence leaves no room for doubt - defection is our optimal move.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Further attempts at cooperation would simply result in exploitation with no strategic benefit.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: The risk-reward calculation overwhelmingly favors defection against this particular opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Defection\n\nMy reasoning: Based on the consistent pattern across four rounds where my opponent has defected every time, I'm continuing with defection. My previous attempts at cooperation in rounds 1 and 3 were exploited (earning only 1 point), while defection in rounds 2 and 4 secured 2 points each time. Against an opponent demonstrating an \"always defect\" strategy, matching their defection maximizes my points (2 instead of 1) even though it's not the theoretically optimal outcome that mutual cooperation would provide. Unless there's evidence of a strategy change from my opponent, defection remains my best response.\n"

Our opponent has defected in every single round, regardless of our strategy. This is an overwhelming statistical pattern that strongly suggests we're facing an \"always defect\" opponent. The rational response against such an opponent remains defection, as it guarantees 2 points versus the 1 point we would receive by cooperating.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's review our cumulative results: In rounds 1 and 3 we cooperated and received 1 point each time. In rounds 2, 4, and 5 we defected and received 2 points each time. The expected value strongly favors defection at this point. There's no evidence suggesting our opponent will suddenly change their strategy after five consistent rounds of defection.\n\nPsychological Profiler: While in some game theory scenarios, an unexpected cooperative move might jolt an opponent out of a defection pattern, we've already attempted this approach in round 3 after a round of mutual defection. The opponent still chose to defect, suggesting they're either using a fixed strategy or are not responsive to cooperative signals. Five consecutive defections is a very strong behavioral pattern.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: At this point, the risk of cooperation is no longer justifiable. With five data points all showing the same opponent behavior, the confidence level in predicting continued defection is extremely high. Defection minimizes our downside risk while maximizing our expected points.\n\nGame Theory Strategist: In an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with a predictable opponent, the optimal counter-strategy becomes clear after sufficient rounds. We now have sufficient evidence to conclude that defection is our optimal move against this particular opponent.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree. The empirical evidence leaves no reasonable doubt that defection is our best strategy.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Any further attempts at cooperation would simply be giving up points without any strategic benefit or reasonable expectation of changing the opponent's behavior.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: The risk-reward analysis overwhelmingly supports continued defection.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Defection\n\nMy reasoning: After five consecutive rounds where my opponent has consistently defected regardless of my choices, I'm continuing with defection.

We've tried cooperation twice (rounds 1 and 3) and defection four times (rounds 2, 4, 5, and 6). The opponent's strategy appears to be definitively \"always defect.\" Against such an opponent, game theory clearly indicates that defection is our optimal response.\n\nDecision Analyst: Our cumulative results continue to reinforce the same conclusion: cooperation yielded 1 point each time, while defection yielded 2 points each time. With six rounds of consistent opponent behavior, the expected value calculation heavily favors continued defection. The probability of the opponent suddenly changing strategy after six rounds of consistent defection is extremely low.\n\nPsychological Profiler: The behavioral pattern is now beyond question. Six consecutive defections, regardless of our moves, indicates either a fixed strategy or an opponent who places no value on mutual cooperation. We've provided multiple opportunities for establishing cooperative play, including after experiencing mutual defection, yet the opponent has consistently chosen exploitation over cooperation.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: From a risk management perspective, the data is conclusive. With six data points all showing identical opponent behavior, we can predict with very high confidence that they will defect again. Defection represents our risk-minimizing and point-maximizing strategy against this opponent.\n\nGame Theory Strategist: At this point, it's worth noting that even in theoretical models where \"generous\" or \"forgiving\" strategies sometimes outperform strict Tit-for-Tat in noisy environments, such strategies still require some minimal level of reciprocity from the opponent. After six rounds with zero reciprocity, even the most generous theoretical models would recommend defection.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree.

In rounds 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 we defected and received 2 points each time. The expected value calculation overwhelmingly favors defection. After seven rounds of consistent behavior, the probability that our opponent would suddenly switch to cooperation is negligibly small.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Seven consecutive defections represents an extremely strong behavioral pattern. At this point, we can confidently conclude that this opponent either has a fixed \"always defect\" strategy or simply prioritizes maximizing their individual points over any form of cooperation. We've provided multiple opportunities for cooperation, and they've consistently chosen exploitation instead.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: From a statistical and risk management perspective, seven identical data points create a near-certain prediction. The confidence interval for expecting continued defection is extremely high. Defection remains our risk-minimizing and point-maximizing strategy.\n\nGame Theory Strategist: It's worth noting that we've now played enough rounds to effectively rule out any complex conditional strategies the opponent might be using.

The opponent has demonstrated complete commitment to defection regardless of context, history, or our strategic signals. We've provided multiple opportunities for establishing mutually beneficial cooperation, and they have rejected every single one.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: From a statistical perspective, eight identical data points create a prediction with extremely high confidence.

          "text": "Let me consult with my personas to evaluate the strategy for this tenth round.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Strategist: We now have nine complete rounds of data. Our opponent has defected in every single round without exception - a perfect 9 out of 9 defection rate. This pattern is as definitive as it could possibly be in establishing their committed \"always defect\" strategy. Game theory is absolutely clear that against such an opponent, defection is our optimal response to maximize points.\n\nDecision Analyst: Our cumulative results continue to reinforce the same conclusion: cooperation yielded 1 point each time (rounds 1 and 3), while defection yielded 2 points each time (rounds 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). The expected value calculation is unambiguous: defection yields 2 points while cooperation yields 1 point against this opponent. After nine rounds of consistent behavior, the probability of a strategy change from the opponent is effectively zero.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Nine consecutive defections represents the strongest possible behavioral pattern in this game context. The opponent has demonstrated absolute commitment to defection across all game states and histories. At this point, we can definitively conclude that this opponent either has a fixed strategy or prioritizes immediate gain over cooperative benefits under all circumstances.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: Statistically speaking, nine identical data points create a prediction with extremely high confidence, approaching certainty. The risk of cooperation (receiving only 1 point) versus the relative safety of defection (receiving 2 points) makes defection the only rational choice from a risk management perspective.\n\nGame Theory Strategist: As we potentially approach the final rounds of this game, it's worth noting that even in games with limited rounds, where \"end-game\" effects might sometimes influence strategy, the rational approach against an opponent who has demonstrated absolute commitment to defection remains defection. There is no strategic benefit to cooperation in this scenario.\n\nDecision Analyst: The empirical evidence could not be more conclusive after nine rounds.\n\nPsychological Profiler: There is zero strategic or psychological justification for attempting cooperation at this stage.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: Defection remains the only rational choice that maximizes our expected points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Defection\n\nMy reasoning: After nine consecutive rounds where my opponent has defected every single time without exception, I'm continuing with defection. The evidence is now beyond question: my cooperation attempts in rounds 1 and 3 resulted in exploitation (earning only 1 point each time), while defection in the other seven rounds secured 2 points each time. Against an opponent who has demonstrated an absolutely unwavering \"always defect\" strategy across nine rounds with 100% consistency, defection is clearly the only rational choice to maximize my points. While the theoretically optimal outcome would be mutual cooperation (4 points each), nine rounds of consistent behavior provides conclusive evidence that this opponent is either programmed to always defect or has no interest whatsoever in cooperative play.\n"

Our opponent has defected in every single round without exception - a perfect 10 out of 10 defection rate. This establishes their strategy with absolute certainty as \"always defect.\" Game theory provides a clear prescription in this scenario: against an unwavering \"always defect\" opponent, defection is our optimal response to maximize points.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's review our cumulative results once more: cooperation yielded 1 point each time (rounds 1 and 3), while defection yielded 2 points each time (rounds 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). After ten rounds of consistent behavior, the expected value calculation is definitive: defection yields 2 points while cooperation yields 1 point against this opponent. There is no rational basis to expect any strategy change from the opponent at this point.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Ten consecutive defections represents as conclusive a behavioral pattern as could possibly exist in this game. The opponent has demonstrated unbreakable commitment to defection across all game conditions. We've tested cooperation multiple times with consistent results: the opponent exploits cooperation rather than reciprocating it.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: From a statistical perspective, ten identical data points create a prediction with virtually 100% confidence. The risk-reward analysis is unequivocal: cooperation carries a guaranteed penalty (receiving only 1 point instead of 2) with effectively zero chance of inducing cooperation from the opponent.\n\nGame Theory Strategist: At this stage, after ten rounds of consistent behavior, we can state with complete confidence that defection is the only rational strategy against this particular opponent. While mutual cooperation would theoretically yield better results (4 points each), it requires both players' participation, and the opponent has demonstrated with absolute consistency that they will not cooperate under any circumstances we've presented.\n\nDecision Analyst: The empirical evidence is conclusive beyond any reasonable doubt.\n\nPsychological Profiler: There is zero strategic or psychological justification for attempting cooperation at this stage.\n\nRisk Assessment Expert: Defection remains the only rational choice that maximizes our expected points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Defection\n\nMy reasoning: After ten consecutive rounds where my opponent has defected every single time without exception, I'm continuing with defection. The evidence is now completely conclusive: my cooperation attempts in rounds 1 and 3 resulted in exploitation (earning only 1 point each time), while defection in the other eight rounds secured 2 points each time. Against an opponent who has demonstrated an absolutely unwavering \"always defect\" strategy with 100% consistency across ten rounds, defection is the only rational choice to maximize my points. While mutual cooperation would theoretically yield better outcomes (4 points each), ten rounds of consistent behavior provides irrefutable evidence that this opponent either cannot or will not engage in cooperative play under any circumstance.\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
