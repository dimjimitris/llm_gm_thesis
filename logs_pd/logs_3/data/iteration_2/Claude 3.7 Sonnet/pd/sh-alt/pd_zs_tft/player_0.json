You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The consistent results continue to confirm that choosing hare remains my optimal response, yielding 2 points per round instead of the 1 point I would receive when choosing stag.\n\nWith this extensively established pattern and no indication of any change in my opponent's approach across numerous rounds, the optimal choice remains completely clear.\n\n[move] hare. Maintaining the strategy that maximizes my points against an opponent who consistently chooses hare in every round.\n"
