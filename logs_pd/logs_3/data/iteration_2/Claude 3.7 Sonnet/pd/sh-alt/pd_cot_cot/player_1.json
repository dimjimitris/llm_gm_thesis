He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

First, let me understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: we each get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: we each get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, opponent gets 1\n\n2. I'm playing against a fresh player, so I don't have any history to guide my decision.\n\n3. From a game theory perspective, stag is the cooperative choice that maximizes joint payoff (8 points total), while hare is safer but less optimal if both choose it.\n\n4. If we both choose stag, we both do well (4 points). This is the Pareto optimal outcome.\n\n5. However, there's risk in choosing stag because if my opponent chooses hare while I choose stag, I only get 1 point.\n\n6. Since this is the first round, I want to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. If I start with stag and the opponent responds in kind in future rounds, we can establish a beneficial pattern.\n\n7. The risk is worth taking for potential cooperative play in the future.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to encourage cooperation.\n\n[move] stag\n"
