This is a classic \"stag hunt\" game with the following payoffs:\n   - Both choose stag: We both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: We both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, opponent gets 6 points\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, opponent gets 1 point\n\n2. What's the best strategy? Let me analyze:\n   - The highest mutual benefit is when both choose stag (4 points each)\n   - The lowest risk option is hare (guaranteed at least 2 points)\n   - The highest potential gain is from choosing hare while opponent chooses stag (6 points)\n   - The worst outcome is choosing stag while opponent chooses hare (only 1 point)\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I'm playing against a fresh player:\n   - There's no history to base predictions on\n   - Choosing stag is cooperative and maximizes joint payoff\n   - But choosing stag is risky if the opponent chooses hare\n   - Choosing hare is safer but suboptimal if cooperation could be established\n\n4. In the first round, I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate, hoping to establish a pattern of mutual stag choices for maximum sustainable points.\n\n[move] stag. I'm choosing stag to establish cooperation for mutual benefit, hoping we can both earn 4 points consistently.\n"
