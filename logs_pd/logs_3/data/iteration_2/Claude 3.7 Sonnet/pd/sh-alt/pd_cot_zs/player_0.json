He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff structure. \n   - Both choose stag: both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. This is a classic coordination game similar to the Stag Hunt. The optimal cooperative outcome is for both to choose stag (4,4).\n\n3. However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\n4. Choosing hare guarantees me at least 2 points, and possibly 6 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\n5. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n6. The collectively optimal choice is stag, which gives the highest total points (8) when both players choose it.\n\n7. I'll choose stag as an initial cooperative move to potentially establish mutual trust. This signals my willingness to work toward the optimal outcome.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag\n\n[move] stag\n"

This is a positive sign - the other player also chose the cooperative strategy that maximizes joint payoff.\n\n3. Since the other player chose stag last round, they've demonstrated a willingness to cooperate rather than exploit.\n\n4. The payoff structure still remains the same, with (stag, stag) being the best joint outcome at 4 points each.\n\n5. Since we successfully coordinated on stag in the previous round, there's good reason to believe we can continue this beneficial pattern.\n\n6. There's a risk that the other player might switch to hare to try to get 6 points instead of 4, but that would be short-sighted if they're thinking about repeated interactions.\n\n7. Continuing to choose stag maintains the established cooperative norm and signals my continued intention to aim for the optimal joint outcome.\n\n8.

This extended pattern of identical choices has created an exceptionally stable and predictable cooperative relationship that has consistently benefited both players equally.\n\n3. The other player has demonstrated unwavering commitment to the cooperative strategy across all fourteen rounds, showing remarkable consistency and reliability.\n\n4. The payoff structure remains constant - mutual stag choice (4,4) continues to provide the optimal balanced outcome that maximizes joint welfare.\n\n5. After fourteen rounds of successful coordination, we have established what game theorists would consider a nearly perfect cooperative equilibrium in this repeated game.\n\n6. The consistent history suggests that both players fully understand the long-term benefits of sustained cooperation and have prioritized this over potential short-term gains from defection.\n\n7. The probability of deviation at this point would be extremely low for rational players, as it would disrupt a highly successful pattern that has generated consistent returns.\n\n8.
