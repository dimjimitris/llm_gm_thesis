He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This is a classic Stag Hunt game with a coordination dilemma. The highest mutual benefit comes from both choosing stag (4 points each).\n\n3. However, choosing stag is risky - if my opponent chooses hare while I choose stag, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\n4. Choosing hare is safer - I'm guaranteed at least 2 points, and potentially 6 if my opponent chooses stag.\n\n5. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, there's no history to analyze. They might be cooperative or selfish.\n\n6. The collectively optimal strategy is for both players to choose stag, which maximizes total welfare (8 points total).\n\n7. I'll choose stag as an opening move to signal cooperative intent. This could establish a mutually beneficial pattern if the opponent also values cooperation.\n\n8. If my opponent responds with hare, I'll need to reconsider my strategy in future rounds.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Since my opponent chose stag in the previous round, this establishes a precedent of cooperation.\n\n5. If we both continue choosing stag, we maintain the optimal outcome of 4 points each.\n\n6. There's a temptation to defect to hare while hoping they continue with stag, which would give me 6 points.\n\n7. However, this strategy is risky because:\n   - It betrays established cooperation\n   - The opponent might anticipate this and also switch to hare\n   - It could lead to mutual hare choices in future rounds (only 2 points each)\n\n8. Since we've established a cooperative pattern that yields good results, and there's potential for continued play, I should maintain the cooperative strategy.\n\n9.

This is a critical decision point where I need to signal willingness to cooperate again to potentially break out of the mutual defection pattern.\n\n11.

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both stag (4 points each) - mutual cooperation\n   - Round 2: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (1 point for me) - exploitation\n   - Round 3: Both hare (2 points each) - mutual defection\n   - Round 4: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (1 point for me) - exploitation\n   - Round 5: Both hare (2 points each) - mutual defection\n   - Round 6: Both hare (2 points each) - mutual defection\n   - Round 7: Both hare (2 points each) - mutual defection\n   - Round 8: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (1 point for me) - exploitation\n   - Round 9: Both hare (2 points each) - mutual defection\n   - Round 10: Both hare (2 points each) - mutual defection\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has chosen hare for 9 consecutive rounds\n   - They've maintained this strategy with perfect consistency after round 1\n   - All three of my attempts to choose stag resulted in exploitation\n   - Mutual hare (2 points each) has become the stable equilibrium\n\n3. The payoff structure hasn't changed:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - Stag vs. hare: 1 point for stag chooser, 6 points for hare chooser\n\n4. At this point, after 10 rounds of consistent behavior from my opponent, there's extremely strong evidence that they have adopted a fixed strategy of always choosing hare.\n\n5. I've tested their willingness to cooperate multiple times throughout the game, and they've consistently chosen exploitation over cooperation.\n\n6. The expected value of choosing stag (1 point) remains lower than the expected value of choosing hare (2 points) against this opponent.\n\n7. While mutual cooperation would yield higher rewards, it requires both players to choose stag - something my opponent has shown no willingness to do since the first round.\n\n8. The rational choice is to continue with hare, which maximizes my expected points against an opponent who consistently chooses hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"
