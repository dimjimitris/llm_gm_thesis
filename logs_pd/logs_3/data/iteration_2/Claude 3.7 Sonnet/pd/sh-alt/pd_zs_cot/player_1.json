Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each (mutual cooperation)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (mutual defection)\n   - I choose stag, other player chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6\n   - I choose hare, other player chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1\n\n2. This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare)\n   - (stag, stag) is Pareto optimal - best total outcome\n   - (hare, hare) is risk-dominant - safer but lower reward\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history:\n   - There's risk in choosing stag (could get exploited for only 1 point)\n   - But (stag, stag) yields the highest mutual benefit (4 points each)\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points\n\n4. Without knowing the other player's strategy or tendencies, I'll opt for cooperation first, hoping to establish mutual cooperation.\n   - If this were repeated play, I could adjust based on their behavior\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to aim for the optimal outcome.\n\n[move] stag\n"

This suggests the other player is willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n3. Let's analyze the strategy for this round:\n   - Since we successfully coordinated on stag last round, there's a good precedent for cooperation\n   - The other player likely saw the benefit of mutual cooperation (4 points each)\n   - Maintaining this cooperation is beneficial for both of us\n   - Deviating to hare would give me 6 points if they stay with stag, but risks breaking cooperation\n\n4. Game theory suggests that maintaining successful cooperation in repeated games is often the best strategy when both players show willingness to cooperate.\n\n5.
