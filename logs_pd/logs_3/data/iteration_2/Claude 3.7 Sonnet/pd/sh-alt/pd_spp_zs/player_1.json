Mutual cooperation (stag-stag) gives the best collective outcome, but there's risk if the other player doesn't cooperate.\n\nSince this is the first round with a fresh player, I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. Stag-stag gives us both 4 points, which is better than the 2 points we'd each get from hare-hare.\n\n[move] stag\n"
