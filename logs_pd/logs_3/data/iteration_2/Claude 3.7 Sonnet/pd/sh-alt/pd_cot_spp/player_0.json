Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: We both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: We both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. This is a classic stag hunt game with a twist - the temptation to choose hare when the other player chooses stag is strong (6 points vs 4 points for mutual stag).\n\n3. However, mutual stag cooperation (4,4) is better than mutual hare (2,2), so there's incentive to cooperate if we trust each other.\n\n4. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, there's no history to base my decision on.\n\n5. The rational choice might be to choose stag to signal cooperation, hoping the other player also chooses stag for mutual benefit (4 points each).\n\n6. However, I'm vulnerable if the other player chooses hare, as I would only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\n7. Since this is the first round and building trust could be valuable, I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag\n"

In the previous round, both the other player and I chose stag, resulting in us both getting 4 points.\n\n2. This suggests the other player was willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - Both choose stag: We both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: We both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n4. Since the other player chose stag in the previous round, there are two possibilities:\n   - They are genuinely cooperative and will choose stag again\n   - They might try to exploit my expected cooperation by choosing hare this time\n\n5. If they continue with stag and I choose stag, we both get 4 points.\n\n6. If they continue with stag and I switch to hare, I would get 6 points while they get only 1.\n\n7. However, this might damage cooperation for future rounds.\n\n8. Given that we've established a cooperative pattern, and continuing with stag offers a stable and relatively high payoff, I'll maintain cooperation.\n\n9. The risk of mutual defection (both choosing hare) would result in only 2 points each, which is worse than mutual stag.\n\n[move] stag\n"

The consistent choice of stag by the other player suggests they are likely following a cooperative strategy.\n\n4. If we both continue choosing stag, we'll both receive 4 points again, which is a favorable outcome.\n\n5. I could attempt to exploit their cooperation by choosing hare, which would give me 6 points if they stick with stag.

The continued mutual stag cooperation (4,4) is better than the potential mutual hare outcome (2,2) if cooperation breaks down.\n\n7. Since we've established a stable and mutually beneficial pattern, and there's no indication the other player will deviate, maintaining cooperation seems optimal.\n\n8.

After eleven consistent rounds, the evidence for maintained cooperation is conclusive:\n   - The other player has demonstrated extraordinary strategic consistency\n   - Their behavior suggests a firm commitment to cooperation\n   - Our mutual trust has been repeatedly validated\n   - We've established a proven, optimal equilibrium for this repeated interaction\n\n6. At this advanced stage of our repeated interaction:\n   - The probability of the other player continuing with stag approaches certainty based on past evidence\n   - The expected value of continued cooperation remains higher than defection\n   - The stability of our pattern suggests it will continue to be beneficial\n   - Any deviation would be particularly irrational and counterproductive after such an extensive history\n\n7. Game theory for indefinitely repeated games strongly supports maintaining cooperation when both players have demonstrated such consistent commitment to a mutual strategy.\n\n8.
