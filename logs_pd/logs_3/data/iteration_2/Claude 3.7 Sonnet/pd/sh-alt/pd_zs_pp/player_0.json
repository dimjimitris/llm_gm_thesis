You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

I'll be choosing my move for this stag hunt game.\n\nLooking at the payoff matrix:\n- Both choose stag: 4 points each\n- Both choose hare: 2 points each\n- One chooses stag, one chooses hare: 1 point for stag chooser, 6 points for hare chooser\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I need to consider what would be the best strategy. The stag choice offers the highest mutual benefit (4 points each) if we coordinate, but carries risk if the other player chooses hare. The hare choice guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6 points.\n\nFor the first round, I'll choose stag as it enables the best collective outcome, signaling my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing stag, hoping we can coordinate for the optimal mutual outcome of 4 points each.\n"

My opponent demonstrated they're willing to choose hare over stag, potentially prioritizing their individual gain over mutual benefit. \n\nSince they chose hare last time, I have a few options:\n1. Continue with stag, hoping they might switch to cooperation\n2. Switch to hare myself to protect against getting the lowest payoff again\n\nGiven that the opponent has already shown a preference for the safer, self-interested choice, I'll adjust my strategy.\n\n[move] hare Based on the previous round, I'm choosing hare to ensure a more reasonable outcome for myself.\n"

If they're using a simple pattern-matching strategy, they might expect me to choose stag this round. If they're trying to maximize mutual benefit after seeing we're not coordinating, they might stick with stag hoping I'll do the same.\n\nSince they chose stag in the last round after choosing hare in the first round, this could indicate they're willing to take a risk for mutual benefit. If I choose stag now, we both could get 4 points each, which is better than the 2 points each we'd get if we both chose hare.\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing stag to try achieving mutual benefit this round.\n"
