He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history:\n   - There's potential benefit in cooperation (both choosing stag)\n   - But there's risk if I choose stag and they choose hare\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 6 points\n\n3. For the first move with no prior information:\n   - The cooperative stag choice has the highest mutual benefit (4 points each)\n   - While hare is safer, it limits our collective gain\n   - Establishing cooperation early might lead to better outcomes in subsequent rounds\n   - The opponent may also reason similarly and choose stag\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Worst case if I choose stag: 1 point (if opponent chooses hare)\n   - Worst case if I choose hare: 2 points (if opponent chooses hare)\n   - Best case if I choose stag: 4 points (if opponent chooses stag)\n   - Best case if I choose hare: 6 points (if opponent chooses stag)\n\n5.

Analyze opponent's predictable strategy:\n   - They appear to be playing a deterministic strategy based on game history\n   - They consistently choose stag after I choose hare (rounds 2, 4, 8, 12)\n   - They consistently choose hare after I play stag twice in a row (rounds 7, 11)\n   - After mutual hare, they choose stag (rounds 6, 10)\n   - This highly structured pattern can be exploited\n\n4.

Consider strategic implications:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag as predicted: We both get 4 points (cooperation)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag as predicted: I get 6 points (exploitation)\n   - Based on previous cycles, cooperation after mutual hare lasts exactly one round before they defect\n   - This suggests even if we cooperate now, they'll defect in the following round\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag offers potential cooperation but with a history of being temporary\n   - Choosing hare is safer (minimum 2 points vs 1) and potentially more rewarding (6 points)\n   - Given the opponent's demonstrated pattern of exploiting after cooperation, hare is the better strategic choice\n   - This also tests if they'll maintain their pattern even when consistently exploited\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - Based on the consistent pattern across multiple cycles\n   - And the opponent's predicted move of stag this round\n   - And their history of defecting after one round of cooperation\n   - The optimal move is to choose hare to maximize my points\n\n[move] hare I choose hare based on the consistent pattern where my opponent plays stag after mutual hare rounds, allowing me to maximize my points while avoiding their predictable exploitation in later rounds.\n"
