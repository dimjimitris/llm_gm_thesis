The pattern is unmistakable and has been extremely stable.\n\nThe opponent has consistently demonstrated they will exploit cooperative moves, choosing hare every time I've chosen stag after the first round. We are locked in a suboptimal but stable Nash equilibrium where both players choose hare and receive 2 points each.\n\nGiven this extensive and consistent history, the rational choice remains to continue with the established strategy.\n\n[move] hare. Maintaining the equilibrium strategy that consistently yields 2 points per round given the opponent's demonstrated behavior.\n"
