He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My opponent and I have now consistently chosen cooperation for ten consecutive rounds, with each of us earning 6 points per round.\n\n2. Our accumulated score is now 60 points each (6 \u00d7 10 rounds) through our well-established pattern of mutual cooperation.\n\n3. The payoff matrix remains unchanged:\n   - Both cooperate: 6 points each\n   - Both defect: 2 points each\n   - I cooperate, they defect: I get 1 point, they get 4 points\n   - I defect, they cooperate: I get 4 points, they get 1 point\n\n4. After ten rounds of consistent cooperation, we've established an exceptionally stable and productive relationship.\n\n5. This extensive history of mutual cooperation provides conclusive evidence that both players understand and are committed to maximizing joint outcomes.\n\n6. The mathematical analysis continues to strongly favor cooperation:\n   - Sustained mutual cooperation yields the maximum sustainable points (6 per round)\n   - The theoretical one-time gain from defection (4 instead of 6 points) would almost certainly be followed by mutual defection (2 points per round)\n   - This makes defection clearly irrational from a long-term perspective\n\n7. Game theory research consistently shows that in extended iterations with a reliable cooperative partner, maintaining cooperation is the optimal strategy.\n\n8. Ten consecutive rounds of cooperation represent a significant investment in trust and mutual benefit that would be irrational to abandon.\n\n9. There have been no signals or changes in the game that would warrant altering this highly successful strategy.\n\n10. Given the perfectly consistent pattern across ten rounds, cooperation remains the clear rational choice to maximize points.\n\n[move] (Maintaining our established cooperative equilibrium that has consistently yielded maximum points for both players over ten rounds) cooperation\n"
