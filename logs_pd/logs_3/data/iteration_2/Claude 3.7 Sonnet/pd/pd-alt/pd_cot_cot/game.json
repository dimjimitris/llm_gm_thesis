Since this may be a multi-round game, establishing cooperation early could be beneficial for long-term gains.\n\n6. Without knowing my opponent's strategy, cooperation signals willingness to work together and might establish a cooperative pattern.\n\n7. If this were a one-shot game, game theory would suggest defection as the dominant strategy. But for repeated interactions, cooperation can be strategically superior.\n\n8.
