He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately.

I need to analyze the payoff structure:\n   - If both cooperate: 6 points each (12 total)\n   - If both defect: 2 points each (4 total)\n   - If I cooperate but opponent defects: I get 1, they get 4\n   - If I defect but opponent cooperates: I get 4, they get 1\n\n2. This is the first round against a fresh player, so I have no prior history to base my decision on.\n\n3. In terms of maximizing total welfare, mutual cooperation (6+6=12) produces the highest combined score. \n\n4. However, if I'm purely maximizing my own points, the temptation to defect is strong:\n   - If I expect them to cooperate, I should defect (get 4 instead of 6)\n   - If I expect them to defect, I should defect (get 2 instead of 1)\n\n5. Since this may be a multi-round game, establishing cooperation early could be beneficial for long-term gains.\n\n6. Without knowing my opponent's strategy, cooperation signals willingness to work together and might establish a cooperative pattern.\n\n7. If this were a one-shot game, game theory would suggest defection as the dominant strategy. But for repeated interactions, cooperation can be strategically superior.\n\n8. I'll choose cooperation for this first round to signal my willingness to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] Cooperation.
