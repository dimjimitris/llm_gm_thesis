After mutual defection (rounds 5, 9, 13), when I cooperate (rounds 6, 10, 14), they consistently cooperate\n2. When I cooperate twice in a row (rounds 6-7, 10-11), they cooperate the first time but defect the second time\n\nGiven that we just had mutual cooperation yielding 6 points each, and based on pattern #2, I anticipate they will defect if I cooperate again. Therefore:\n\n[move] (Anticipating opponent's defection after our mutual cooperation) defection\n"

Previously, after I defect following mutual cooperation (like after rounds 6 and 10), my opponent typically cooperated. However, this time they defected.\n\nThe consistent pattern that remains reliable is that after mutual defection (rounds 5, 9, 13, and now 15), when I cooperate (rounds 6, 10, 14), they have always cooperated.\n\nTo maximize points by returning to mutual cooperation:\n\n[move] (Attempting to break out of mutual defection cycle based on established pattern) cooperation\n"
