Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In this situation, cooperation could lead to the highest mutual payoff (6 points each) if they also cooperate.\n\n4. Defection provides some protection against being exploited, but limits the maximum possible points.\n\n5. Since this is the first interaction and we have no history, I'll choose cooperation as it shows good faith and can potentially establish a cooperative relationship.\n\n6. Cooperation also maximizes the total welfare (12 points total vs 8, 5, or 4 in other scenarios).\n\n7.

This suggests the other player either:\n   - Has a cooperative strategy\n   - Is willing to reciprocate cooperation\n   - Made a rational choice to maximize mutual benefit\n\n3. Since the other player cooperated in the first round, there's a good chance they might cooperate again.\n\n4.

This extensive history (12 consecutive cooperative moves) provides overwhelming statistical evidence about the other player's strategy.\n\n4. Reassessing the game dynamics at this mature stage:\n   - Our mutual cooperation continues to yield the maximum sustainable outcome (6 points each per round)\n   - This pattern has proven extremely stable over a significant number of iterations\n   - Neither player has shown any indication of deviating from this optimal strategy\n\n5. The expected value calculation continues to strongly favor cooperation:\n   - Continued cooperation: 6 points this round, with extremely high confidence of 6 points in future rounds\n   - Defection: 4 points this round (a net loss of 2 points compared to cooperation), with high risk of damaging a proven beneficial relationship\n\n6. After twelve rounds of consistent behavior, the probability that my opponent will continue cooperating approaches certainty.\n\n7. Game theory principles for extensively repeated interactions strongly support maintaining the established cooperative equilibrium.\n\n8. The cumulative advantage of our sustained cooperation (72 points each) dramatically exceeds what any other strategy would have produced.\n\n9. The evidence from our extended interaction history overwhelmingly supports continued cooperation as the rational choice.\n\n10. There remains no strategic justification to deviate from our demonstrably optimal approach.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

The other player has demonstrated an exceptional commitment to cooperation across all thirteen rounds without a single deviation.\n\n3. This extensive history of thirteen consecutive cooperative moves creates an extraordinarily strong basis for predicting continued cooperation.\n\n4. Analyzing the game at this advanced stage:\n   - Our mutual cooperation strategy has consistently delivered the maximum sustainable points possible (6 each per round)\n   - The pattern has proven remarkably stable across a significant number of iterations\n   - We've established what appears to be a permanent cooperative equilibrium\n\n5. The expected value calculation remains decisively in favor of cooperation:\n   - Continued cooperation: 6 points this round, with near certainty of continued 6 points per round based on extensive historical evidence\n   - Defection: 4 points this round (a reduction of 2 points), with high likelihood of disrupting a highly beneficial long-term arrangement\n\n6. After thirteen rounds of consistent behavior, the statistical evidence for the other player's cooperative strategy is overwhelming.\n\n7. In extensively repeated interactions like ours, game theory principles strongly support maintaining the established cooperative equilibrium that maximizes mutual benefit.\n\n8.

This extensive history of cooperation (14 consecutive cooperative moves) provides overwhelming evidence that the other player is firmly committed to a cooperative strategy.\n\n4. Analyzing the game theory implications at this highly mature stage:\n   - Our mutual cooperation continues to yield the maximum sustainable outcome (6 points each per round)\n   - The pattern has proven extremely stable over a significant number of iterations\n   - We've established a highly efficient and mutually beneficial equilibrium\n\n5.

After fourteen consistent rounds, the statistical confidence in my opponent's cooperative tendency is at its highest possible level.\n\n7.
