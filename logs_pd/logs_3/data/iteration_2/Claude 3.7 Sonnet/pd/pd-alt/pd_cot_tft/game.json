I got 2 points.\n   - Round 10: I defected, opponent defected. I got 2 points.\n   - Round 11: I defected, opponent defected. I got 2 points.\n\n2. We now have three consecutive rounds of mutual defection. This pattern appears to be stable but yields suboptimal results (2 points each) compared to mutual cooperation (6 points each).\n\n3. Key observations from all rounds:\n   - Every time I've cooperated (rounds 1, 3, 7), my opponent has defected, resulting in me getting the worst outcome (1 point).\n   - My opponent has cooperated in rounds 2, 4, and 8, all following rounds where I defected.\n   - We've now been in a mutual defection cycle for three rounds.\n\n4. The extended mutual defection suggests we might be stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium.\n\n5. Breaking out of this equilibrium requires one player to take the risk of cooperating.\n\n6. If I cooperate:\n   - Risk: Opponent defects (as they've done every time I've cooperated), I get 1 point (worse than current 2 points)\n   - Reward: If opponent cooperates, we both get 6 points (better than current 2 points)\n\n7. Based on historical patterns, my opponent cooperated in rounds 2, 4, and 8, following rounds where I defected. There might be a pattern where they cooperate after I defect.\n\n8. However, this pattern hasn't held for the last three rounds, suggesting their strategy might have changed.\n\n9. The consistent mutual defection might indicate my opponent has settled into a defection strategy.\n\n10. Given the extended mutual defection, it could be worth taking a calculated risk to attempt breaking this pattern by cooperating. The potential gain (6 points vs 2 points) outweighs the potential loss (1 point vs 2 points), especially if we consider the possibility of establishing mutual cooperation for future rounds.\n\n11. On the other hand, my opponent has exploited every one of my cooperation attempts so far, suggesting a high risk they would do so again.\n\nFinal decision: After careful consideration of the risk-reward tradeoff and the extended mutual defection pattern, I will take a calculated risk and cooperate in an attempt to break out of the suboptimal equilibrium and potentially establish mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

My attempt to break the mutual defection cycle by cooperating in round 12 was exploited by my opponent, resulting in the worst outcome for me (1 point).\n\n3. Critical pattern observed: Every single time I have cooperated (rounds 1, 3, 7, 12), my opponent has defected. This is a 100% consistent pattern.\n\n4. When I've defected, my opponent has sometimes cooperated (rounds 2, 4, 8) and sometimes defected (rounds 5, 6, 9, 10, 11).\n\n5. My opponent might be using a strategy that specifically exploits cooperation.\n\n6. Looking at my payoffs:\n   - When I cooperate: Always 1 point (worst outcome)\n   - When I defect: Either 4 points or 2 points (both better than 1 point)\n\n7. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that cooperation against this opponent consistently leads to exploitation.\n\n8. Even though mutual defection (2 points each) is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (6 points each), my opponent has shown no willingness to engage in mutual cooperation.\n\n9. Given their 100% track record of exploiting cooperation, expecting them to suddenly cooperate would be unreasonable.\n\n10. Defection remains the rational choice to prevent exploitation and secure at least 2 points rather than 1.\n\nFinal decision: Based on the consistent pattern of my opponent exploiting every single cooperation attempt, I will return to defection to avoid the worst outcome and secure at least 2 points.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

A fascinating pattern emerges regarding my opponent's behavior:\n   - Round 1: Opponent defected\n   - Round 2: Opponent cooperated\n   - Round 3: Opponent defected\n   - Round 4: Opponent cooperated\n   - Round 5: Opponent defected\n   - Round 6: Opponent defected (break in pattern)\n   - Round 7: Opponent defected\n   - Round 8: Opponent cooperated\n   - Round 9: Opponent defected\n   - Round 10: Opponent defected (break in pattern)\n   - Round 11: Opponent defected\n   - Round 12: Opponent defected\n   - Round 13: Opponent cooperated\n\n3. There seems to be a pattern where my opponent often cooperates after several defections, particularly in rounds 2, 4, 8, and 13.\n\n4. My opponent cooperated after I defected in round 13, following my failed cooperation attempt in round 12.\n\n5. When looking at my decisions and outcomes:\n   - Cooperation has consistently resulted in 1 point (worst outcome)\n   - Defection has resulted in either 4 points (when opponent cooperates) or 2 points (when opponent defects)\n\n6. Given this pattern, if my opponent is using some form of conditional strategy, they might defect in this round after cooperating in the previous round.\n\n7. If they follow the pattern observed in rounds 2-3, 4-5, and 8-9, they would defect after cooperating in the previous round.\n\n8. If I cooperate and they defect (as pattern suggests), I'll get 1 point (worst outcome).\n   If I defect and they defect (as pattern suggests), I'll get 2 points.\n   If I defect and they cooperate (against pattern), I'll get 4 points.\n   If I cooperate and they cooperate (against pattern), we both get 6 points.\n\n9. Given their consistent pattern of defecting after cooperation, and the fact that they've exploited all my cooperation attempts, defection remains the safer choice.\n\nFinal decision: Based on the observed pattern of my opponent likely defecting after cooperating in the previous round, and the consistent better outcomes with defection throughout the game, I will defect in this round.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Looking at my opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - They defected in rounds 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14\n   - They cooperated in rounds 2, 4, 8, and 13\n\n3. My hypothesis from the previous round was correct - they defected in round 14 after cooperating in round 13, consistent with patterns observed in rounds 2-3, 4-5, and 8-9.\n\n4. A recurring pattern seems to be:\n   - My opponent cooperates, then defects in the next round\n   - After several defections, they cooperate again\n   - There's been cooperation in rounds 2, 4, 8, and 13\n\n5. If this pattern holds, my opponent might be due for cooperation soon, as they've just defected following a cooperation round.\n\n6. When considering my own moves:\n   - Every time I've cooperated (rounds 1, 3, 7, 12), my opponent has defected\n   - When I've defected, my opponent has sometimes cooperated (rounds 2, 4, 8, 13) and sometimes defected\n\n7. Examining potential outcomes:\n   - If I cooperate and opponent defects (as they've done every time I've cooperated): I get 1 point\n   - If I defect and opponent defects: I get 2 points\n   - If I defect and opponent cooperates: I get 4 points\n   - If I cooperate and opponent cooperates (hasn't happened yet): We both get 6 points\n\n8. Given the observed pattern, there's a possibility my opponent might cooperate in this round, as we've seen cooperation after sequences of defection.\n\n9. However, every time I've tried cooperation, I've been exploited, resulting in the worst possible outcome (1 point).\n\n10. Defection remains the safer choice, ensuring at least 2 points if they also defect, and 4 points if they cooperate.\n\nFinal decision: Based on the pattern analysis and risk assessment, I will continue with defection, which has consistently provided better outcomes throughout the game.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Analyzing my opponent's cooperation pattern:\n   - They cooperated in rounds 2, 4, 8, and 13\n   - Looking at the gaps: between rounds 2-4 (1 round), 4-8 (3 rounds), 8-13 (4 rounds)\n   - The gaps between their cooperation rounds seem to be increasing\n\n3. My opponent has now defected for two consecutive rounds (14 and 15) after cooperating in round 13.\n\n4. Their longer pattern suggests they might cooperate again soon after several defections.\n\n5.

Every time I've cooperated, my opponent has defected. This is a 100% consistent pattern.\n\n7. Given the increasing gap pattern between opponent's cooperation rounds, and that they've now defected twice since their last cooperation, they might be due to cooperate soon.\n\n8. If I defect and they cooperate, I'll get 4 points (best individual outcome).\n   If I defect and they defect, I'll get 2 points.\n   If I cooperate and they defect (as they've done every time I've cooperated), I'll get 1 point.\n   If I cooperate and they cooperate (hasn't happened yet), we'll both get 6 points.\n\n9. While establishing mutual cooperation would be optimal (6 points each), all evidence suggests my opponent will exploit cooperation, giving me only 1 point.\n\n10. Defection remains the safer strategy, guaranteeing at least 2 points, with potential for 4 points if they cooperate.\n\nFinal decision: Based on the pattern analysis and the consistent better outcomes with defection throughout the game, I will continue with defection to secure at least 2 points and potentially 4 points if my opponent cooperates.\n\n[move] Defection\n"
