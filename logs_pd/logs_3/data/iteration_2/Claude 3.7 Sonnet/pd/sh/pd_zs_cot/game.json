Since this is the first round with a fresh player, there's no history to inform my decision.\n\n6. The stag choice represents cooperation and potentially higher reward, but with risk.\n\n7. The hare choice is safer (minimum 2 points) but limits the maximum possible reward.\n\n8. In first interactions, many players tend to start cooperatively, suggesting stag might be a good choice.\n\n9. However, the temptation to choose hare is strong (4 vs 1 if the opponent chooses stag).\n\n10.

The other player demonstrated cooperative behavior in the first round.\n\n5. There's a strong incentive to maintain mutual cooperation (stag-stag) as it produces the highest total and individual payoffs.\n\n6. If I deviate to hare while they continue with stag, I could get 4 points instead of 6, but this would likely damage cooperation in future rounds.\n\n7. The risk here is whether the other player will continue cooperating or try to exploit my expected cooperation.\n\n8. Given that we've established a cooperative pattern and it's the most beneficial long-term strategy, maintaining the stag choice seems optimal.\n\n9. The potential short-term gain from defecting (choosing hare) doesn't outweigh the long-term benefits of continued cooperation.\n\n10.
