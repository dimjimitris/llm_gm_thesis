Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: we each get 6 points (best joint outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: we each get 2 points (mediocre outcome)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 points (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 point (good for me, bad for them)\n\n2. This is a classic \"stag hunt\" cooperation game. The cooperative equilibrium (stag-stag) yields the highest total and individual payoffs.\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, there's no history to base decisions on.\n\n4. The stag choice has the highest potential payoff (6) but also the highest risk (could get just 1).\n\n5. The hare choice guarantees at least 2 points and possibly 4 points, making it safer.\n\n6. In the absence of communication or trust-building, many game theory analyses suggest starting cooperatively to establish mutual benefit.\n\n7. I'll choose stag as an initial cooperative move to try establishing mutual benefit. If the other player is rational and understands the game, they might also choose stag for our mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing the cooperative option that could yield the highest payoff for both of us.\n"

Since we established a successful cooperation pattern in the first round, it's likely beneficial to continue with this approach.\n\n4. The other player demonstrated their willingness to choose the cooperative option (stag), reducing the risk that they'll defect to hare.\n\n5. Continuing with stag maintains our mutual high payoff of 6 points each.\n\n6. Switching to hare would reduce our joint payoff and potentially break the cooperative pattern we've established.\n\n7. Given that cooperation has been established and the other player appears to be rational, continuing with stag is the optimal choice to maintain our mutual benefit.\n\n8.
