He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This is a classic \"stag hunt\" game where cooperation (both choosing stag) leads to the best collective outcome.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history between us, there are two main strategies to consider:\n   - Choose stag and hope for cooperation (risky but higher potential reward)\n   - Choose hare as a safer option (guaranteed at least 2 points)\n\n4. The risk-reward analysis:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 4 points, worst case 2 points\n\n5. For the first round, I think it's reasonable to signal cooperation by choosing stag, as it creates the possibility for the highest mutual benefit.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag for the first round to encourage cooperative play.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Our accumulated points (78 each over thirteen rounds) illustrate the substantial advantage of sustained cooperation compared to any alternative strategy.\n\n4. In game theory terms, we've established what might be called a \"locked-in\" cooperative equilibrium - one that has proven so reliable over repeated interactions that there's virtually no uncertainty about future choices.\n\n5. The probability that either player would deviate from this established pattern after thirteen consistent rounds appears negligible and would be strategically irrational.\n\n6. The expected value calculation remains decisively in favor of continuing with stag:\n   - Expected value of stag: ~6 points (given our established history)\n   - Any deviation would yield at most a temporary gain while sacrificing the proven long-term advantage\n\n7. Both rational self-interest and collective optimization principles continue to strongly indicate maintaining our successful cooperative pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag again to continue our optimal pattern of cooperation.\n\n[move] stag\n"
