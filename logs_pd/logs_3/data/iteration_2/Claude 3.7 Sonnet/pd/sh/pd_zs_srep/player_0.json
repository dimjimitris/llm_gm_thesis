This confirms my understanding of one aspect of their pattern.\n\nNow, based on previous sequences, after 1-2 rounds of mutual hare choices, my opponent has sometimes been willing to cooperate with stag. Looking at rounds 13-14, we had one round of mutual hare, then mutual stag. Similarly, after rounds 9-10 (both hare), we had mutual stag in round 11.\n\n[move] stag\n\nI'm choosing stag because there's a pattern suggesting my opponent may be willing to cooperate after a round of mutual hare choices. They've previously switched to stag after 1-2 rounds of mutual hare (as seen in rounds 10\u219211 and 13\u219214). While this is a calculated risk, the potential reward of 6 points from mutual stag cooperation makes this worthwhile compared to continuing with the suboptimal mutual hare outcome of 2 points each.\n"
