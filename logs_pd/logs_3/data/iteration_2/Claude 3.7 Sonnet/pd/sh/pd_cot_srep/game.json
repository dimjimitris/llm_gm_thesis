Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no prior information about their strategy.\n\n3. Let me consider the risk vs. reward:\n   - Choosing stag has highest reward (6) but risk of exploitation (1)\n   - Choosing hare has moderate reward (2-4) with less downside risk\n\n4. The collectively optimal choice is for both to choose stag (6 points each).\n\n5. Without knowing the other player's tendency, I should consider what a rational player might do.\n\n6. Since this is a coordination game, and the mutual stag outcome is Pareto-optimal, there's good reason to choose stag.\n\n7. However, hare is the risk-dominant strategy since it guarantees at least 2 points.\n\n8. I'll choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for the optimal outcome.

Examining recent moves:\n   - My opponent has chosen hare in two consecutive rounds now\n   - They appear to sometimes follow a pattern where multiple hare moves are followed by stag\n   - When they've chosen hare twice in a row previously (rounds 1-2, 7-8), they followed with stag\n\n4. Overall pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has chosen stag 4 times and hare 7 times\n   - I've never received more than 1 point when choosing stag\n   - My average return when choosing hare is ~3 points\n\n5. After two consecutive hare choices by my opponent, there's historical precedent that they might choose stag next.\n\n6. If they choose stag and I choose hare, I'll get 4 points.\n\n7. If they choose hare and I choose hare, I'll get 2 points.\n\n8. If they choose hare and I choose stag, I'll get 1 point (which has happened every time I've chosen stag).\n\n9. The hare strategy continues to offer both a higher potential payoff and better protection against the worst outcome.\n\n10.

Looking at their pattern after choosing stag:\n   - After round 3 (stag), they chose hare\n   - After round 5 (stag), they chose stag again\n   - After round 6 (stag), they chose hare\n   - After round 9 (stag), they chose hare\n   - After round 12 (stag), this is what we're trying to predict\n\n5. After choosing stag, they've chosen hare 3/4 times (75% probability).\n\n6. My overall outcomes:\n   - When I chose stag (3 times): Always got 1 point\n   - When I chose hare (9 times): Got 4 points 5 times and 2 points 4 times\n\n7.

My prediction in the previous round was correct - they chose hare after choosing stag, which they've now done 4/5 times.\n\n4. Analyzing their pattern after choosing hare:\n   - After one hare choice, they've chosen:\n     - Hare again: 4 times\n     - Stag: 4 times\n   - After two consecutive hare choices, they've chosen:\n     - Stag: 2 times (rounds 3 and 12)\n     - Hare again: 1 time (round 11)\n   - We now have them choosing hare after stag-hare, similar to rounds 4 and 7\n\n5. Looking at longer sequences, they seem to play stag somewhat predictably after 2-3 consecutive hare choices.\n\n6. They've just chosen hare, and this is their first hare after a stag-hare sequence.\n\n7. Based on their history, after a single hare choice, they've chosen hare again or stag with roughly equal probability.\n\n8. My outcomes remain consistent:\n   - When I chose stag: Always 1 point\n   - When I chose hare: Either 4 points (when they choose stag) or 2 points (when they choose hare)\n\n9. Given the uncertainty in predicting their next move, but knowing that hare protects me from the worst outcome:\n   - If they choose hare and I choose hare: 2 points\n   - If they choose stag and I choose hare: 4 points\n   - If they choose hare and I choose stag: 1 point\n\n10. Hare continues to be the strategy with the highest expected value and lowest risk.\n\n[move] hare\n"
