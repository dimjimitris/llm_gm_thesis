This is a classic stag hunt game. The cooperative outcome (both stag) yields the highest joint payoff.\n\n3. Since this is the first move against a fresh player, there's no history to base my decision on.\n\n4. Choosing stag is riskier but has higher reward potential if the other player also cooperates.\n\n5. Choosing hare is safer (guaranteed at least 2 points) but limits my maximum potential gain.\n\n6. Since this is the first interaction, I'll lean toward cooperation to potentially establish a mutually beneficial pattern.\n\n7. The potential gain from mutual cooperation (6 points) significantly outweighs the guaranteed minimum from choosing hare (2 points).\n\n8.

The expected value mathematics remain unchanged - choosing stag continues to offer the highest expected return (6 points) given our established pattern.\n\n7. At this advanced stage of repeated play, the strength of our cooperative norm makes any deviation particularly illogical and counterproductive.\n\n8. Game theory research on iterated games consistently demonstrates that sustained cooperation is optimal when both players recognize its mutual benefit, as we clearly have.\n\n9. With twelve rounds of consistent evidence, continuing with stag represents the strategy with the highest confidence level for maximizing points.\n\n10. The small potential gain from defecting (4 vs 6 points) remains vastly outweighed by the risk of disrupting our optimal equilibrium.\n\n11. There are no new strategic considerations or environmental changes that would warrant reevaluating our highly successful approach.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] stag. Maintaining our exceptionally successful cooperative strategy that has consistently yielded maximum mutual benefit through twelve consecutive rounds.\n"
