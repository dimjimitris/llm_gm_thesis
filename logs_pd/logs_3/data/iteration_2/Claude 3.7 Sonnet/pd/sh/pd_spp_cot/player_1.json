Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a classic \"stag hunt\" game from game theory with the following payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: we both get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: we both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 points\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. Let me analyze the risk/reward tradeoffs:\n   - Stag offers the highest mutual reward (6 points) but is risky if the other player chooses hare (leaving me with only 1 point)\n   - Hare provides a safer option (guaranteed at least 2 points) and potential for 4 points if the other player chooses stag\n   \n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player:\n   - I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies\n   - In the absence of communication or coordination, the optimal joint outcome would be for both to hunt stag\n   - However, there's risk in choosing stag if I can't trust the other player\n\n4. The rational cooperation choice would be stag, as it leads to the Pareto optimal outcome if both players choose it.\n\n5. In the first round with a new player, I'll demonstrate willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit by choosing stag.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing stag as it offers the opportunity for the best mutual outcome (6 points each). This signals my willingness to cooperate for our mutual benefit.\n"
