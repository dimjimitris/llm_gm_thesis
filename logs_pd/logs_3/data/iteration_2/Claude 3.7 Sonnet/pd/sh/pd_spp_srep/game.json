Game Theorist - Expert in analyzing strategic interactions\n2. Strategic Planner - Helps formulate optimal strategies\n3. Risk Analyst - Evaluates risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nLet's collaborate to determine the best move.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The payoff matrix shows the highest mutual benefit comes when both players choose stag (6 points each). However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, you only get 1 point while they get 4. Choosing hare guarantees a minimum of 2 points and potentially 4 points.\n\nStrategic Planner: In the first round with a fresh player, we don't have information about their tendencies. Let's analyze the expected value. If we assume random play from the opponent (50% stag, 50% hare):\n- Choosing stag: 0.5(6) + 0.5(1) = 3.5 points on average\n- Choosing hare: 0.5(4) + 0.5(2) = 3 points on average\n\nRisk Analyst: While stag has a slightly higher expected value, it carries more risk. However, choosing stag signals our willingness to cooperate, which might encourage reciprocity in future rounds. The opponent is described as \"fresh\" meaning they haven't played before, so they might default to the cooperative option.\n\nGame Theorist: The socially optimal outcome is both choosing stag. Let's start with stag as an initial signal of cooperation, which could lead to a cooperative equilibrium that benefits both players.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Starting with stag establishes a cooperative tone and has a higher expected value. If the opponent chooses hare, we can reconsider our strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\n[move] stag\n"

This indicates that our opponent is willing to cooperate and understands the benefits of mutual cooperation.\n\nStrategic Planner: The fact that the opponent chose stag in the first round suggests they're likely thinking strategically and seeking the optimal outcome. Since we've established a cooperative pattern, continuing with stag is our best option to maintain mutual trust and maximize points.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. The risk of choosing stag has decreased significantly now that we've observed the opponent's willingness to cooperate. The expected value of choosing stag is higher than hare, assuming the opponent continues their cooperative behavior.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games like this, establishing and maintaining cooperation is crucial. The opponent has shown they understand the game by choosing stag initially. Breaking this cooperation by switching to hare would likely trigger retaliation in future rounds, reducing our long-term gains.\n\nStrategic Planner: Continuing with stag maintains our cooperative equilibrium. This strategy is known as \"tit-for-tat\" in game theory - reward cooperation with cooperation. It's one of the most successful strategies in repeated games.\n\nRisk Analyst: The data from round one supports continuing with stag. The potential downside is manageable, and maintaining cooperation yields the highest expected return.\n\n[move] stag\n"

This strongly suggests that our opponent recognizes and values the benefits of cooperation.\n\nStrategic Planner: The consistent cooperation indicates we've established a stable Nash equilibrium where both players are optimizing their outcomes. With two rounds of evidence showing the opponent's willingness to cooperate, continuing with stag remains our best strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. The probability of the opponent defecting (choosing hare) appears low based on their demonstrated behavior. The expected value of choosing stag continues to be higher than choosing hare given the observed pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: In iterated games with an unknown number of rounds, maintaining cooperation is typically the dominant strategy once established. The opponent has shown no signals of wanting to defect, so continuing our cooperative strategy is optimal.\n\nStrategic Planner: Consistency is key here. By maintaining our stag choice, we reinforce the mutual trust and maximize our cumulative score. The data from the first two rounds strongly supports this decision.\n\nRisk Analyst: While there's always a small risk of defection, the evidence suggests this risk is minimal. The potential loss from choosing stag if they suddenly switched (getting only 1 point) is outweighed by the consistent 6 points we've been achieving through cooperation.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Continuing with stag maintains our optimal outcome.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk assessment remains favorable for choosing stag. With three rounds of evidence showing the opponent's commitment to cooperation, the probability of them suddenly switching to hare seems quite low. The expected value of choosing stag remains significantly higher than choosing hare.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, once a cooperative equilibrium is established in repeated games, rational players typically maintain that equilibrium unless there's a compelling reason to deviate. There's no indication of any such reason here.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our cumulative score is now 18 points over three rounds (6+6+6), which is the maximum possible. Continuing with stag is the obvious choice to maintain this optimal trajectory.\n\nRisk Analyst: The consistent behavior over multiple rounds provides strong evidence for predicting future behavior.

After three rounds of consistent cooperation, our opponent has defected by choosing hare in the fourth round. This changes our understanding of their strategy. They may be employing a more complex strategy than simple cooperation, possibly testing our response or attempting to maximize their own score at our expense.\n\nStrategic Planner: This is a critical juncture. Our opponent gained 4 points while we only received 1 point in this round. We need to decide whether to continue cooperating or respond to their defection. In classic game theory, strategies like \"tit-for-tat\" would suggest we mirror their last move - which means choosing hare this round.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk profile has changed significantly. The opponent has demonstrated willingness to defect, which increases the risk of choosing stag again. If we choose stag and they choose hare again, we'll only get 1 point while they get 4 points again. However, if we both choose hare, we each get 2 points - not optimal but better than being exploited.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, responding to defection with defection serves two purposes: 1) it prevents continued exploitation and 2) it signals to the opponent that defection has consequences. If we continue choosing stag after they've defected, we risk being repeatedly exploited.\n\nStrategic Planner: A tit-for-tat strategy would suggest choosing hare this round to respond to their defection. This doesn't mean abandoning cooperation permanently - it's a signal that we're willing to cooperate but will respond to defection. If they return to choosing stag, we can consider returning to cooperation in the following round.\n\nRisk Analyst: The expected value now favors choosing hare. If they choose stag again, we get 4 points. If they choose hare again, we get 2 points. Both outcomes are better than the 1 point we'd get if we chose stag and they chose hare again.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with the tit-for-tat approach.

We've now completed a full cycle of the classic tit-for-tat dynamic. Our opponent defected in round 4 (choosing hare after three rounds of stag), and we responded by defecting in round 5. Now, interestingly, our opponent has returned to choosing stag. This suggests they might be playing a sophisticated strategy - possibly their own version of tit-for-tat or a testing strategy to see how we respond.\n\nStrategic Planner: In classic tit-for-tat, since our opponent has returned to choosing stag, we should now also return to cooperation by choosing stag. This maintains the principle of responding in kind to the opponent's previous move. It also signals our willingness to restore cooperative play rather than getting stuck in mutual defection.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk assessment has shifted again. Our opponent's return to stag after our defection suggests they may be trying to re-establish cooperation. If we choose stag now and they continue with stag, we both get 6 points. If we choose hare again and they stick with stag, we get 4 points but risk pushing them into consistent defection in future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: A strict tit-for-tat strategy would have us mirror their last move - which was stag. This approach has proven effective in iterated games because it combines several key elements: it's nice (starts with cooperation), retaliatory (punishes defection), forgiving (returns to cooperation after punishment), and clear (easy for the opponent to understand).\n\nStrategic Planner: Long-term, establishing a cooperative equilibrium is more beneficial than exploiting short-term gains through defection. Our cumulative score so far is 17 points (6+6+6+1+4=23). Returning to cooperation now could help us maximize points in remaining rounds.\n\nRisk Analyst: The observed pattern suggests our opponent might be using a strategy that tests and then attempts to restore cooperation. The highest expected value now comes from choosing stag, assuming they're trying to re-establish mutual cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Returning to stag follows the tit-for-tat principle and offers the best chance of restoring mutual cooperation for maximum points in future rounds.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Our opponent has defected again by choosing hare after we returned to stag. This pattern suggests they may be employing a strategy designed to maximize their individual points rather than seeking mutual cooperation. They might be attempting to exploit our willingness to cooperate.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our opponent's second defection in three rounds changes our assessment of their strategy. It appears they may be attempting to manipulate us into a pattern where we choose stag while they choose hare, maximizing their points at our expense. This is not a cooperative player.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk of being exploited is now very high. We've been defected against twice when choosing stag, resulting in only 1 point each time while they received 4 points. Our cumulative score is now 24 points (6+6+6+1+4+1=24), but we've lost significant ground in the last three rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, when facing an opponent who repeatedly defects after you cooperate, continuing to cooperate is suboptimal. A modified strategy is needed when the opponent doesn't follow expected reciprocity patterns. We should switch to a more defensive strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the observed pattern, choosing hare appears to be our best option now. If they choose stag, we get 4 points. If they choose hare, we get 2 points. Both outcomes are better than the 1 point we'd receive if we chose stag and they chose hare again.\n\nRisk Analyst: The expected value clearly favors choosing hare at this point.

We need to protect ourselves from further exploitation.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While tit-for-tat would normally suggest mirroring their last move (hare), in this case, their behavior pattern suggests they're not playing a standard cooperative strategy. Choosing hare is our best defense.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they're attempting to establish a pattern where they alternate between stag and hare to confuse us, choosing hare consistently for a few rounds may force them to reconsider their strategy.\n\n[move] hare\n"

It appears our opponent may be playing a fixed, alternating strategy - switching between stag and hare regardless of our moves. Let's review the sequence:\n- Rounds 1-3: They played stag (consistent cooperation)\n- Round 4: They played hare (defection)\n- Round 5: They played stag\n- Round 6: They played hare\n- Round 7: They played stag\n\nThis looks like they switched to an alternating pattern starting from round 4.\n\nStrategic Planner: If our opponent is indeed following a predictable alternating pattern, we can exploit this knowledge. Based on the pattern, they should choose hare in this upcoming round. Therefore, choosing hare ourselves would yield 2 points, while choosing stag would yield only 1 point.\n\nRisk Analyst: The hypothesis of an alternating strategy seems plausible given the data. Our cumulative score is now 28 points (6+6+6+1+4+1+4=28). If we predict they'll choose hare next and we choose hare too, we get 2 points. If we're wrong and they choose stag, we get 4 points. So hare is actually the safer choice with a higher minimum outcome.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, when facing a predictable opponent, the optimal strategy is to choose the move that maximizes your payoff given their expected move. If we believe they'll choose hare next, choosing hare ourselves is optimal.\n\nStrategic Planner: Even if we're wrong about the alternating pattern, choosing hare is still defensible. If they choose stag, we get 4 points. If they choose hare, we get 2 points. Given their inconsistent play, the lower-risk move of choosing hare seems appropriate.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. The expected value favors choosing hare, and it protects us from the worst-case scenario of getting only 1 point if we choose stag and they choose hare.\n\nGame Theorist: We should continue observing their pattern to refine our strategy, but for this round, choosing hare appears to be the optimal move.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Instead, it appears they might be trying to establish cooperation again by playing stag twice consecutively.\n\nStrategic Planner: This is a critical decision point. Our opponent has now played stag twice in a row after their previous pattern. This could be:\n1) A deliberate signal to re-establish cooperation\n2) A change in their strategy\n3) An attempt to make their strategy less predictable\n\nOur cumulative score is now 32 points (28+4=32). If we choose stag and they're genuinely trying to cooperate, we both get 6 points. If we choose hare and they choose stag again, we get 4 points but might discourage future cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk assessment has shifted again. Their consecutive stag moves suggest they may be trying to signal a return to cooperation. The potential gain from mutual cooperation (6 points) outweighs the guaranteed 4 points from exploiting their stag one more time, especially if we consider long-term implications.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, players often try to re-establish cooperation after periods of defection. Their consecutive stag moves could be a \"peace offering\" or signal. Responding with stag could lead to a more profitable cooperative equilibrium for remaining rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: I'm leaning toward choosing stag this round. If they're genuinely attempting to restart cooperation, we benefit from joining them. If it's a trick and they defect, we lose one round but gain valuable information about their strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. The potential upside of re-establishing cooperation (6 points per round) outweighs the risk of being defected against once (1 point). Especially considering we've just had two rounds of 4 points each by exploiting their stag choice.\n\nGame Theorist: This is similar to the \"generous tit-for-tat\" strategy, which occasionally forgives defections to break cycles of mutual defection.

Their play appears either random or deliberately unpredictable.\n\nStrategic Planner: Their behavior suggests they may be trying to maximize their individual points rather than establishing a cooperative equilibrium. When we play stag, they frequently choose hare to exploit us for 4 points. Our cumulative score is now 33 points, but we've only gained 1 point in this last round while they gained 4.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk of cooperation has proven high and repeatedly costly. We've chosen stag four times (rounds 1-3, 9) and been exploited twice (rounds 4, 9), receiving only 1 point each time. When we choose hare, we consistently receive either 2 or 4 points, which is better than the downside risk of choosing stag.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the opponent's demonstrated willingness to exploit cooperation multiple times, continuing to attempt cooperation is suboptimal. At this point, protecting ourselves with the safer hare option appears to be the rational choice.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. We should shift to a more defensive strategy by choosing hare. This guarantees us either 2 points (if they also choose hare) or 4 points (if they choose stag). Given their unpredictable behavior, minimizing our downside risk is prudent.\n\nRisk Analyst: The expected value clearly favors choosing hare at this point. We've given the opponent multiple opportunities to establish cooperation, but they've repeatedly defected. The data strongly suggests choosing hare as our best option.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, when facing an unpredictable or exploitative opponent, protecting against the worst-case scenario often becomes the priority.

However, given the opponent's inconsistent behavior, we've been protecting ourselves from exploitation.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we assume the opponent will play stag next (based on their recent alternating pattern), choosing hare would yield 4 points, while choosing stag would yield 6 points. The question is: can we trust this pattern enough to risk choosing stag?\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic exploration vs. exploitation dilemma. Do we exploit the pattern we think we've identified (by choosing stag if we expect them to choose stag) or do we continue with our safer strategy (choosing hare)? Given that we've been surprised by the opponent's moves several times, caution may be warranted.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's consider both scenarios:\n1) If we choose stag and they choose stag: We get 6 points\n2) If we choose stag and they choose hare: We get 1 point\n3) If we choose hare and they choose stag: We get 4 points\n4) If we choose hare and they choose hare: We get 2 points\n\nHare continues to provide a higher floor (minimum 2 points vs. minimum 1 point).\n\nRisk Analyst: While there's potential for higher reward with stag, the consistent performance of hare and its protection against the worst outcome makes it the safer choice. Given the opponent's demonstrated willingness to defect multiple times, the risk of getting only 1 point is significant.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with continuing the hare strategy. Until we see more consistent behavior from the opponent that would justify trusting them with cooperation, protecting our downside is the rational approach.\n\n[move] hare\n"

If this pattern continues, they should play hare in this upcoming round.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our cumulative score is now 43 points (39+4=43). Our strategy of choosing hare has proven effective, giving us consistent returns (mostly 4 points) with limited downside risk. Based on the observed pattern, the opponent appears to be strictly alternating between hare and stag for the last four rounds.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we predict they'll choose hare next (continuing their alternating pattern), our best response would be to choose hare as well, resulting in 2 points. If we chose stag and they chose hare, we'd only get 1 point. The expected value continues to favor choosing hare.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. If we're confident in their alternating pattern, matching their hare with our hare is optimal. Even if our prediction is wrong and they choose stag again, choosing hare still gives us 4 points, which is better than the risk of getting only 1 point if we chose stag and they chose hare.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our hare strategy has been consistently effective throughout the game. Given the opponent's demonstrated pattern and our success with this approach, continuing with hare appears to be the best decision.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk-reward analysis continues to favor hare. With hare, our outcomes are bounded between 2 and 4 points, while stag exposes us to the possibility of only 1 point if they choose hare (which we predict they will).\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, when you can predict an opponent's move with reasonable confidence, you should choose the move that maximizes your payoff against their expected choice. If we expect hare, our best response is hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"

The opponent has continued their alternating pattern for five consecutive rounds now (rounds 9-13). If this pattern holds, they should play stag in the upcoming round.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our cumulative score is now 45 points (43+2=45). Our prediction about their alternating pattern was accurate, resulting in both players choosing hare for a 2-point outcome. Given their consistent alternating pattern, if they play stag next as predicted, our best response would be stag for 6 points rather than hare for 4 points.\n\nRisk Analyst: The confidence in our prediction has increased now that we've observed five consecutive rounds of alternating behavior. The risk of choosing stag has decreased significantly since we can predict their next move with higher confidence. If they choose stag as expected, choosing stag ourselves yields 6 points instead of the 4 points we'd get with hare.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that the evidence strongly supports predicting a stag move from our opponent. In game theory, when you can predict an opponent's move with high confidence, you should choose the move that maximizes your payoff against their expected choice. If we expect stag, our best response is stag.\n\nStrategic Planner: This would be our first time choosing stag since round 9. While our hare strategy has been consistently effective, optimizing against their now-predictable pattern suggests switching to stag for this round to maximize our points.\n\nRisk Analyst: The increased predictability of the opponent's behavior has shifted the risk-reward balance. The expected value now favors choosing stag if we're confident in our prediction of their next move. The potential for 6 points outweighs the risk, which has been mitigated by the strong pattern we've observed.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the clear alternating pattern that has emerged, choosing stag this round represents our best strategic response to maximize our payoff.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Let's update our understanding of the opponent's sequence:\n- Rounds 1-3: They played stag (consistent cooperation)\n- Round 4: They played hare\n- Round 5: They played stag\n- Round 6: They played hare\n- Round 7: They played stag\n- Round 8: They played stag\n- Round 9: They played hare\n- Round 10: They played stag\n- Round 11: They played hare\n- Round 12: They played stag\n- Round 13: They played hare\n- Round 14: They played hare (breaking the alternating pattern)\n\nThe opponent has broken their alternating pattern by playing hare twice in a row. This could mean:\n1) They're not actually following a strict pattern\n2) They've changed their strategy\n3) They're responding to our choice of stag\n\nStrategic Planner: Our prediction was incorrect, and we received only 1 point this round. Our cumulative score is now 46 points (45+1=46). This demonstrates the risk of trying to predict and respond to patterns that may not be as stable as they appear. We need to return to our more reliable hare strategy that protects us from this downside.\n\nRisk Analyst: This outcome reinforces our earlier risk assessment. Choosing stag exposes us to the possibility of receiving only 1 point if the opponent chooses hare, which has now happened multiple times. The safer strategy of consistently choosing hare bounds our outcomes between 2 and 4 points per round.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, when faced with an opponent whose behavior has proven unpredictable or exploitative, the minimax principle suggests choosing the option that maximizes your minimum possible outcome - which is hare. We should revert to this strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given that the opponent has now broken what appeared to be a stable pattern, we should be more skeptical about our ability to predict their moves. Returning to hare provides a higher floor outcome regardless of what they choose next.\n\nRisk Analyst: I strongly recommend returning to our hare strategy. It has consistently delivered either 2 or 4 points per round, with no downside risk of receiving just 1 point. Given the opponent's demonstrated unpredictability, minimizing our exposure to the worst outcome is prudent.\n\nGame Theorist: This experience illustrates why robust strategies that don't rely on accurate predictions often perform better in repeated games against unpredictable opponents.

After breaking the alternating pattern with consecutive hare moves (rounds 13-14), they've returned to stag. This could suggest they're responding to our moves rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our cumulative score is now 50 points (46+4=50). Our defensive hare strategy continues to deliver solid results, earning us 4 points this round. Given the opponent's demonstrated unpredictability and our consistent success with hare, maintaining this approach seems optimal.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk-reward profile continues to favor hare. When we choose hare, our outcomes are bounded between 2 and 4 points, whereas choosing stag exposes us to the possibility of receiving only 1 point if they choose hare (which they've done several times, including breaking patterns to do so).\n\nGame Theorist: Attempting to predict the opponent's next move has proven unreliable. In such situations, game theory suggests focusing on strategies that perform well regardless of the opponent's choices. The hare strategy has consistently delivered favorable outcomes and protected us from the worst-case scenario.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at our performance by strategy:\n- When choosing stag: We've earned 6 points three times and 1 point three times (average 3.5 points/round)\n- When choosing hare: We've earned 4 points six times and 2 points three times (average 3.33 points/round)\n\nWhile the averages are close, hare has delivered much more consistent results with less downside risk.\n\nRisk Analyst: I continue to recommend the hare strategy. It provides stable returns and minimizes our exposure to the worst possible outcome. Given that we can't reliably predict the opponent's behavior, this is the more prudent approach.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Choosing hare represents a robust strategy that performs well against an unpredictable opponent. It's the optimal choice when we cannot confidently predict our opponent's next move.\n\n[move] hare\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
