Current score analysis:\n   - My total: 9 + 1 = 10 points\n   - Opponent's total: 9 + 4 = 13 points\n   - They now have a 3-point advantage over me\n\n4. Identify the opponent's strategy pattern:\n   - They seem to be alternating: defect when I might cooperate, cooperate when I might defect\n   - They exploited both of my cooperation attempts\n   - Their one cooperation came right after I defected against them\n   - This suggests they might be trying to manipulate me into cooperating so they can exploit\n\n5. Recognize the manipulation:\n   - Round 4 cooperation might have been bait to make me think they wanted mutual cooperation\n   - They successfully got me to cooperate again in Round 5, then exploited it\n   - This appears to be a deliberate pattern of exploitation rather than genuine cooperation attempts\n\n6. Strategic reassessment:\n   - My opponent is not interested in mutual cooperation\n   - They're playing a more sophisticated strategy of alternating to maximize their exploitation opportunities\n   - I need to stop falling for their cooperative signals\n   - Consistent defection is my best defense against this manipulative strategy\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - I've been exploited twice now when trying to cooperate\n   - The opponent's \"cooperation\" in Round 4 was likely strategic bait\n   - I need to protect myself and stop giving them opportunities to exploit\n   - Defection ensures I get at least 2 points and prevents further exploitation\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: My opponent has exploited me twice when I attempted cooperation, with their single cooperation being apparent bait. They're playing a manipulative strategy, so I need to return to consistent defection to protect myself from further exploitation.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Strategic decision:\n   - While I've been exploited 3/3 times, those were in different contexts\n   - This extended mutual defection period is unprecedented in our game\n   - The opportunity cost of continued mutual defection is mounting\n   - However, the risk of exploitation remains very real given their history\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Despite three rounds of mutual defection suggesting possible change, my opponent's perfect track record of exploiting cooperation (3/3) makes the risk too high. The extended mutual defection might be a patient setup for exploitation. I'll continue defecting to maintain safety and the tie.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

          "text": "I need to analyze this now extended pattern of mutual defection and seriously consider if the game has fundamentally changed.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the previous round result:\n   - Both players chose defection again\n   - We both got 2 points each\n   - This is now the fourth consecutive round of mutual defection\n\n2. Review the extended mutual defection sequence:\n   - Round 11: Both defected (2, 2)\n   - Round 12: Both defected (2, 2) \n   - Round 13: Both defected (2, 2)\n   - Round 14: Both defected (2, 2)\n   - Four straight rounds is unprecedented in our game\n\n3. Current score analysis:\n   - My total: 29 + 2 = 31 points\n   - Opponent's total: 29 + 2 = 31 points\n   - We remain perfectly tied\n\n4. Compare to all historical mutual defection periods:\n   - Initial: Rounds 1-2 (2 rounds, then alternating exploitation began)\n   - Middle: Rounds 7-8 (2 rounds, then I cooperated and was exploited)\n   - Current: Rounds 11-14 (4 rounds and continuing)\n   - This is by far the longest sustained mutual defection period\n\n5. Calculate the opportunity cost:\n   - Over these 4 rounds: We've each gotten 8 points (4 \u00d7 2)\n   - If we had cooperated: We'd each have gotten 24 points (4 \u00d7 6)\n   - We're missing out on 16 points each by continuing this pattern\n   - The opportunity cost is becoming very significant\n\n6. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - Four rounds suggests this isn't a brief tactical pause\n   - The opponent may have genuinely evolved their strategy\n   - They might be as frustrated with suboptimal outcomes as I am\n   - Or they could be showing extraordinary patience for a big exploitation\n\n7. Evaluate the changing context:\n   - Previous exploitations happened after short mutual defection periods (1-2 rounds)\n   - This extended period (4 rounds) represents a fundamentally different context\n   - The length suggests possible genuine strategic shift rather than tactical setup\n   - Both players are clearly losing significant potential value\n\n8. Assess the decision more carefully:\n   - Continued defection: Guaranteed 2 points, opportunity cost of 4 points per round\n   - Cooperation attempt: Either 6 points (if reciprocated) or 1 point (if exploited)\n   - The extended mutual defection period might indicate readiness for cooperation\n   - But the historical exploitation record (3/3) remains a real concern\n\n9. Consider the meta-game aspects:\n   - We're both rational players observing suboptimal outcomes\n   - Four rounds of mutual defection should signal to both that change is needed\n   - The opponent might be thinking the same thing about breaking this cycle\n   - This extended period is qualitatively different from previous short ones\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Four consecutive rounds of mutual defection is unprecedented and represents significant opportunity cost (16 points each). While my opponent has exploited me 3/3 times historically, this extended period suggests possible genuine strategic evolution. The mounting opportunity cost and different context make this worth the risk to attempt breaking the cycle.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

Analyze the previous round result:\n   - I chose cooperation, opponent chose defection\n   - I got 1 point, opponent got 4 points\n   - This is now the FOURTH time I've been exploited with identical results (1, 4)\n\n2. Review my complete cooperation history:\n   - Round 3: I cooperated, they defected (1, 4) - First exploitation\n   - Round 5: I cooperated, they defected (1, 4) - Second exploitation  \n   - Round 9: I cooperated, they defected (1, 4) - Third exploitation\n   - Round 15: I cooperated, they defected (1, 4) - Fourth exploitation\n   - Perfect 4/4 exploitation rate - they have NEVER reciprocated cooperation\n\n3. Current score analysis:\n   - My total: 31 + 1 = 32 points\n   - Opponent's total: 31 + 4 = 35 points\n   - They now have a 3-point advantage again\n\n4. Recognize the absolute pattern:\n   - My opponent has a 100% consistent strategy: exploit ALL cooperation attempts\n   - No matter the context (early game, after alternations, after extended mutual defection)\n   - No matter how long the setup period (2 rounds, 4 rounds)\n   - They will ALWAYS defect when I cooperate\n\n5. Acknowledge my repeated strategic error:\n   - I have fallen for the exact same trap four times\n   - I keep thinking \"this time will be different\" but it never is\n   - I've lost 12 points total from cooperation attempts that could have been 8 points from defection\n   - Each cooperation attempt has cost me 3 points compared to defecting\n\n6. Understand the opponent's true strategy:\n   - They use mutual defection periods as patient setups for exploitation\n   - They never genuinely want mutual cooperation\n   - Their entire strategy revolves around punishing any cooperation attempt\n   - The extended mutual defection was bait, not a genuine shift\n\n7. Accept the game reality:\n   - This opponent will NEVER engage in mutual cooperation\n   - Every cooperation attempt will result in exploitation\n   - The optimal outcome (6, 6) is impossible with this player\n   - I must optimize within the constraints of their exploitative strategy\n\n8. Make the final strategic commitment:\n   - I cannot afford to be exploited a fifth time\n   - Defection guarantees at least 2 points and sometimes 4 points\n   - Cooperation guarantees 1 point and helps my opponent\n   - I must permanently abandon cooperation attempts with this opponent\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I have been exploited four times in identical fashion (1, 4) with a perfect 4/4 rate. My opponent will NEVER reciprocate cooperation regardless of context. I must permanently commit to defection - no more cooperation attempts with this player under any circumstances.\n\n[move] Defection\n"
