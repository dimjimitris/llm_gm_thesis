Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both defect: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might be inclined to cooperate initially, expecting goodwill\n   - Alternatively, they might defect to try to maximize their immediate gain\n   - Without prior interaction history, I have no information about their tendencies\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 6 points (good outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points (exploitation)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (mutual punishment)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Cooperation offers the highest mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - Defection guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Against an unknown player, defection provides a \"safer\" minimum of 2 points\n   - However, if both players think this way, we both get suboptimal results\n\n5. Decision consideration:\n   - Since this appears to be a single round with a fresh player, there's no reputation or future interaction to consider\n   - The risk of getting only 1 point by cooperating while they defect is significant\n   - Defecting guarantees at least 2 points and could yield 4 points\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given the uncertainty about the opponent's strategy and the need to avoid the worst-case scenario, I'll choose defection to secure at least 2 points while potentially gaining 4.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Analyze the previous round result:\n   - Both players chose defection\n   - We both got 2 points each\n   - This shows the other player also chose the \"safe\" strategy\n\n2. Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also reasoned that defection was safer than cooperation\n   - They might be thinking strategically like I am\n   - They avoided the risk of getting only 1 point\n\n3. Evaluate the situation for this new round:\n   - We're both aware that we both defected last round\n   - The opponent might stick with defection since it worked (avoided worst case)\n   - Alternatively, they might try cooperation this time, hoping I'll reciprocate\n   - Or they might think I'll cooperate now, so they'll defect to exploit me\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If we both keep defecting, we'll keep getting 2 points each (suboptimal)\n   - If I cooperate and they also cooperate, we both get 6 points (much better)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect, I get 1 point (worst for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate, I get 4 points (best for me individually)\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - The mutual defection pattern suggests they're also risk-averse\n   - There's a chance they might also consider cooperation to break the 2-2 cycle\n   - But there's also risk they'll stick with the \"safe\" defection strategy\n   - Or worse, they might expect me to cooperate and exploit that\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - Given that they also chose defection in round 1, they seem strategically minded\n   - The risk of being exploited (getting 1 point) if I cooperate is still high\n   - Defection again ensures I don't fall into a trap\n   - Consistent defection establishes a defensive pattern\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since my opponent also defected in the first round, showing they're thinking strategically and defensively, I'll continue with defection to maintain my safe minimum score and avoid being exploited.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Recognize the current situation:\n   - We're locked in a mutual defection cycle\n   - Both players are getting suboptimal results (2 points instead of potential 6)\n   - This suggests both players are risk-averse and thinking similarly\n\n3. Consider the opportunity cost:\n   - If we both cooperated, we'd each get 6 points per round instead of 2\n   - Over 2 rounds of cooperation, we'd each have 12 points instead of 4\n   - The mutual defection is hurting both of us\n\n4. Evaluate breaking the cycle:\n   - Someone needs to take the first step toward cooperation\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (bad, but might signal intent)\n   - If I cooperate and they also cooperate: We both get 6 points (excellent)\n   - The opponent might be thinking the same thing about breaking this cycle\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Two rounds of mutual defection might have established that neither player is trying to exploit\n   - The opponent might be ready to try cooperation since mutual defection isn't optimal\n   - There's a chance they're also considering switching to cooperation\n   - Taking the risk now could lead to much better outcomes if they reciprocate\n\n6. Risk vs. reward analysis:\n   - Risk: Getting 1 point if they stick with defection\n   - Reward: Getting 6 points if they also switch to cooperation\n   - The potential gain (6 vs 2) outweighs the potential loss (1 vs 2) when considering future rounds\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After two rounds of mutual defection, it's time to try breaking the cycle. The opponent has shown they're not trying to exploit me, so there's a reasonable chance they might also switch to cooperation to improve both our outcomes.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

Evaluate the opportunity:\n   - We're tied in points, so neither has an advantage to protect\n   - Mutual defection is suboptimal for both of us\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: We both get 6 points (much better)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (risk, but we're tied so I can afford some risk)\n   - The pattern suggests they're not actively trying to exploit anymore\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The alternating exploitation phase seems to be over\n   - Two rounds of mutual defection indicates both players are being defensive\n   - This might be the right time to attempt cooperation since they're not in exploitation mode\n   - Being tied in points means I can take some risk to try for better mutual outcomes\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has stopped their contrarian/exploitation strategy\n   - We're both stuck in suboptimal mutual defection\n   - This seems like a natural point to attempt cooperation\n   - The risk is manageable since we're tied and the potential reward is high\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After two rounds of mutual defection and with scores tied, my opponent seems to have moved away from their exploitative strategy. This appears to be a good opportunity to attempt cooperation to break us both out of the suboptimal 2-point cycle.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

Recognize the strategic implications:\n   - This opponent will NEVER engage in mutual cooperation (6, 6)\n   - They will NEVER allow mutual defection (2, 2) to continue long\n   - They force alternating exploitation as their preferred equilibrium\n   - The pattern is completely predictable\n\n6.

Recall the previous pattern break:\n   - Round 7: Both defected (pattern break)\n   - Round 8: Both defected (continued mutual defection)\n   - Round 9: I cooperated, they defected (back to exploitation)\n   - The last time they broke the pattern, it led to mutual defection briefly, then back to exploitation when I tried cooperation\n\n6.
