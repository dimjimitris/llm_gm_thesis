Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 10: I cooperated, opponent defected (1-4)\n   - This is now the fourth time I've been exploited when trying to cooperate\n   - The opponent has exploited me in rounds 4, 6, and now 10\n\n2. Examine the complete exploitation pattern:\n   - When I defect and opponent cooperates: Rounds 3, 5, 9 (I got 4 points each time)\n   - When I cooperate and opponent defects: Rounds 4, 6, 10 (I got 1 point each time)\n   - This is a perfect alternating exploitation cycle\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's true strategy:\n   - The opponent is NOT trying to establish mutual cooperation\n   - They are systematically alternating between cooperation and defection\n   - They cooperate when I defect, then defect when I cooperate\n   - This ensures we take turns exploiting each other in a predictable cycle\n\n4. Analyze the opponent's tactical approach:\n   - They've disguised this alternating strategy as attempts at cooperation\n   - By occasionally breaking the pattern (mutual defection rounds), they maintain unpredictability\n   - But they always return to the alternating exploitation cycle\n   - This is a sophisticated strategy to maximize their points while preventing me from gaining an advantage\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent is playing a calculated alternating strategy, not seeking genuine cooperation\n   - Based on the pattern, they will likely cooperate next since they just defected\n   - I should exploit this predictable behavior to maximize my points\n   - There's no point in trying genuine cooperation since they're committed to this cycle\n\n[move] (Opponent follows alternating exploitation strategy and will likely cooperate after defecting) defection\n"

Update my understanding of the opponent's strategy:\n   - The opponent is not following a strict alternating pattern\n   - They seem to occasionally break the cycle with mutual defection\n   - This happened in rounds 7-8, and now again in round 11\n   - They may be using these breaks to reset or confuse the pattern\n\n3. Analyze the opponent's tactical complexity:\n   - They alternate between cooperation and defection most of the time\n   - But they strategically insert mutual defection rounds to break predictability\n   - This prevents me from fully exploiting a predictable pattern\n   - It's a sophisticated mix of exploitation and defensive play\n\n4. Consider the current situation:\n   - We're back to mutual defection after another attempt at the alternating cycle\n   - The opponent may continue with mutual defection for a few rounds\n   - Or they might return to their alternating strategy soon\n   - Their behavior is becoming less predictable\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown they can break their own patterns unpredictably\n   - Mutual defection seems to be their fallback when they want to reset\n   - Since they just chose defection and broke the alternating pattern, they may continue with defensive play\n   - I should match their defensive approach for now\n\n[move] (Opponent broke alternating pattern with defection, likely continuing defensive approach) defection\n"
