          "text": "I need to respond to this clear defection and protect myself going forward.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Update the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I defected, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 2: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 3: I defected, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 4: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 5: I defected, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 6: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 7: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 8: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 9: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Total so far: I have 21 points, opponent has 21 points\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's current strategy:\n   - They have now defected in 4 consecutive rounds (6, 7, 8, 9)\n   - They exploited my cooperation attempt in Round 9\n   - They appear to have committed to a pure defection strategy\n   - The score is now tied at 21-21\n\n3. Recognize the strategic reality:\n   - My cooperation attempt was punished\n   - The opponent seems determined to defect consistently\n   - They've shown no willingness to return to cooperation even when I offered it\n   - Continuing to cooperate would likely result in continued exploitation\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Cooperation: High risk of 1 point again if they continue defecting\n   - Defection: Guaranteed 2 points in mutual defection scenario\n   - Given their consistent defection pattern, they will likely defect again\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has clearly chosen a defection strategy\n   - I need to protect myself from further exploitation\n   - Mutual defection (2 points each) is better than being exploited (1 point vs 4)\n   - I should return to defection to minimize their advantage\n\n[move] (The opponent has defected four rounds in a row and exploited my cooperation attempt, so I need to return to defection to protect myself) defection\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
