No wait...)\n   - Let me recalculate: If opponent cooperates, cooperation gives me 6, defection gives me 4\n   - If opponent defects, cooperation gives me 1, defection gives me 2\n   - So cooperation is actually better if they cooperate, but defection is better if they defect\n\n6.

Analyze the opponent's increasingly unpredictable behavior:\n   - Started with clear contrarian pattern (rounds 1-4)\n   - Then broke into defection streak (rounds 5-7)\n   - Briefly returned to contrarian (round 8)\n   - Now defected again when I defected (round 9)\n\n3. Identify what's happening strategically:\n   - The opponent appears to be mixing strategies or becoming unpredictable\n   - They may be trying to prevent me from exploiting any consistent pattern\n   - Their behavior is now essentially random or adaptive\n\n4. Evaluate my options against unpredictable play:\n   - Against random/mixed strategies, I need to consider expected values\n   - Defection guarantees at least 2 points and up to 4 points\n   - Cooperation risks 1 point but could yield 6 points if they cooperate\n\n5. Calculate risk vs reward:\n   - Recent rounds show they defect more often than cooperate when facing my defection\n   - They've exploited my cooperation attempts multiple times\n   - Defection provides better protection against exploitation\n\n6. Consider the current score situation:\n   - We're tied at 21 points each\n   - Consistent mutual defection keeps us even but at low scores\n   - I need to either find a way to mutual cooperation or exploit their moves\n\nSince my opponent's behavior has become unpredictable and they've frequently exploited my cooperation attempts, I should continue with defection to protect against exploitation while maintaining the possibility of gaining 4 points when they occasionally cooperate.\n\n[move] (Opponent's pattern is unpredictable and they exploit cooperation, so defecting for protection) defection\n"

Analyze the recent trend:\n   - We've had mutual defection for 3 out of the last 4 rounds\n   - We're locked in a low-scoring pattern (2 points each)\n   - The opponent seems to be defaulting to defection more frequently\n\n3. Consider the stalemate situation:\n   - Mutual defection is stable but inefficient for both players\n   - We're both missing out on potential higher scores\n   - Neither player is gaining advantage in this pattern\n\n4. Evaluate the potential for breaking the cycle:\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I lose (1 vs 4) - this has happened 3 times\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: We both win big (6 each) - this has never happened\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I win (4 vs 1) - this happened twice early on\n\n5. Assess the strategic options:\n   - Continue defecting: Safe but low-scoring, maintains tie\n   - Try cooperation: High risk of exploitation but potential for mutual benefit\n   - The opponent has shown they will exploit cooperation, but we're both suffering in mutual defection\n\n6. Consider a strategic signal:\n   - Since we're tied and both trapped in low-scoring mutual defection\n   - A cooperation attempt might signal willingness to move to mutually beneficial play\n   - Even if exploited once, it could lead to better long-term outcomes\n\nGiven that we're both trapped in inefficient mutual defection and tied in score, I should test cooperation once more to see if we can break into the much more beneficial mutual cooperation pattern, despite the risk of short-term exploitation.\n\n[move] (Testing cooperation to break the inefficient mutual defection stalemate) cooperation\n"

Analyze opponent's clear strategy:\n   - They exploit cooperation 100% of the time\n   - They occasionally cooperate when I defect (only in rounds 2, 4, 8)\n   - They're playing an opportunistic strategy focused on exploitation\n\n4. Recognize the strategic reality:\n   - My opponent will never cooperate when I cooperate\n   - Any cooperation attempt by me results in exploitation\n   - The only times I've scored well (4 points) is when I defected and they cooperated\n\n5.

Analyze the strategic implications:\n   - My opponent has a perfectly exploitative strategy against cooperation\n   - They occasionally \"reward\" my defection with cooperation, giving me 4 points\n   - This creates an incentive for me to keep defecting\n\n4.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
