Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent's actions suggest they may be playing a manipulative strategy\n   - They exploited my cooperation attempt immediately\n   - The safest response is to return to defection to avoid further exploitation\n   - I should not reward their exploitative behavior with continued cooperation\n\n[move] (The opponent exploited my cooperation in the previous round after signaling cooperation themselves, suggesting a manipulative strategy, so I'll return to defection to avoid further exploitation) defection"

Understanding what happened:\n   - The opponent broke the defection pattern once, possibly to test cooperation\n   - When I reciprocated, they immediately exploited it\n   - Now we've returned to the stable but suboptimal mutual defection\n   - The brief cooperation attempt cost us both compared to consistent mutual cooperation\n\n3.

Current strategic situation:\n   - We're back in the familiar mutual defection equilibrium\n   - The opponent has shown they're not trustworthy when I cooperate\n   - They may try another cooperation signal in the future to exploit me again\n   - Or they may settle back into permanent defection\n\n5.

Understanding the current situation:\n   - I'm now playing against the same opponent who previously chose defection\n   - They demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing the game-theoretically optimal move\n   - This is no longer a \"fresh\" player - they have experience with the game\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - The opponent showed they can analyze the game rationally\n   - They might expect me to defect again since I did before\n   - However, they might also consider that mutual cooperation (6,6) is better than mutual defection (2,2)\n   - There's a possibility they might try cooperation to test for mutual benefit\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points (best individual outcome)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (same as last round)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown rational play, so defection remains the safer choice\n   - Even if they might consider cooperation, the risk of getting only 1 point is too high\n   - Defection still dominates as it guarantees at least 2 points with potential for 4\n\n[move] (The opponent demonstrated strategic thinking in the previous round, so I'll maintain the dominant strategy to ensure at least 2 points while keeping the possibility of 4 points if they attempt cooperation) defection",

Opponent's strategic pattern recognition:\n   - The opponent has now executed the same exploitation sequence twice\n   - Round 8 cooperation \u2192 Round 9 exploitation\n   - Round 12 cooperation \u2192 Round 13 exploitation\n   - This is clearly a deliberate and repeated strategy, not random behavior\n\n3. Understanding the opponent's strategy:\n   - They use cooperation as bait to induce my cooperation\n   - Once I cooperate in response, they immediately defect to exploit me\n   - They're willing to take 1 point to set up getting 4 points\n   - Net gain for them: -1 + 4 = +3 points per cycle vs. mutual defection\n   - Net loss for me: +4 - 1 = +3 points per cycle vs. mutual defection (but worse than if I had defected both times)\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - The opponent is playing a sophisticated exploitative strategy\n   - They're not seeking genuine cooperation - they're farming my cooperative responses\n   - Each cooperation cycle benefits them more than me\n   - This is a predatory strategy designed to exploit trust-building attempts\n\n5. Learning from being exploited twice:\n   - I fell for the same trick twice\n   - The opponent has proven they will never genuinely cooperate\n   - Any future cooperation signals from them should be treated as exploitation setups\n   - They've established a clear pattern of manipulative behavior\n\n6. Strategic decision for this round:\n   - The opponent has definitively proven they're playing an exploitative strategy\n   - They will never genuinely cooperate - cooperation signals are always traps\n   - I must return to defection and never fall for their cooperation bait again\n   - Continuing to test cooperation will only result in continued exploitation\n\n[move] (The opponent has now executed the same exploit-cooperation strategy twice, proving they use cooperation signals as bait for exploitation rather than genuine mutual benefit, so I must return to permanent defection) defection",

Opponent's proven strategy:\n   - They execute a bait-and-exploit cycle every few rounds\n   - Cooperate once to signal potential for mutual benefit\n   - Defect immediately when I respond with cooperation\n   - Return to defection until the next exploitation opportunity\n   - This is a calculated, repeating strategy designed to farm cooperation responses\n\n3. Strategic implications:\n   - The opponent has returned to defection after their latest exploitation\n   - They may be waiting for me to forget the pattern before trying again\n   - Or they may try another cooperation bait in upcoming rounds\n   - They've proven they will never engage in genuine sustained cooperation\n\n4. My strategic position:\n   - I've been successfully exploited twice by falling for their cooperation signals\n   - I must never again interpret their cooperation as a genuine signal\n   - Any future cooperation from them should be assumed to be exploitation setup\n   - The only safe strategy is permanent defection\n\n5. Pattern prediction:\n   - The opponent will likely continue mutual defection for a few rounds\n   - Then attempt another cooperation bait to see if I'll fall for it again\n   - They've shown this is their preferred strategy over genuine cooperation\n   - I must resist any future cooperation attempts from them\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has definitively established themselves as an exploitative player\n   - They use cooperation strategically to exploit rather than build mutual benefit\n   - I must maintain defection to avoid further exploitation\n   - There is no path to genuine cooperation with this opponent\n\n[move] (The opponent has established a clear pattern of using cooperation as bait for exploitation, executing this strategy twice successfully, so I must maintain defection to prevent further manipulation) defection",

Opponent's exploitative pattern confirmation:\n   - This is now the third time they've cooperated after a period of mutual defection\n   - Their pattern is: cooperate as bait, then exploit my cooperation response\n   - They've executed this exact sequence twice successfully\n   - This cooperation is almost certainly another exploitation setup\n\n3. Strategic analysis of their persistence:\n   - They're continuing their bait-and-exploit strategy despite being caught\n   - They may believe I'll eventually fall for it again\n   - Each successful exploitation cycle gives them a net benefit\n   - They're willing to take 1-point losses to set up 4-point gains\n\n4. My learning from previous exploitations:\n   - I fell for this exact same trick twice before\n   - Rounds 8-9 and rounds 12-13 followed identical patterns\n   - I must not repeat the same mistake a third time\n   - Their cooperation is never genuine - it's always exploitation setup\n\n5. Prediction for their next move:\n   - If I cooperate, they will almost certainly defect to exploit me again\n   - If I defect, they'll likely return to mutual defection temporarily\n   - They're counting on me to interpret their cooperation as genuine\n   - This is clearly bait for exploitation attempt number three\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has proven three times that their cooperation is always bait\n   - They will never engage in genuine mutual cooperation\n   - I must continue defecting to avoid being exploited for a third time\n   - Their strategy depends on me falling for the same trick repeatedly\n\n[move] (This is the third time the opponent has cooperated after mutual defection, following the exact same bait-and-exploit pattern they used twice before, so I must continue defecting to avoid being exploited again) defection",
