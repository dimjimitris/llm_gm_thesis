    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: I get 6 points, opponent gets 6 points\n   - Both defect: I get 2 points, opponent gets 2 points\n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1 point, opponent gets 4 points\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 4 points, opponent gets 1 point\n\n2. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - If I assume the opponent will cooperate, defecting gives me 4 points vs 6 points for cooperating\n   - If I assume the opponent will defect, defecting gives me 2 points vs 1 point for cooperating\n   - So defection dominates cooperation from a pure self-interest perspective\n\n3. Consider that this is against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player might be more likely to cooperate initially\n   - They may not have developed a defensive strategy yet\n   - This could be an opportunity to gain an advantage\n\n4. Evaluate the risk-reward:\n   - Cooperating risks getting only 1 point if they defect\n   - Defecting guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4\n   - The worst outcome from defecting (2 points) is better than the worst outcome from cooperating (1 point)\n\n5. Make the strategic decision:\n   - Since this is about maximizing my points, and defection provides better guaranteed outcomes regardless of opponent's choice, defection is the rational choice\n\n[move] I choose defection to maximize my expected points given the payoff structure.\n"
