Analyze the opponent's latest move:\n   - After exploiting my cooperation in round 3, they switched back to cooperation\n   - This is surprising - they offered cooperation right after I was likely to defect\n   - They might be trying to establish a pattern of alternating or testing my response\n   - Or they could be signaling a genuine desire to move toward mutual cooperation\n\n3.

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I tried to break the cycle by cooperating\n   - The opponent exploited my cooperation by defecting\n   - They got revenge for round 1 by doing exactly what I did to them\n   - We're now tied at 7 points each\n\n3. Understand the opponent's strategy:\n   - They appear to be playing a \"tit-for-tat with punishment\" strategy\n   - They retaliated after I betrayed their initial cooperation\n   - When I tried to cooperate, they took advantage to even the score\n   - They seem focused on not being exploited again\n\n4. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - They just got their revenge and evened the score\n   - They might now be willing to cooperate since they've \"taught me a lesson\"\n   - Or they might continue defecting, expecting me to defect in response\n   - Their behavior suggests they're strategic and reactive\n\n5. Consider my options:\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 4 points for me (but continues the cycle)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points each (back to stalemate)\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 6 points each (optimal outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point for me (just got burned this way)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown they punish betrayal but might cooperate after evening the score\n   - However, I just got exploited when I tried cooperation\n   - Given their strategic nature, defection seems safer to avoid being exploited again\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given that my opponent just exploited my cooperation attempt, I need to protect myself from further exploitation.\n\n[move] (My opponent just exploited my cooperation attempt, so I need to protect myself from being taken advantage of again) defection",

Analyze the opponent's latest move:\n   - After exploiting my cooperation in round 3, they switched back to cooperation\n   - This is surprising - they offered cooperation right after I was likely to defect\n   - They might be trying to establish a pattern of alternating or testing my response\n   - Or they could be signaling a genuine desire to move toward mutual cooperation\n\n3. Recognize the current dynamic:\n   - I'm now ahead 11-8 in total points\n   - The opponent has shown they can be both retaliatory and forgiving\n   - They seem to be testing different strategies rather than being purely vindictive\n   - This latest cooperation attempt suggests they want to break the cycle\n\n4. Consider the opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They might think: \"I got my revenge, now let's try to cooperate for mutual benefit\"\n   - They could be testing if I'll cooperate after they showed good faith\n   - They might be trying to establish a new cooperative equilibrium\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I defect and they cooperate again: 4 more points (but continues exploitation)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points each (back to mutual punishment)\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point (risky but they just cooperated)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just extended an olive branch by cooperating\n   - They've shown they can retaliate when betrayed, so they're not naive\n   - Since they chose cooperation despite my likely defection, they may genuinely want mutual cooperation\n   - I should reciprocate to see if we can achieve the optimal 6-6 outcome\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent just offered cooperation despite expecting my defection, which suggests genuine intent to establish mutual cooperation for better outcomes.\n\n[move] (My opponent just offered cooperation when they could have expected defection, so I'll reciprocate to try establishing mutual cooperation) cooperation",

Identify the clear pattern that has emerged:\n   - The opponent is playing a consistent strategy of exploiting cooperation\n   - Every time I cooperate, they defect (rounds 3 and 5)\n   - Every time I defect after being exploited, they cooperate (rounds 4)\n   - They're essentially alternating: cooperate to bait me, then defect to exploit me\n\n3. Understand the opponent's strategy:\n   - This is a calculated exploitation strategy\n   - They offer cooperation as bait, then defect when I reciprocate\n   - They're not interested in mutual cooperation - they want to maximize their own points\n   - The pattern shows: they cooperate after I defect, then defect when I cooperate\n\n4. Analyze the current situation:\n   - We're now tied at 12 points each\n   - The opponent has successfully exploited me twice when I tried to cooperate\n   - Based on the pattern, they will likely cooperate this round (since I just cooperated and they defected)\n   - They expect me to defect in response to being exploited\n\n5. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If they cooperate (as pattern suggests) and I defect: 4 points for me\n   - If they cooperate and I cooperate: 6 points each (but they've shown they won't sustain this)\n   - If they defect and I defect: 2 points each\n   - If they defect and I cooperate: 1 point for me (already been burned twice)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown a clear exploitative pattern\n   - They are not genuinely interested in mutual cooperation\n   - Based on their pattern, they should cooperate this round\n   - I should defect to take advantage of their predictable pattern and protect myself\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: My opponent has established a clear pattern of exploitation - I need to defect to counter their predictable strategy and avoid being exploited again.\n\n[move] (My opponent has shown a clear pattern of exploiting my cooperation attempts, so I must defect to counter their predictable strategy) defection",

Analyze the pattern disruption:\n   - The opponent's previous pattern was: cooperate after I defect, defect when I cooperate\n   - But in round 6, they defected when I defected (breaking their pattern)\n   - This suggests they may have abandoned their alternating exploitation strategy\n   - They might now be playing pure defection or have shifted strategies\n\n3. Consider why the opponent changed strategy:\n   - They may have realized I caught onto their pattern\n   - They might be switching to mutual defection to avoid being exploited themselves\n   - Or they could be testing a new approach after the pattern was disrupted\n\n4. Evaluate the current dynamic:\n   - We're still tied at 14 points each\n   - We just had mutual defection (2 points each)\n   - The opponent's behavior is now less predictable since they broke their pattern\n   - They might continue defecting to avoid being exploited\n\n5.

Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown they prioritize exploitation over mutual cooperation\n   - Even when their pattern was disrupted, they chose defection\n   - Given their history of exploiting cooperation, they're unlikely to cooperate genuinely\n   - Defection remains the safer choice to avoid being exploited\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given my opponent's history of exploitation and their recent shift to defection, I should continue defecting to protect myself from being exploited.\n\n[move] (My opponent has consistently exploited cooperation and recently shifted to defection, so I need to protect myself) defection",
