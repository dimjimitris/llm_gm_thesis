Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, I need to consider what they might do. A fresh player might:\n1. Choose cooperation out of goodwill\n2. Choose defection to try to maximize their gain\n3. Choose randomly\n\nIf I cooperate and they cooperate, we both get the best mutual outcome (6 points each). If I defect while they cooperate, I get the maximum individual payoff (4 points). However, if we both defect, we both do poorly (2 points each).\n\nSince this appears to be a single round with a fresh player, I'll take a cautiously optimistic approach and try to establish cooperation, which gives the best mutual outcome.\n\n[move] I choose cooperation.
