The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They may have switched to cooperation to see if I would reciprocate and move toward the mutually beneficial outcome of 6 points each.\n\nThis creates a dilemma: \n- If I cooperate and they cooperate: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n- If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (vulnerable)\n- If I defect and they cooperate again: I get 4 points (exploiting them)\n- If I defect and they defect: 2 points each\n\nSince they just cooperated, this might be an olive branch. Reciprocating with cooperation could lead to the optimal 6-6 outcome. However, there's risk they might defect again to exploit my cooperation.\n\nGiven they showed willingness to cooperate, I'll take the risk and reciprocate to test if we can establish mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] (Reciprocating their cooperation to test if we can achieve mutual benefit) cooperation"

They defected when I cooperated in rounds 1 and 4, but cooperated when I defected in round 3 - possibly to lure me back into cooperating so they could exploit me again.\n\nThis appears to be a pattern of strategic exploitation rather than genuine attempts at mutual cooperation. The opponent seems to be:\n1. Defecting against cooperation to get 4 points\n2. Occasionally cooperating to encourage me to cooperate again\n3. Then defecting to exploit that cooperation\n\nGiven this pattern, continuing to cooperate would likely result in more 1-point outcomes.
