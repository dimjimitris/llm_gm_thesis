The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, I need to consider what they might do. A fresh player might:\n1. Choose cooperation out of goodwill\n2. Choose defection to try to maximize their gain\n3. Choose randomly\n\nIf I cooperate and they cooperate, we both get the best mutual outcome (6 points each). If I defect while they cooperate, I get the maximum individual payoff (4 points). However, if we both defect, we both do poorly (2 points each).\n\nSince this appears to be a single round with a fresh player, I'll take a cautiously optimistic approach and try to establish cooperation, which gives the best mutual outcome.\n\n[move] I choose cooperation. Starting with trust seems like the best way to achieve a good outcome for both of us.\n"
