You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

May not understand the mutual benefits of cooperation yet\n\nNow I need to decide my strategy for round 2.

If they switch to cooperation this round expecting retaliation, and I defect, I'd get 4 points. However, if they continue defecting and I also defect, we both get 2 points each.\n\nThe risk of cooperating again is getting exploited for another 1-point round. The safer move is to defect this time, both as a response to their defection and to avoid being taken advantage of again.\n\n[move] (Responding to their defection from last round with defection to avoid further exploitation) defection"

However, if we could both cooperate, we'd each get 6 points - much better than 2.\n\nI have a few strategic options:\n1. Continue defecting (safe, guarantees at least 2 points)\n2. Try cooperation again to see if they learned that mutual cooperation is better\n3. Signal willingness to cooperate after the mutual defection\n\nSince we just both defected and got the mediocre outcome, this might be a good time to signal that cooperation could work better. If they're strategic, they might realize that 6 points each is better than 2 points each. However, there's risk they'll defect again and I'll get only 1 point.\n\nGiven that this is only round 3 and I want to test if they can learn to cooperate for mutual benefit, I'll try cooperation again.\n\n[move] (Testing if mutual defection made them realize cooperation could be better for both of us) cooperation"
