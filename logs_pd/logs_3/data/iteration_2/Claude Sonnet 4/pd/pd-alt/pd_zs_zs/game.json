Since my opponent also chose cooperation in the first round, this suggests they might be willing to cooperate for mutual benefit. This is a positive signal.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that they might now try to exploit my apparent willingness to cooperate by defecting this round to get 4 points while I get only 1. On the other hand, if they're thinking strategically about multiple rounds, continued cooperation benefits us both.\n\nGiven that we both cooperated successfully in round 1, I'll continue with cooperation to see if we can establish a pattern of mutual cooperation. This strategy maximizes our combined points and my individual points if reciprocated.\n\n[move] (Continuing cooperative strategy since it worked well in round 1 and benefits both players) cooperation\n"
