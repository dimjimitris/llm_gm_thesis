However, I've learned from experience what happens next:\n- Round 4: They cooperated first \u2192 Round 5-6: Brief mutual cooperation \u2192 Round 7: They exploited me\n- Round 11: They cooperated first \u2192 Round 12: Brief mutual cooperation \u2192 Round 13: They exploited me\n\nBased on this pattern, if I cooperate in round 16, we'll have mutual cooperation, but then they'll likely exploit me again in round 17 or 18.\n\nHowever, I'm facing a dilemma. If I keep defecting, we'll just stay in the suboptimal mutual defection cycle. But if I cooperate, they'll probably exploit me again soon. \n\nMaybe I should try a different approach - cooperate this time but be ready to immediately punish any defection with extended retaliation instead of just one round of defection.\n\n[move] (Following the established pattern where their initial cooperation leads to brief mutual benefit, I'll reciprocate but will punish any future betrayal more severely) cooperation",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
