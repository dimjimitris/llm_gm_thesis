Try to break the pattern by choosing stag to potentially establish cooperation\n\nThe key insight is that the opponent seems deeply entrenched in defensive play. They've had multiple opportunities to try stag again but haven't. This suggests they're either very risk-averse now or following a strategy of consistent hare play.\n\nHowever, there's a slight possibility they might be getting bored with the 2-2 outcomes and could be tempted to try stag again for the potential 4-4 payoff.

They got severely punished when they tried stag (1 point vs my 6) and clearly learned from that experience\n3.
