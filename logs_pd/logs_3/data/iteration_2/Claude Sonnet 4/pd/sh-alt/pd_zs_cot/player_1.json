Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the completely entrenched pattern:\n   - The opponent has now chosen hare in 8 consecutive rounds after Round 2\n   - This is an extraordinarily consistent pattern showing total commitment to safe play\n   - They've demonstrated complete unwillingness to risk cooperation again\n   - The pattern is now statistically overwhelming\n\n3. Re-examine the strategic landscape:\n   - At this point, the opponent's behavior is as predictable as any human behavior can be\n   - They learned their lesson in Round 2 and have never deviated since\n   - My hare strategy continues to be optimal against their established play\n   - The game has essentially solved itself into a stable equilibrium\n\n4. Consider if anything could change the dynamic:\n   - 8 rounds of identical behavior suggests deep commitment to this strategy\n   - No external factors have changed the game structure\n   - My consistent success reinforces that my approach is correct\n   - The opponent has shown no signs of strategic adaptation\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Continue with the mathematically optimal strategy\n   - The opponent's 8-round pattern makes their next move highly predictable\n   - My approach has yielded excellent results (averaging 2.44 points per round)\n   - No reason to abandon a winning strategy\n\n[move] (After 8 consecutive hare choices, the opponent's strategy is locked in stone) hare\n"

Analyze the absolutely consistent pattern:\n   - The opponent has now chosen hare in 9 consecutive rounds after Round 2\n   - This represents the strongest possible behavioral pattern in game theory\n   - They have completely locked into defensive play with zero deviation\n   - The predictability is now at maximum certainty\n\n3. Consider a strategic shift possibility:\n   - With 9 straight hare choices, I could reasonably assume they'll choose hare again\n   - If I choose stag against their expected hare, I get 1 point vs my usual 2\n   - Even if they somehow chose stag, mutual stag gives 4 points vs the 6 I'd get with hare\n   - Mathematically, hare still dominates regardless of their choice\n\n4. Evaluate the risk-reward one final time:\n   - Probability opponent chooses hare: ~99% based on pattern\n   - Probability opponent chooses stag: ~1% (would be shocking deviation)\n   - Expected value of my hare: (0.99 \u00d7 2) + (0.01 \u00d7 6) = 2.04 points\n   - Expected value of my stag: (0.99 \u00d7 1) + (0.01 \u00d7 4) = 1.03 points\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Even with generous assumptions, hare remains superior\n   - The opponent's 9-round commitment shows they won't change\n   - My strategy has been exceptionally successful\n   - Continue with the dominant approach\n\n[move] (Nine consecutive hare choices confirm the opponent's complete commitment to defensive play) hare\n"

Consider the theoretical possibility of change:\n   - After 10 identical choices, the opponent has shown they will not deviate\n   - They've had countless opportunities to try cooperation but refuse to risk it\n   - Their single experience with exploitation in Round 2 has permanently shaped their behavior\n   - Any rational analysis would conclude they're locked into hare permanently\n\n4.
