This gives me some information about their strategy.\n\nSince we both played it safe last round, there are a few possibilities:\n1. My opponent is also risk-averse and will continue choosing hare\n2. My opponent might now try stag, thinking I'll stick with the safe hare choice\n3. My opponent might continue with hare since it worked (no major loss)\n\nGiven that we're both \"learning\" each other's tendencies, and my opponent showed they're cautious like me, I think there's a reasonable chance they might stick with hare again. However, there's also a possibility they might switch to stag expecting me to play hare.\n\nI'll take a calculated risk this time - if my opponent continues being cautious with hare, we both get 2 points again. But if they switch to stag (perhaps trying to achieve the cooperative outcome), I'll get the maximum 6 points.\n\n[move] (My opponent showed caution last round, so there's a good chance they'll play hare again, giving me 6 points, or they might play stag expecting cooperation, which still gives me 6 points) hare\n"

They might try to \"punish\" me by playing hare, expecting me to play stag\n\nGiven that my opponent just experienced the worst outcome (1 point), they're likely to either:\n- Play it safe with hare to avoid getting burned again\n- Try stag one more time hoping for cooperation\n\nIf they play hare (being cautious after the bad result), we both get 2 points.\nIf they play stag again (hoping for cooperation), I can either:\n- Choose stag for mutual 4 points\n- Choose hare for another 6 points (but this might seem exploitative)\n\nSince I just got 6 points and my opponent got burned, it might be time to show some cooperation to build trust and achieve the mutually beneficial outcome.

They might be thinking:\n1. If I stick with stag (hoping to cooperate), they can continue exploiting with hare\n2. If I switch back to hare, we're back to the safe but lower payoff\n\nGiven that my opponent just succeeded with hare and might expect me to either:\n- Try stag again (which they can exploit)\n- Switch to hare (mutual 2 points)\n\nI think they might stick with hare for another guaranteed good outcome, or they might try stag if they think I'll go back to hare after getting burned.\n\nI'll go back to the safer hare strategy.
