The key insight is that choosing stag requires coordination - it only pays off well if both players choose it. Choosing hare is safer since it guarantees at least 2 points, with a chance for 6 if the opponent goes for stag.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who may not have experience with this game, they might be more likely to play it safe with hare, or they might go for the cooperative stag option without considering the risk.\n\nGiven the uncertainty about their strategy and the fact that hare gives me either 2 points (if they also choose hare) or 6 points (if they choose stag), while stag could give me either 4 points (if they choose stag) or only 1 point (if they choose hare), I'll play the safer option that also has high upside potential.\n\n[move] (Playing safe against an unknown opponent while maintaining upside potential) hare",

They know I chose hare last time, so they might:\n1. Stick with hare again, thinking it's a safe strategy\n2. Switch to stag, thinking I might switch to stag for the mutual benefit\n3. Try to predict my move based on the previous round\n\nSince we both played hare and got 2 points each, there's a chance they might now consider the stag option for the higher mutual payoff of 4 points each. However, this requires trust and coordination.\n\nGiven that this is only the second round and I still don't have enough information about their long-term strategy, I think there's still significant risk in choosing stag.
