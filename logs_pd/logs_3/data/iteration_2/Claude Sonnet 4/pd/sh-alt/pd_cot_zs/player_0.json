Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with coordination and risk elements\n   - Stag is the cooperative move that requires mutual trust (both get 4)\n   - Hare is the safe/selfish move that guarantees at least 2 points\n   - If I can predict opponent will choose stag, I should choose hare for maximum points (6)\n   - If I think opponent will choose hare, I should also choose hare to avoid getting only 1 point\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often choose the safer option (hare) to avoid worst-case scenarios\n   - Fresh players may not trust others to cooperate initially\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Choosing stag: Risk getting only 1 point if opponent chooses hare, but could get 4 if they cooperate\n   - Choosing hare: Guaranteed at least 2 points, with potential for 6 if opponent chooses stag\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   Given that the opponent is fresh and likely risk-averse, they will probably choose hare. Therefore, I should choose hare to either get 2 points (if they also choose hare) or 6 points (if they surprisingly choose stag).\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose stag despite being \"fresh\" - shows they're willing to trust or take risks\n   - They got burned with only 1 point, which might make them reconsider their strategy\n   - They might now switch to hare for safety, or double down on stag expecting me to cooperate\n\n3. Consider psychological factors:\n   - The opponent just experienced the worst outcome (1 point while I got 6)\n   - This could make them either:\n     a) More cautious and likely to choose hare next time\n     b) Resentful and wanting to \"punish\" me by choosing hare to deny me easy points\n     c) Still believing in cooperation and choosing stag again\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If opponent switches to hare (most likely): I should choose hare to get 2 points rather than risk 1\n   - If opponent sticks with stag: I could choose hare again for 6 points, or choose stag for mutual 4 points\n\n5.

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 6, opponent got 1\n   - Round 2: Both chose hare \u2192 Both got 2 points  \n   - Round 3: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 6, opponent got 1\n   - Round 4-9: All both chose hare \u2192 Both got 2 points each round\n   - My total so far: 26 points\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's extremely consistent pattern:\n   - Six consecutive hare choices (rounds 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)\n   - They haven't chosen stag since round 3 (6 rounds ago)\n   - Opponent total: 16 points vs my 26 points\n   - The point gap continues to widen (10-point difference)\n\n3. Consider psychological factors:\n   - The opponent has fully internalized the \"stag is dangerous\" lesson\n   - They may be getting increasingly frustrated with the growing point deficit\n   - Six rounds of safety might make them either more entrenched in hare or more likely to break out\n\n4. Evaluate the decision complexity:\n   - We're in the longest stable hare-hare streak (6 rounds)\n   - The opponent might be thinking: \"When will this player ever cooperate?\"\n   - They could be building up to a stag attempt, or completely resigned to hare\n   - My average points per round remains very strong (~2.89)\n\n5. Strategic risk assessment:\n   - Continuing hare: Guaranteed 2 points, massive 6 points if they try stag\n   - Switching to stag: Catastrophic 1 point if they stick with hare, mutual 4 if they switch\n   - The growing point gap might push them toward a desperate stag attempt\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   The opponent's behavior has been incredibly predictable for 6 straight rounds, but the widening point gap (26 vs 16) creates pressure for them to try something different. If they do attempt stag to either force cooperation or catch me switching, I want to be ready with hare for the 6-point payoff. The risk of switching to stag and getting 1 point while they stick with their established hare pattern is too high.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Consider the strategic implications:\n   - This is now the longest predictable streak in the game\n   - The opponent seems completely committed to the safe hare strategy\n   - They may have given up on trying to optimize and accepted steady 2-point returns\n\n4. Evaluate potential breaking points:\n   - The widening gap (28 vs 18) should theoretically create pressure to change\n   - But 7 consecutive rounds suggests deep behavioral conditioning\n   - They might be waiting for ME to switch to stag first to enable cooperation\n   - Or they might attempt a surprise stag to test if I'll ever deviate\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - My hare strategy has been extraordinarily successful (2.8 points per round average)\n   - The opportunity cost of missing a potential 6-point round is very high\n   - The risk of switching to stag and getting 1 point while they continue hare is devastating\n   - Even mutual cooperation (4-4) isn't dramatically better than my current advantage\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   The opponent has demonstrated incredible consistency with hare for 7 straight rounds, suggesting they're either completely risk-averse or waiting for me to make the first cooperative move. However, the growing point deficit might eventually force their hand. My hare strategy continues to be optimal - it protects against any surprise stag moves while maintaining my significant lead.

Strategic decision:\n   The opponent has demonstrated the most consistent behavioral pattern I've ever seen - 9 straight rounds of hare.
