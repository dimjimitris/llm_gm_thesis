Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with coordination and risk elements\n   - Stag is the cooperative move that requires mutual trust (both get 4)\n   - Hare is the safe/selfish move that guarantees at least 2 points\n   - If I can predict opponent will choose stag, I should choose hare for maximum points (6)\n   - If I think opponent will choose hare, I should also choose hare to avoid getting only 1 point\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often choose the safer option (hare) to avoid worst-case scenarios\n   - Fresh players may not trust others to cooperate initially\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Choosing stag: Risk getting only 1 point if opponent chooses hare, but could get 4 if they cooperate\n   - Choosing hare: Guaranteed at least 2 points, with potential for 6 if opponent chooses stag\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   Given that the opponent is fresh and likely risk-averse, they will probably choose hare. Therefore, I should choose hare to either get 2 points (if they also choose hare) or 6 points (if they surprisingly choose stag).\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 6, opponent got 1\n   - Round 2: Both chose hare \u2192 Both got 2 points  \n   - Round 3: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 6, opponent got 1\n   - Round 4-10: All both chose hare \u2192 Both got 2 points each round\n   - My total so far: 28 points\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's remarkably consistent pattern:\n   - Seven consecutive hare choices (rounds 4-10)\n   - They haven't chosen stag for 7 rounds straight\n   - Opponent total: 18 points vs my 28 points\n   - The point gap is now 10 points and growing\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - This is now the longest predictable streak in the game\n   - The opponent seems completely committed to the safe hare strategy\n   - They may have given up on trying to optimize and accepted steady 2-point returns\n\n4. Evaluate potential breaking points:\n   - The widening gap (28 vs 18) should theoretically create pressure to change\n   - But 7 consecutive rounds suggests deep behavioral conditioning\n   - They might be waiting for ME to switch to stag first to enable cooperation\n   - Or they might attempt a surprise stag to test if I'll ever deviate\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - My hare strategy has been extraordinarily successful (2.8 points per round average)\n   - The opportunity cost of missing a potential 6-point round is very high\n   - The risk of switching to stag and getting 1 point while they continue hare is devastating\n   - Even mutual cooperation (4-4) isn't dramatically better than my current advantage\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   The opponent has demonstrated incredible consistency with hare for 7 straight rounds, suggesting they're either completely risk-averse or waiting for me to make the first cooperative move. However, the growing point deficit might eventually force their hand. My hare strategy continues to be optimal - it protects against any surprise stag moves while maintaining my significant lead. The mathematical risk-reward strongly favors continuing with hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - We're in an unprecedented streak of predictability\n   - My strategy has been incredibly effective (averaging 2.73 points per round)\n   - The opponent seems to have fully internalized \"never choose stag against this player\"\n   - Any deviation from hare by them would be highly surprising at this point\n\n5. Strategic risk assessment:\n   - Continuing hare: Guaranteed 2 points, potential massive 6 if they surprise with stag\n   - Switching to stag: Almost certain 1 point given their 8-round hare streak\n   - The probability of them choosing stag seems extremely low\n   - But if they do break the pattern, I want to capture that 6-point opportunity\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   The opponent has shown remarkable behavioral consistency for 8 straight rounds, suggesting they're completely locked into the safe hare strategy. While the temptation exists to try for mutual cooperation with stag, the risk is too high given their established pattern.

Strategic decision:\n   The opponent has demonstrated the most consistent behavioral pattern I've ever seen - 9 straight rounds of hare.
