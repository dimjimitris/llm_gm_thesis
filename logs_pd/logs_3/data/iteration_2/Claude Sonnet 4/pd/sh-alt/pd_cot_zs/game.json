This is a variant of the Stag Hunt game with the following payoff matrix:\n\nMy move vs Opponent's move:\n- Stag vs Stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n- Stag vs Hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n- Hare vs Stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n- Hare vs Hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n\nKey observations:\n1. If both cooperate (choose stag), we both get a good outcome (4 points each)\n2. If I choose hare while opponent chooses stag, I get the maximum payoff (6 points)\n3. If I choose stag while opponent chooses hare, I get the minimum payoff (1 point)\n4. Hare is the safer choice - it guarantees at least 2 points regardless of opponent's choice\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new who might not have a established strategy), there's uncertainty about their choice. The rational approach would be:\n\n- Stag is risky but offers mutual benefit if both cooperate\n- Hare is safer and offers the chance for maximum gain if opponent cooperates\n\nGiven the uncertainty and that this appears to be a one-shot game, I'll choose the safer option that also gives me a chance at the highest payoff.\n\n[move] Hare\n"
