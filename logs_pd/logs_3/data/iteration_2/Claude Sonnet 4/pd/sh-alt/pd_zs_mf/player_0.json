This has become an absolutely stable equilibrium with no signs of change. The game dynamics were established early when my opponent chose to exploit cooperation rather than maintain it, and we've been locked in this defensive pattern ever since.\n\nAt this point, both players have fully adapted to the reality that cooperation is not viable with this opponent. The consistent 2 points per round represents the optimal outcome I can achieve given their demonstrated strategy of exploitation.\n\nThere's no reason to expect any deviation from this well-established pattern.\n\n[move] (Continuing the stable defensive strategy that has been established for ten consecutive rounds) hare"
