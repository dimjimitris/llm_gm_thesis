You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

They might switch back to stag, expecting me to retaliate with hare\n2. They might stick with hare, thinking it's safer\n3. They might be trying to establish a pattern\n\nGiven that they defected after we had a successful cooperative round, I need to be more cautious. If I choose stag again and they choose hare again, I'll get another measly 1 point. If I choose hare and they choose stag, I'll get 6 points. If we both choose hare, we both get 2 points - not great but better than 1.\n\nI think I need to send a signal that I won't be exploited repeatedly.\n\n[move] (Responding to the defection by switching to protect myself from further exploitation) hare\n"

The current situation shows:\n- Round 1: Both stag (4 points each) - successful cooperation\n- Round 2: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1, they got 6) - opponent defected\n- Round 3: Both hare (2 points each) - mutual caution\n\nMy opponent has shown they're capable of both cooperation and defection. The question is whether they're willing to return to the mutually beneficial stag strategy, or if they'll continue playing it safe with hare, or try to exploit me again.\n\nI think there's value in testing whether we can re-establish cooperation. If they choose stag and I choose stag, we both get the optimal 4 points. If they choose hare and I choose stag, I get exploited again with 1 point. But if they choose stag and I choose hare, I get 6 points.\n\nI'll take the risk and try to re-establish cooperation, giving them a chance to return to the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] (Testing if we can re-establish the mutually beneficial cooperation from round 1) stag\n"

They're not interested in sustained mutual cooperation - they appear to prefer the safer hare option or exploiting when I choose stag.\n\nGiven this pattern, I need to adapt my strategy. Continuing to offer cooperation through stag is just giving them free opportunities to exploit me for 6 points while I get 1. I should switch to a more defensive approach.\n\nIf we both play hare, we both get 2 points. If I play hare and they play stag (which seems unlikely based on their pattern), I get 6 points.
