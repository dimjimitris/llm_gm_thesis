First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with intuition\n   - They might be risk-averse or risk-seeking\n\n3. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I either get 4 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I either get 6 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag is higher risk/higher reward if we cooperate, but terrible if they defect\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and gives a chance for 6 points\n\n5. Against a fresh player who hasn't established trust or patterns, they might be more likely to play it safe or be unpredictable. The hare choice gives me better worst-case scenario (2 vs 1) and best-case scenario (6 vs 4).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should choose the option that gives me better expected value and protects against the worst outcome.\n\n[move] hare"

From the previous round, I learned that:\n   - The other player also chose hare\n   - This suggests they might be thinking similarly to me (risk-averse or going for the safer option)\n   - We both got 2 points\n\n2. Now I need to consider what they might do this round:\n   - They might stick with hare since it worked reasonably well\n   - They might switch to stag, thinking I'll stick with hare (trying to exploit me)\n   - They might think I'll switch to stag and they should too (mutual cooperation)\n\n3. Analyzing the psychology:\n   - Since we both chose hare last time, there's a possibility they're thinking about cooperation now\n   - A fresh player might start to see the pattern that mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the best mutual outcome\n   - However, they might also try to exploit if they think I'll cooperate\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: we both get 4 points (better than last round)\n   - If I choose stag and they stick with hare: I get only 1 point (risky)\n   - If I choose hare and they switch to stag: I get 6 points (excellent)\n   - If we both choose hare again: we both get 2 points (safe but not optimal)\n\n5. The fact that we both chose the same move suggests some alignment in thinking. This might be a good opportunity to try for mutual cooperation.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since we both chose hare last round, showing similar risk assessment, I'll try to establish cooperation by choosing stag this round.\n\n[move] stag"

Pattern analysis of my opponent:\n   - They chose hare in all 3 rounds\n   - They consistently stick with the safer, more defensive option\n   - They exploited my cooperation attempt but then returned to hare\n   - This suggests they might be playing a consistent \"hare-heavy\" strategy\n\n3.

Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If opponent continues with hare (likely based on pattern):\n     - If I choose hare: we both get 2 (safe but doesn't help me catch up)\n     - If I choose stag: I get 1 (terrible, falls further behind)\n   - If opponent switches to stag (less likely but possible):\n     - If I choose hare: I get 6 (excellent, helps me catch up significantly)\n     - If I choose stag: we both get 4 (decent, cooperative)\n\n5.

Strong pattern identification:\n   - Opponent has chosen hare in ALL 4 rounds (100% consistency)\n   - This is no longer just a tendency - it's a very strong behavioral pattern\n   - They seem committed to the safe, defensive strategy\n   - Even when they could have tried to exploit again after round 2, they returned to hare\n\n3.

Strategic reality check:\n   - At this point, the opponent's behavior is as predictable as a mathematical constant\n   - If I choose hare: 2 points (maintains 10-point deficit)\n   - If I choose stag: almost certainly 1 point (increases deficit to 11 points)\n   - There's essentially zero evidence they will ever choose stag\n\n5. Final consideration:\n   - I'm in a losing position that won't change if current patterns continue\n   - However, taking risks has only made things worse (twice)\n   - With 10/10 consistency, betting against their pattern is statistically foolish\n   - The best I can do is maintain the current gap and hope for future opportunities\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has established an absolutely consistent 10/10 hare pattern. Taking any risk at this point would be irrational given the overwhelming evidence.\n\n[move] hare"

Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag is higher risk/higher reward if we cooperate, but terrible if they defect\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and gives a chance for 6 points\n\n5. Against a fresh player who hasn't established trust or patterns, they might be more likely to play it safe or be unpredictable. The hare choice gives me better worst-case scenario (2 vs 1) and best-case scenario (6 vs 4).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should choose the option that gives me better expected value and protects against the worst outcome.\n\n[move] hare",

Strategic gamble assessment:\n   - If I keep choosing hare, I'll likely stay 5 points behind forever\n   - If I choose stag and they stick with hare: I get 1 point (very bad, fall further behind)\n   - If I choose stag and they finally switch to stag: we both get 4 points (helps close gap slightly)\n   - The risk is enormous, but I'm already losing\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'm losing and need to break this pattern. Despite the opponent's perfect 6/6 hare record, I must take a calculated risk to have any chance of winning.\n\n[move] stag",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
