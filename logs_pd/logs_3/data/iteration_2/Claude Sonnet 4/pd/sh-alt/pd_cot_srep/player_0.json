Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Recognize the strategic reality:\n   - Nine consecutive identical outcomes with zero deviation whatsoever\n   - We're both completely entrenched in what game theorists call a \"stable suboptimal equilibrium\"\n   - The cumulative opportunity cost is now 18 points compared to mutual cooperation\n\n3. Evaluate the psychological commitment:\n   - Nine rounds represents an extreme level of behavioral consistency\n   - The opponent has demonstrated they are either completely risk-averse or have settled on hare as their permanent strategy\n   - This pattern is so strong it's become almost mechanical\n\n4. Consider the strategic breaking point:\n   - At nine rounds of identical play, this has moved beyond strategy into pure predictability\n   - If I don't attempt to break this cycle now, we could be locked in this pattern indefinitely\n   - However, the opponent's unwavering commitment makes any deviation extremely risky\n\n5. Analyze the opportunity vs risk:\n   - Continuing with hare: Virtual certainty of 2 points based on overwhelming pattern evidence\n   - Switching to stag: Extremely high probability of only 1 point, small chance of breakthrough to 4 points\n   - The opponent has given absolutely no signal they would ever deviate from hare\n\n6. Consider game theory implications:\n   - After nine identical rounds, both players have essentially \"solved\" the game in the most risk-averse way possible\n   - Breaking unilaterally from such an established pattern is typically irrational\n   - The opponent's behavior suggests they will continue this pattern indefinitely\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Nine rounds of perfect consistency makes the opponent's next move almost mathematically predictable\n   - The risk-reward calculation heavily favors continuing the established safe pattern\n   - Any rational analysis suggests they will choose hare again\n\n[move] (Nine consecutive rounds of hare establishes near-mathematical certainty opponent will choose hare again, maintaining hare ensures guaranteed 2 points) hare\n"
