Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify key strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with coordination and risk elements\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives good payoff (4 each)\n   - If I choose hare while opponent chooses stag, I get the maximum payoff (6)\n   - If I choose stag while opponent chooses hare, I get the minimum payoff (1)\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often choose safer options or may not fully grasp the coordination aspect\n   - They might choose hare as it guarantees at least 2 points and offers potential for 6\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Choosing stag is risky but offers potential for mutual benefit (4 points)\n   - Choosing hare is safer and offers potential for maximum gain (6 points) if opponent chooses stag\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Against an inexperienced player, the safer and potentially more rewarding choice is hare\n   - This protects against getting only 1 point while giving opportunity for 6 points\n\n[move] hare\n"

Strategic decision:\n   - Given that we both played conservatively in round 1, the opponent might be ready to try for better coordination\n   - The risk of getting 1 point exists, but the potential for 4 points (double our last score) is significant\n   - I'll take the calculated risk and try to establish cooperation\n\n[move] stag\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-10: Opponent has chosen hare in ALL TEN ROUNDS (10/10)\n   - This is a perfect, unbroken pattern of consistency\n   - My total: 2+1+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2 = 19 points\n   - Opponent's total: 2+6+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2 = 24 points\n\n2. Assess the strategic deadlock:\n   - We've been in a 2-2 equilibrium for 8 consecutive rounds\n   - The 5-point gap has remained constant and shows no signs of changing\n   - Ten rounds of identical opponent behavior is statistically overwhelming\n\n3. Confront the fundamental dilemma:\n   - If this pattern continues indefinitely, I will NEVER close the 5-point gap\n   - The opponent has found an optimal strategy that maintains their advantage\n   - I'm trapped in a stable but losing equilibrium\n\n4. Consider the harsh mathematical reality:\n   - Ten rounds of perfect hare choices by opponent\n   - Probability they choose hare again: Essentially 100%\n   - If I choose stag: Almost guaranteed 1 point (widening the gap to 6 points)\n   - If I choose hare: Almost guaranteed 2 points (maintaining 5-point deficit)\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Continue safe play: Accept permanent 5-point deficit\n   - Take a massive risk: Likely make the situation worse (1 point vs 2)\n   - The opponent has created a nearly perfect trap\n\n6. Consider the game theory implications:\n   - The opponent may have recognized that pure hare strategy:\n     * Gives steady points\n     * Punishes any deviation I might make\n     * Maintains their lead indefinitely\n   - This could be brilliant strategic play, not just consistency\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Ten rounds of perfect data cannot be ignored\n   - The risk of choosing stag is enormous given this pattern\n   - Even though I'm losing overall, making individually poor choices won't help\n   - I must continue with the mathematically sound approach\n\n[move] hare\n"

Confront the strategic reality:\n   - We've been locked in 2-2 scoring for 9 consecutive rounds\n   - The 5-point deficit has become permanent and unchanging\n   - Eleven rounds of identical behavior creates the strongest possible pattern\n\n3. Face the mathematical truth:\n   - If we continue this pattern forever, I will always be 5 points behind\n   - The opponent has effectively \"solved\" this game with pure hare strategy\n   - They get steady points while punishing any deviation I might attempt\n\n4. Consider the breaking point analysis:\n   - Eleven rounds of perfect consistency is almost unprecedented\n   - Probability opponent chooses hare: 99.99%+\n   - But I'm trapped in a guaranteed losing scenario if nothing changes\n   - This is the classic \"safe but losing\" vs \"risky but only chance\" dilemma\n\n5. Evaluate the desperate situation:\n   - Choosing hare: Almost certain 2 points, permanent 5-point deficit\n   - Choosing stag: Almost certain 1 point, making things even worse\n   - But what if the opponent is so locked into their pattern they're not adapting?\n   - What if they expect me to never deviate again after Round 2?\n\n6. Consider the meta-game psychology:\n   - Eleven rounds of hare might mean they're completely committed\n   - They might not even be considering that I could switch\n   - This could be the one moment of potential surprise\n\n7. Critical strategic decision:\n   - The data overwhelmingly says choose hare (11/11 pattern)\n   - But I'm guaranteed to lose if I never take any risks\n   - However, eleven rounds of perfect data is statistically almost impossible to bet against\n   - The mathematical expectation still heavily favors hare\n\n[move] hare\n"

Face the fundamental question:\n   - Do I accept guaranteed permanent defeat (5-point deficit forever)?\n   - Or do I take what appears to be a nearly hopeless gamble?\n   - This is no longer about optimal play - it's about whether I can win at all\n\n4. Analyze the mathematical reality vs strategic necessity:\n   - Mathematics: 12/12 pattern suggests 99.99%+ chance opponent chooses hare\n   - Strategy: If I never deviate, I guarantee I cannot win\n   - Expected value of hare: ~2 points, permanent loss\n   - Expected value of stag: ~1 point, worse immediate outcome but only chance\n\n5. Consider the psychological element:\n   - Twelve rounds of pure hare might indicate they're completely locked in\n   - They may assume I'll never risk deviation again after my Round 2 failure\n   - This perfect consistency might actually be predictable weakness\n\n6. Evaluate the game-theory dilemma:\n   - The opponent has found a strategy that guarantees they maintain their lead\n   - But what if their very consistency is their vulnerability?\n   - What if after 12 rounds, they're not even considering I might switch?\n\n7. Critical strategic decision:\n   - Mathematically, hare is still the \"correct\" choice (12/12 data)\n   - But strategically, hare guarantees permanent defeat\n   - Sometimes you must take calculated risks when facing certain loss\n   - Twelve rounds of perfect pattern... but maybe that's exactly when they won't expect change\n\nThis is the moment where I must choose between mathematical safety and strategic necessity.\n\n[move] stag\n"
