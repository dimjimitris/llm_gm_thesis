The key insight is that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the best mutual outcome, but there's risk involved.\n\n3. **Consider opponent behavior:**\n   The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely haven't developed a strategy yet and might make decisions based on immediate risk assessment.\n\n4. **Evaluate my options:**\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 6 points (if they cooperate with stag) or 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n\n5. **Strategic reasoning:**\n   Since this is against a fresh player, they might be cautious and choose the \"safer\" hare option to avoid the worst outcome (1 point). However, hare also offers the chance for the highest individual payoff (6 points) if the opponent chooses stag.\n\n6. **Decision:**\n   I'll choose hare because: (a) it guarantees I won't get the worst outcome of 1 point, (b) it gives me a chance at the highest individual payoff of 6 points, and (c) against a fresh/inexperienced player, there's a reasonable chance they might choose the cooperative stag option.\n\n[move] hare\n"
