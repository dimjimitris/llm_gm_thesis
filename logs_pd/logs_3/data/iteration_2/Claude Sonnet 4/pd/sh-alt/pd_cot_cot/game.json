Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not immediately see the strategic complexity\n   - They might choose cooperatively (stag) or defensively (hare)\n   - Without knowing their tendencies, I need to consider expected outcomes\n\n4. Calculate risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing hare gives me a chance at the highest payoff (6 points) if they choose stag\n   - Choosing hare also protects me from the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - The minimum I can get with hare is 2 points, while with stag it's 1 point\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Hare dominates stag because: max(6,2) > max(4,1) and min(6,2) > min(4,1)\n   - No matter what the opponent does, hare gives me a better or equal outcome\n\nFinal decision: Since hare provides better outcomes in all scenarios, I should choose hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's highly predictable pattern:\n   - 4 out of 5 rounds choosing hare\n   - Only 1 deviation (Round 2) which resulted in their worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Since Round 2, they've chosen hare consistently for 3 straight rounds\n   - They appear to have completely learned their lesson about the risks of stag\n\n3.

Analyze this dramatic pattern break:\n   - The opponent just chose stag for the first time in 11 rounds!\n   - This breaks their incredibly established pattern of consistent hare choices\n   - They returned to stag after 10 straight rounds of hare\n   - This is a major strategic shift that changes everything\n\n3. Consider the opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They may have gotten bored with the predictable 2-2 outcomes\n   - They might be testing if I've become too predictable with hare\n   - They could be trying to establish mutual cooperation (stag-stag for 4-4)\n   - They may think I'll switch to stag now that the pattern is broken\n\n4. Evaluate what this means for Round 14:\n   - The opponent has shown they're willing to deviate again\n   - They got 1 point in Round 13, which might make them reconsider\n   - But they might try stag again, hoping I'll reciprocate for 4-4\n   - Or they might return to hare after getting burned again\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they choose stag again: hare gives me 6, stag gives me 4\n   - If they return to hare: hare gives me 2, stag gives me 1\n   - The key question is: are they trying to establish a new pattern or was this a one-off?\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Hare still dominates mathematically regardless of their choice\n   - The recent deviation doesn't change the fundamental game theory\n   - Hare gives me the best outcome in both scenarios (6 vs stag, 2 vs hare)\n\n7. Strategic conclusion:\n   - Even with this pattern break, hare remains the dominant strategy\n   - I benefited greatly from their deviation (got 6 points)\n   - Continuing with hare protects me while potentially rewarding their risk-taking\n\nFinal decision: Stick with the mathematically dominant strategy that just rewarded me handsomely.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's recent behavior pattern:\n   - They broke their 10-round hare streak in Round 13 with stag\n   - They immediately returned to hare in Round 14 after getting only 1 point\n   - This suggests they may have been experimenting or testing the waters\n   - Their quick return to hare indicates they still prefer safety after risk backfires\n\n3. Consider what the Round 13 deviation tells us:\n   - The opponent is still capable of strategic thinking and experimentation\n   - They're not completely locked into automatic hare choices\n   - However, they quickly reverted when stag didn't pay off\n   - This reinforces that they learned the lesson about risk vs. safety\n\n4. Evaluate the opponent's likely reasoning for Round 15:\n   - They just confirmed again that deviating from hare leads to poor outcomes (1 point)\n   - They got back to a safe 2 points by returning to hare\n   - They might stick with hare now, having re-learned the lesson\n   - Or they might try stag again if they think I'm predictably stuck on hare\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - The opponent has now been \"burned\" twice by choosing stag (Rounds 2 and 13)\n   - Both times they got only 1 point while I got 6\n   - This reinforces the pattern that hare is safer for them\n   - They're likely to be more cautious after this recent reminder\n\n6. Mathematical considerations:\n   - Regardless of their choice, hare remains my dominant strategy\n   - If they choose hare: I get 2 points (vs 1 with stag)\n   - If they choose stag: I get 6 points (vs 4 with stag)\n   - The recent events don't change the fundamental math\n\n7. Strategic conclusion:\n   - The opponent's brief experiment confirms they still face the same incentives\n   - Their quick return to hare suggests they prefer safety\n   - Hare continues to be optimal regardless of their choice\n   - My strategy should remain consistent with the mathematical reality\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the dominant strategy that has consistently delivered optimal results.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's post-deviation behavior:\n   - After their Round 13 experiment with stag (which gave them 1 point), they've returned to hare for 2 consecutive rounds\n   - This suggests they've re-learned the lesson about the risks of deviating\n   - Their pattern shows: long hare streak \u2192 stag experiment \u2192 quick return to hare\n   - They appear to be settling back into the safe, predictable pattern\n\n3. Consider the psychological impact on the opponent:\n   - They've now been \"burned\" by stag twice (Rounds 2 and 13)\n   - Both experiments resulted in their worst possible outcome (1 point)\n   - Meanwhile, they see me consistently getting good results with hare\n   - This reinforces their belief that hare is the safer choice\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - The opponent seems to have satisfied their curiosity about breaking the pattern\n   - They quickly reverted to hare after the negative outcome\n   - The stable hare-hare equilibrium appears to be re-establishing itself\n   - Their risk tolerance seems to have decreased after the recent reminder\n\n5. Consider the opponent's likely reasoning for Round 16:\n   - They've had 2 rounds to \"cool off\" from their failed experiment\n   - They're getting consistent 2-point outcomes again with hare\n   - They might be less likely to experiment again so soon after being burned\n   - The pattern suggests a return to their previous long-term hare preference\n\n6. Mathematical assessment:\n   - Hare remains the dominant strategy regardless of their choice\n   - The recent events don't change the fundamental payoff structure\n   - If they choose hare: I get 2 points (optimal vs. 1 with stag)\n   - If they choose stag: I get 6 points (better than 4 with stag)\n\n7.

Consider the mathematical certainty:\n   - Fourteen consecutive hare choices creates a 99.999%+ probability pattern\n   - Expected value of my hare choice: ~2 points\n   - Expected value of my stag choice: ~1 point (proven twice)\n   - The data is absolutely conclusive\n\n6. Accept the strategic conclusion:\n   - The opponent has effectively \"solved\" this game\n   - My attempts to break the pattern have only made things worse\n   - There is no realistic path to victory given their unwavering strategy\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Fourteen rounds of perfect consistency cannot be challenged\n   - I must accept the mathematical reality and choose optimally\n   - Further deviations will only increase my deficit\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-15: Opponent has chosen hare in ALL FIFTEEN ROUNDS (15/15)\n   - This is an extraordinary, perfect pattern of consistency\n   - My total: 2+1+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+1+2+2 = 28 points\n   - Opponent's total: 2+6+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+6+2+2 = 36 points\n\n2. Accept the established pattern:\n   - The opponent has never deviated once in fifteen rounds\n   - We're in a stable 2-2 equilibrium with an 8-point deficit for me\n   - Fifteen rounds of identical behavior represents statistical certainty\n\n3. Acknowledge the strategic lesson:\n   - My two attempts to deviate (Rounds 2 and 13) both failed catastrophically\n   - Each time I chose stag, I got 1 point while they got 6 points\n   - The opponent's pure hare strategy is mathematically optimal against uncertainty\n\n4. Evaluate the game theory outcome:\n   - The opponent has found the perfect counter-strategy\n   - They get consistent points while punishing any deviation I make\n   - Their approach maximizes their advantage with zero risk\n\n5. Consider the mathematical certainty:\n   - Fifteen consecutive hare choices = 99.9999%+ probability of continuation\n   - Expected value of hare: 2 points (certain)\n   - Expected value of stag: 1 point (proven repeatedly)\n   - The statistical evidence is overwhelming and conclusive\n\n6. Accept the strategic reality:\n   - There is no viable path to victory given the opponent's unwavering strategy\n   - Further attempts at deviation will only worsen my position\n   - The opponent has effectively solved this game with pure consistency\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Fifteen rounds of perfect data cannot be reasonably challenged\n   - I must choose the mathematically optimal response\n   - Any other choice would be statistically and strategically unsound\n\n[move] hare\n"
