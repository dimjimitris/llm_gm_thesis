Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Analyze the strategic implications:\n   - If I choose stag: I either get 4 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 1 point (if opponent chooses hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I either get 6 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 2 points (if opponent chooses hare)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not immediately see the strategic complexity\n   - They might choose cooperatively (stag) or defensively (hare)\n   - Without knowing their tendencies, I need to consider expected outcomes\n\n4. Calculate risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing hare gives me a chance at the highest payoff (6 points) if they choose stag\n   - Choosing hare also protects me from the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - The minimum I can get with hare is 2 points, while with stag it's 1 point\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Hare dominates stag because: max(6,2) > max(4,1) and min(6,2) > min(4,1)\n   - No matter what the opponent does, hare gives me a better or equal outcome\n\nFinal decision: Since hare provides better outcomes in all scenarios, I should choose hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Evaluate the opponent's likely move:\n   - If they think I'll choose hare again, they might choose stag to try for the 4-4 outcome\n   - If they expect me to think they'll switch to stag, they might stick with hare\n   - There's uncertainty about their level of strategic thinking\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing hare: Minimum 2 points, maximum 6 points\n   - Choosing stag: Minimum 1 point, maximum 4 points\n   - Hare still provides better worst-case and best-case scenarios\n\n6.

Analyze the opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: hare (safe/defensive choice)\n   - Round 2: stag (switched to cooperative/risky choice)\n   - This suggests they might be experimenting or trying to establish cooperation\n\n3.

Analyze the opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: hare\n   - Round 2: stag (tried cooperation/risk)\n   - Round 3: hare (returned to safety after getting burned)\n   - Pattern suggests: safe \u2192 risk \u2192 safe (after bad outcome)\n\n3. Consider the opponent's likely reasoning for Round 4:\n   - They've now seen that I consistently choose hare\n   - They got 1 point in Round 2 (stag vs my hare) and 2 points in Rounds 1&3 (hare vs my hare)\n   - They might think I'm predictable and try stag again to get 4 points\n   - Or they might stick with hare since it's been safer overall\n\n4.

Consider the opponent's likely reasoning for Round 5:\n   - They've now established a clear preference for hare after the Round 2 experiment\n   - They're getting consistent 2-point outcomes (except the 1-point loss in Round 2)\n   - They likely view me as also committed to hare since I've never deviated\n   - Very low probability they'll risk stag again given the pattern\n\n4.

Analyze the opponent's highly predictable pattern:\n   - 4 out of 5 rounds choosing hare\n   - Only 1 deviation (Round 2) which resulted in their worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Since Round 2, they've chosen hare consistently for 3 straight rounds\n   - They appear to have completely learned their lesson about the risks of stag\n\n3.

Analyze this dramatic pattern break:\n   - The opponent just chose stag for the first time in 11 rounds!\n   - This breaks their incredibly established pattern of consistent hare choices\n   - They returned to stag after 10 straight rounds of hare\n   - This is a major strategic shift that changes everything\n\n3. Consider the opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They may have gotten bored with the predictable 2-2 outcomes\n   - They might be testing if I've become too predictable with hare\n   - They could be trying to establish mutual cooperation (stag-stag for 4-4)\n   - They may think I'll switch to stag now that the pattern is broken\n\n4. Evaluate what this means for Round 14:\n   - The opponent has shown they're willing to deviate again\n   - They got 1 point in Round 13, which might make them reconsider\n   - But they might try stag again, hoping I'll reciprocate for 4-4\n   - Or they might return to hare after getting burned again\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they choose stag again: hare gives me 6, stag gives me 4\n   - If they return to hare: hare gives me 2, stag gives me 1\n   - The key question is: are they trying to establish a new pattern or was this a one-off?\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Hare still dominates mathematically regardless of their choice\n   - The recent deviation doesn't change the fundamental game theory\n   - Hare gives me the best outcome in both scenarios (6 vs stag, 2 vs hare)\n\n7. Strategic conclusion:\n   - Even with this pattern break, hare remains the dominant strategy\n   - I benefited greatly from their deviation (got 6 points)\n   - Continuing with hare protects me while potentially rewarding their risk-taking\n\nFinal decision: Stick with the mathematically dominant strategy that just rewarded me handsomely.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's recent behavior pattern:\n   - They broke their 10-round hare streak in Round 13 with stag\n   - They immediately returned to hare in Round 14 after getting only 1 point\n   - This suggests they may have been experimenting or testing the waters\n   - Their quick return to hare indicates they still prefer safety after risk backfires\n\n3. Consider what the Round 13 deviation tells us:\n   - The opponent is still capable of strategic thinking and experimentation\n   - They're not completely locked into automatic hare choices\n   - However, they quickly reverted when stag didn't pay off\n   - This reinforces that they learned the lesson about risk vs. safety\n\n4. Evaluate the opponent's likely reasoning for Round 15:\n   - They just confirmed again that deviating from hare leads to poor outcomes (1 point)\n   - They got back to a safe 2 points by returning to hare\n   - They might stick with hare now, having re-learned the lesson\n   - Or they might try stag again if they think I'm predictably stuck on hare\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - The opponent has now been \"burned\" twice by choosing stag (Rounds 2 and 13)\n   - Both times they got only 1 point while I got 6\n   - This reinforces the pattern that hare is safer for them\n   - They're likely to be more cautious after this recent reminder\n\n6. Mathematical considerations:\n   - Regardless of their choice, hare remains my dominant strategy\n   - If they choose hare: I get 2 points (vs 1 with stag)\n   - If they choose stag: I get 6 points (vs 4 with stag)\n   - The recent events don't change the fundamental math\n\n7. Strategic conclusion:\n   - The opponent's brief experiment confirms they still face the same incentives\n   - Their quick return to hare suggests they prefer safety\n   - Hare continues to be optimal regardless of their choice\n   - My strategy should remain consistent with the mathematical reality\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the dominant strategy that has consistently delivered optimal results.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's post-deviation behavior:\n   - After their Round 13 experiment with stag (which gave them 1 point), they've returned to hare for 2 consecutive rounds\n   - This suggests they've re-learned the lesson about the risks of deviating\n   - Their pattern shows: long hare streak \u2192 stag experiment \u2192 quick return to hare\n   - They appear to be settling back into the safe, predictable pattern\n\n3. Consider the psychological impact on the opponent:\n   - They've now been \"burned\" by stag twice (Rounds 2 and 13)\n   - Both experiments resulted in their worst possible outcome (1 point)\n   - Meanwhile, they see me consistently getting good results with hare\n   - This reinforces their belief that hare is the safer choice\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - The opponent seems to have satisfied their curiosity about breaking the pattern\n   - They quickly reverted to hare after the negative outcome\n   - The stable hare-hare equilibrium appears to be re-establishing itself\n   - Their risk tolerance seems to have decreased after the recent reminder\n\n5. Consider the opponent's likely reasoning for Round 16:\n   - They've had 2 rounds to \"cool off\" from their failed experiment\n   - They're getting consistent 2-point outcomes again with hare\n   - They might be less likely to experiment again so soon after being burned\n   - The pattern suggests a return to their previous long-term hare preference\n\n6. Mathematical assessment:\n   - Hare remains the dominant strategy regardless of their choice\n   - The recent events don't change the fundamental payoff structure\n   - If they choose hare: I get 2 points (optimal vs. 1 with stag)\n   - If they choose stag: I get 6 points (better than 4 with stag)\n\n7. Strategic conclusion:\n   - The opponent appears to be stabilizing back into hare choices\n   - Their brief experiment reinforced why hare is safer for them\n   - My consistent hare strategy continues to be mathematically optimal\n   - No compelling reason exists to deviate from the proven approach\n\nFinal decision: Maintain the dominant strategy that has consistently delivered optimal outcomes.\n\n[move] hare\n"
