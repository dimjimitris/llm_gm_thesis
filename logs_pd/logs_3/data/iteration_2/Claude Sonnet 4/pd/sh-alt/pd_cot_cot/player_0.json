Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The key insight is that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the best mutual outcome, but there's risk involved.\n\n3. **Consider opponent behavior:**\n   The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely haven't developed a strategy yet and might make decisions based on immediate risk assessment.\n\n4. **Evaluate my options:**\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 6 points (if they cooperate with stag) or 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n\n5. **Strategic reasoning:**\n   Since this is against a fresh player, they might be cautious and choose the \"safer\" hare option to avoid the worst outcome (1 point). However, hare also offers the chance for the highest individual payoff (6 points) if the opponent chooses stag.\n\n6. **Decision:**\n   I'll choose hare because: (a) it guarantees I won't get the worst outcome of 1 point, (b) it gives me a chance at the highest individual payoff of 6 points, and (c) against a fresh/inexperienced player, there's a reasonable chance they might choose the cooperative stag option.\n\n[move] hare\n"

The opponent has shown extraordinary commitment to cooperation, declining six straight opportunities for higher individual gains. This level of trust and stability is precious and should be maintained.\n\n[move] stag\n"
