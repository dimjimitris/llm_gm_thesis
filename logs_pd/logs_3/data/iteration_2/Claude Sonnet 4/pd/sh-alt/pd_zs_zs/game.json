The key considerations are:\n1. Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the best joint outcome (4 each)\n2. But stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n3. Hare is the safer choice, guaranteeing at least 2 points\n4. If I think the opponent will choose hare, I should also choose hare to get 2 instead of 1\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\" who hasn't established any patterns or trust, they might be cautious and choose the safer hare option. However, they might also reason that mutual stag cooperation is better and choose stag.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and that this appears to be an initial round, I'll choose the cooperative move that could lead to the best mutual outcome.\n\n[move] I choose stag, hoping for mutual cooperation for the optimal 4-4 outcome.\n"
