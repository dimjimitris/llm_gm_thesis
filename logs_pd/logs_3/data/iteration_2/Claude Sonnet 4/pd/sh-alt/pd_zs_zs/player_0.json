You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The key considerations are:\n1. Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the best joint outcome (4 each)\n2. But stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n3. Hare is the safer choice, guaranteeing at least 2 points\n4. If I think the opponent will choose hare, I should also choose hare to get 2 instead of 1\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\" who hasn't established any patterns or trust, they might be cautious and choose the safer hare option. However, they might also reason that mutual stag cooperation is better and choose stag.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and that this appears to be an initial round, I'll choose the cooperative move that could lead to the best mutual outcome.\n\n[move] I choose stag, hoping for mutual cooperation for the optimal 4-4 outcome.\n"
