    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the key strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where cooperation (both choosing stag) gives a good mutual outcome\n   - However, there's a risk/reward tradeoff: choosing hare is safer but potentially less rewarding\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses stag, I get the best outcome (6 points)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might be cautious and choose the safer option (hare)\n   - Or they might not fully understand the strategy and choose randomly\n   - They likely haven't developed trust or cooperation patterns yet\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Choosing stag: High reward if opponent cooperates (4 points), but high risk if they don't (1 point)\n   - Choosing hare: Guaranteed at least 2 points, with potential for 6 points if opponent chooses stag\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player with unknown tendencies, and the penalty for misplaced trust is severe (1 point vs 6 points for opponent), the safer strategy is to choose hare.\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to minimize risk while maintaining upside potential.\n\n[move] hare"

Review the previous round outcome:\n   - Both players chose hare\n   - We both got 2 points each\n   - This tells me the opponent also played cautiously/safely\n\n2. Analyze what this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They chose the same safe strategy I did\n   - This suggests they might be risk-averse or thinking similarly to me\n   - They might be testing the waters in the first round\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications for this round:\n   - If my opponent continues to think I'll play hare, they might switch to stag to try for the 4-point mutual cooperation\n   - Or they might stick with hare since it worked safely before\n   - There's also a chance they'll try to exploit me by continuing with hare while expecting me to switch to stag\n\n4. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 4 points (better than last round)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (bad outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: We both get 2 points (same as last round)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Since we both played conservatively last round, there might be an opportunity to signal cooperation\n   - However, the risk is still high if I'm wrong\n   - Given that this opponent showed cautious behavior, they might stick with hare again\n   - Choosing hare gives me either 2 or 6 points, while stag gives me either 1 or 4 points\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the safer strategy since my opponent showed similar risk-averse behavior.\n\n[move] hare"
