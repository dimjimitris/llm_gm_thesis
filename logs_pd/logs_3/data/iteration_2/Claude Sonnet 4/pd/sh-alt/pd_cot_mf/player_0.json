Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperative benefit of both choosing stag\n   - They might be attracted to the high reward (6 points) from choosing hare when I choose stag\n   - They might play conservatively and choose hare for the guaranteed minimum of 2 points\n\n3. Risk analysis:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 4 points (if they cooperate), worst case 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 6 points (if they choose stag), worst case 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n\n4. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" who may not understand the cooperative strategy, and the hint suggests this is our first interaction, I should assume they might choose the safer hare option or try to exploit me.\n\n5. Given the uncertainty about their strategy and the significant penalty for being exploited (only 1 point if I choose stag and they choose hare), the safer play is hare, which guarantees at least 2 points and gives me a chance at 6 points.\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to minimize risk while maintaining upside potential.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I got 6 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This means my opponent tried to cooperate but I defected\n\n2. Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose the cooperative move (stag) in the first round\n   - They likely expected mutual cooperation for 4 points each\n   - They got punished with only 1 point while I got 6\n\n3. Predict their likely response this round:\n   - They may feel betrayed and switch to hare to avoid being exploited again\n   - They might try stag one more time if they believe in cooperation\n   - Most rational players would switch to hare after being exploited\n\n4. Analyze my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare (likely): I get 1, they get 6\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare (likely): We both get 2\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag (less likely): We both get 4\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag (unlikely): I get 6, they get 1\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - The opponent is now likely to choose hare after being exploited\n   - Choosing stag would be very risky (likely only 1 point)\n   - Choosing hare gives me either 2 points (if they also choose hare) or 6 points (if they surprisingly choose stag again)\n\nFinal decision: Given that the opponent was just exploited, they will most likely choose hare this round to protect themselves.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Consider the current game state:\n   - We're perfectly tied at 11 points each\n   - Both players have settled into a mutual hare pattern (rounds 2 and 4)\n   - The opponent seems locked into defensive play\n\n4.

Analyze the opponent's extremely consistent pattern:\n   - After the initial round, they've chosen hare for FOUR consecutive rounds (2, 3, 4, 5)\n   - This is now a deeply established pattern of defensive play\n   - They've shown zero deviation from this strategy despite multiple opportunities\n\n3. Consider the psychological dynamics:\n   - We've been locked in mutual hare (2-2) for the last three rounds\n   - Both players are getting relatively low rewards (2 points each)\n   - The opponent might be getting frustrated with the low payoffs\n   - However, they seem extremely risk-averse after the initial exploitation\n\n4. Evaluate potential for change:\n   - The opponent has had multiple chances to try stag but hasn't\n   - Four consecutive hare choices indicates a very strong commitment to safety\n   - The tie score means neither player has pressure to dramatically change strategy\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) would give us both 4 points, much better than 2\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If I try stag to break the deadlock and encourage cooperation:\n     * Risk: They likely continue hare \u2192 I get 1, they get 6, I fall behind\n     * Reward: If they also try stag \u2192 We both get 4, much better outcome\n   - If I continue hare:\n     * Almost certain: We both get 2 again, maintaining the tie\n     * Safe but low-reward strategy\n\n6. Decision factors:\n   - The opponent's pattern is extremely strong (4 consecutive hares)\n   - Breaking this pattern is very risky given their consistency\n   - However, we're both stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium\n   - Someone needs to take a risk to potentially achieve better mutual outcomes\n\nGiven the opponent's incredibly consistent defensive pattern, the risk of choosing stag is very high.

Analyze the opponent's pattern:\n   - FIVE consecutive hare choices (rounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n   - This is an extremely entrenched defensive strategy\n   - They've had multiple opportunities to deviate but haven't\n   - The pattern is becoming almost mechanical at this point\n\n3. Consider the current situation:\n   - We've been locked in mutual hare for FOUR straight rounds\n   - Both getting only 2 points per round - very suboptimal\n   - We're perfectly tied and getting predictable, low rewards\n   - This stalemate could continue indefinitely\n\n4. Evaluate the psychology:\n   - The opponent seems to have completely written off cooperation\n   - They might prefer the safety of 2 points over any risk\n   - After 5 consecutive hares, this is now their default strategy\n   - They may not even be considering other options anymore\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If this continues, we'll just keep getting 2 points each forever\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) would give us 4 points each - double the current outcome\n   - But attempting stag carries high risk given their unwavering pattern\n   - The opportunity cost of staying in this 2-2 pattern is significant\n\n6. Risk assessment and breakthrough thinking:\n   - Their pattern is SO consistent that they might not expect me to deviate\n   - Sometimes in game theory, you need to take calculated risks to break bad equilibria\n   - We're both losing out on better potential outcomes\n   - If I keep playing hare, we'll be stuck in this 2-2 pattern indefinitely\n\n7. Final strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown 5 consecutive hares - this is extremely predictable\n   - While risky, someone needs to attempt breaking this suboptimal pattern\n   - If they continue their pattern (very likely), I lose this round but might signal willingness to cooperate\n   - If they're also getting tired of 2-2 and try stag, we both win big with 4 points each\n\nThis is a critical decision point. The safe play maintains the tie but keeps us both in a suboptimal outcome. Taking a cooperative risk might break the deadlock.\n\nFinal decision: Take the cooperative risk to potentially break the stalemate.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Evaluate my options realistically:\n   - If I choose stag: Almost certain 1 point for me, 6 for them (gap becomes 8 points)\n   - If I choose hare: Certain 2 points each (gap stays at 5 points)\n   - There is absolutely zero evidence the opponent will ever choose stag\n\n5. Strategic acceptance:\n   - The opponent has found an optimal strategy against me - consistent hare\n   - They exploited my cooperative attempts and now maintain a lead\n   - The only way to prevent the gap from growing is to keep choosing hare\n   - This creates a stable but suboptimal Nash equilibrium where we both get 2 points\n\n6. Long-term considerations:\n   - Unless something drastically changes, this game will continue with mutual hare\n   - The opponent will maintain their 5-point advantage indefinitely\n   - Any attempt to break this pattern has proven costly (I've tried twice and failed both times)\n   - The rational choice is to accept this equilibrium and prevent further losses\n\nFinal decision: The opponent's strategy is completely predictable and unchangeable. I must continue with hare to maintain stability and prevent falling further behind.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's ironclad pattern:\n   - EIGHT consecutive hare choices (rounds 2-9)\n   - This is now beyond predictable - it's a mathematical certainty\n   - They maintain their 5-point lead consistently\n   - They have never deviated once since being exploited in round 1\n\n3. Strategic reality:\n   - The opponent has found the perfect counter-strategy to any cooperation attempt\n   - They're ahead and locked into a strategy that prevents me from catching up through exploitation\n   - We're in a stable pattern where both get 2 points, maintaining the gap\n   - This is essentially a solved game at this point\n\n4. Consider if anything has changed:\n   - Nothing in the opponent's behavior suggests any willingness to cooperate\n   - The gap remains constant at 5 points\n   - My two attempts at cooperation (rounds 3 and 7) both failed identically\n   - The pattern is so strong it's become automatic\n\n5. Evaluate my realistic options:\n   - Stag: 1 point for me, 6 for opponent (gap grows to 8 points) - clearly bad\n   - Hare: 2 points each (gap stays at 5 points) - maintains status quo\n   - The opponent will choose hare with 100% certainty based on 8 consecutive rounds\n\n6. Strategic conclusion:\n   - This has become a completely deterministic game\n   - The opponent will always choose hare\n   - I must choose hare to prevent the gap from widening\n   - Any other choice is mathematically inferior\n\nFinal decision: The pattern is absolute.
