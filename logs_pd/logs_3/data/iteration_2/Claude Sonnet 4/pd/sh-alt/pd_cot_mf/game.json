Consider my opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They got burned badly in Round 1 (1 point)\n   - They played defensively in Round 2 (hare) and got a safer 2 points\n   - They might now think I'm always going to choose hare\n   - They could be considering switching to stag to try for the 4-4 cooperative outcome\n\n3.

Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent might be testing whether I'll reciprocate cooperation\n   - But they also might stay defensive after being exploited\n   - Hare continues to offer the best risk/reward profile\n   - I'm ahead in points, so maintaining advantage is key\n\nFinal decision: Stick with hare as it maintains my strategic advantage and protects against risk while keeping upside potential.\n\n[move] (Opponent might be considering cooperation but could still be defensive - hare maintains my advantage with good upside protection) hare\n"

Evaluate strategic options:\n   - Continue with hare: Guaranteed 2 points, maintains safe pattern\n   - Switch to stag: Risk 1 point if opponent stays defensive, but could signal willingness to cooperate for future 4-4 outcomes\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent seems locked into defensive play\n   - I have a comfortable point lead (10 vs opponent's likely 5)\n   - Sometimes showing willingness to cooperate can break deadlocks\n   - If opponent chooses hare again, I only lose 1 net point but might encourage future cooperation\n   - If opponent is testing me and switches to stag, we both get 4 points\n\nFinal decision: Switch to stag to potentially break the defensive pattern and signal cooperation, especially since I have a point advantage.\n\n[move] (Time to test if opponent is ready for mutual cooperation - my point lead gives me room to take this calculated risk) stag\n"
