Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Decision rationale:\n   - Since the opponent showed caution in Round 1, they might continue being cautious\n   - But there's also a possibility they learned from Round 1 and might try stag\n   - Hare still provides the best guaranteed minimum (2 points) and best maximum (6 points)\n\n[move] (The opponent showed caution last round, so hare remains the safer choice with good upside potential) hare\n"

Predicting opponent's likely thinking for Round 3:\n   - They just got the worst outcome (1 point) while I got the best (6 points)\n   - They might feel exploited and want to avoid that again\n   - They could either: go back to safe hare, or double down on stag expecting me to cooperate now\n\n4.

Analyzing the remarkable consistency:\n   - We've now had 8 consecutive rounds of mutual hare choices\n   - The opponent has chosen hare in 9 out of 10 total rounds\n   - This represents an incredibly stable and predictable pattern\n   - The opponent seems to have completely committed to hare as their strategy\n\n3. Considering Round 10 as potentially significant:\n   - Round 10 might feel like a milestone that could prompt a strategy change\n   - However, the opponent's pattern is so entrenched that change seems unlikely\n   - Their single attempt at stag (Round 2) was punished severely, reinforcing hare choice\n   - Eight consecutive successful hare rounds have likely cemented this approach\n\n4. Evaluating my strategic position:\n   - My average is 2.44 points per round (22 points over 9 rounds)\n   - My hare strategy has been dominant throughout\n   - The mathematical reality strongly favors continuing with hare\n\n5. Final strategic assessment:\n   - Against an opponent this committed to hare, stag would give me only 1 point\n   - The opponent shows no signs of strategic deviation\n   - Hare remains the mathematically optimal choice regardless of their decision\n\n[move] (After 8 consecutive mutual hare rounds and 9 hare choices out of 10 total, opponent's commitment to hare is absolute, making hare the clear choice) hare\n"
