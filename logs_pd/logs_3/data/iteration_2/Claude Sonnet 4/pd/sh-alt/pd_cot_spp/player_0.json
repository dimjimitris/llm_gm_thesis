Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not understand the strategic implications\n   - They might choose randomly or go for the safer option\n   - They might be tempted by the high reward (6 points) from choosing hare when I choose stag\n\n3. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I either get 4 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I either get 6 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag is risky because if the opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6 points\n   - Against a fresh player who might not coordinate or might be tempted by the 6-point reward, hare seems safer\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player who may not understand the coordination aspect of the game, and hare gives me either a good outcome (6 points) or an acceptable outcome (2 points), while stag could leave me with only 1 point, I should choose hare.\n\n[move] hare"

From the previous round, I learned that:\n   - The other player also chose hare\n   - This suggests they might be thinking similarly to me - going for the safer/more aggressive option\n   - We both got 2 points instead of the potential 4 points from mutual cooperation\n\n2. Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - They saw that we both chose hare and got 2 points each\n   - They might realize that if we both chose stag, we would have gotten 4 points each\n   - They might try to coordinate on stag this time\n   - Or they might stick with hare since it worked reasonably well\n\n3. Analyzing my strategic options:\n   - If I think they'll switch to stag (trying to coordinate for 4 points), then I should choose stag too for 4 points\n   - If I think they'll stick with hare, then hare gives me 2 points vs stag giving me only 1 point\n   - If I choose hare and they switch to stag, I get 6 points (best outcome for me)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since they chose hare in round 1, they showed they're willing to take the safer/more aggressive approach\n   - A fresh player who chose hare once might not immediately switch to the coordination strategy\n   - Even if they do switch to stag, my hare choice gives me the maximum 6 points\n   - If they stick with hare, I get 2 points (same as before)\n\n5. The risk-reward analysis favors hare again:\n   - Hare vs their stag: I get 6 points (excellent)\n   - Hare vs their hare: I get 2 points (acceptable)\n   - This seems better than the stag option against an unpredictable fresh player\n\n[move] hare"
