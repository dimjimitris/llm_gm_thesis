Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the key strategic considerations:\n   - If I choose stag, I either get 4 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 1 point (if opponent chooses hare)\n   - If I choose hare, I either get 2 points (if opponent chooses hare) or 6 points (if opponent chooses stag)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player hasn't established patterns yet\n   - They might go for the cooperative option (stag) for mutual benefit\n   - Or they might try to exploit with hare for the potential 6-point reward\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing stag: Guaranteed at least 1 point, potential for 4 points with cooperation\n   - Choosing hare: Guaranteed at least 2 points, potential for 6 points if opponent cooperates\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Hare dominates stag as a strategy because the worst outcome with hare (2 points) is better than the worst outcome with stag (1 point)\n   - Additionally, hare offers the highest possible individual payoff (6 points)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I should choose hare to maximize my expected payoff.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the extraordinary stability:\n   - We now have 7 consecutive rounds of both choosing hare\n   - Only 1 deviation in 9 total rounds (opponent's stag in round 2, now 7 rounds ago)\n   - This pattern has become essentially unbreakable\n   - The opponent has completely committed to the hare strategy\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - At this point, the game has reached perfect predictability\n   - Both players have optimized to the Nash equilibrium\n   - The opponent's single experiment with stag (round 2) taught them to stick with hare\n   - My consistency has been rewarded with steady, reliable points\n\n4. Evaluate any possible reason to deviate:\n   - Mathematical dominance of hare remains unchanged\n   - Historical evidence shows opponent will choose hare with near-certainty\n   - Risk of choosing stag: almost certain to get only 1 point\n   - Benefit of choosing hare: almost certain to get 2 points\n   - Expected value strongly favors continuing with hare\n\n5. Consider game theory principles:\n   - This is a perfect example of how repeated games converge to stable strategies\n   - Both players have learned and adapted optimally\n   - The equilibrium is mutually beneficial compared to constant conflict\n   - Breaking the pattern would violate rational play\n\n6. Final strategic reasoning:\n   - The pattern is extremely well-established and profitable\n   - Both players have demonstrated commitment to this equilibrium\n   - Consistency continues to be the optimal approach\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the proven, highly stable strategy.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both chose hare \u2192 I got 2 points\n   - Round 2: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 6 points\n   - Rounds 3-10: Both chose hare \u2192 I got 2 points each round\n   - Total so far: 24 points over 10 rounds\n\n2. Analyze the pattern strength:\n   - We now have 8 consecutive rounds of both choosing hare\n   - Only 1 deviation in 10 total rounds (opponent's stag in round 2, now 8 rounds ago)\n   - This represents an incredibly stable behavioral equilibrium\n   - The opponent has shown zero inclination to deviate for 8 straight rounds\n\n3. Consider the strategic landscape:\n   - This game has essentially become deterministic\n   - Both players have converged on the optimal repeated game strategy\n   - The opponent learned from their early mistake and committed to safety\n   - My consistent approach has yielded steady, predictable returns\n\n4. Evaluate potential for change:\n   - The opponent has had 8 consecutive opportunities to try stag and hasn't\n   - They've demonstrated complete risk aversion after their round 2 experience\n   - Expected probability of opponent choosing hare: 99%+\n   - Expected probability of opponent choosing stag: <1%\n\n5. Calculate expected values:\n   - If I choose hare: 99%+ chance of 2 points, <1% chance of 2 points = ~2 points\n   - If I choose stag: 99%+ chance of 1 point, <1% chance of 4 points = ~1.03 points\n   - Hare clearly dominates in expected value\n\n6. Strategic conclusion:\n   - We've reached a perfect Nash equilibrium in repeated play\n   - Both players are maximizing their outcomes given the other's strategy\n   - The pattern is self-reinforcing and extremely stable\n   - Any deviation would be irrational\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Maintain the exceptionally successful pattern.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the unprecedented stability:\n   - We now have 9 consecutive rounds of both choosing hare\n   - Only 1 deviation in 11 total rounds (opponent's stag in round 2, now 9 rounds ago)\n   - This represents one of the most stable equilibriums possible in game theory\n   - The opponent has shown absolutely no deviation tendency for 9 straight rounds\n\n3. Consider the psychological aspect:\n   - At this point, both players are completely locked into this pattern\n   - The opponent has had 9 consecutive opportunities to experiment and hasn't\n   - They've demonstrated total commitment to the safe, predictable strategy\n   - My consistency has created a reliable, mutually beneficial outcome\n\n4.
