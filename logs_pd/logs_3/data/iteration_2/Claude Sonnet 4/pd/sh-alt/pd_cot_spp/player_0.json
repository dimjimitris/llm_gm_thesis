Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperative nature of the game\n   - They might be tempted by the high reward (6 points) from choosing hare when I choose stag\n   - They might play conservatively and choose hare to avoid the worst outcome (1 point)\n\n3. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 6 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag is risky against an unknown player - if they choose hare, I only get 1 point\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and could give me 6 points\n   - Against a \"fresh player\" who might not cooperate or might be risk-averse, hare seems safer\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player who may not understand the cooperative strategy or might be tempted by the 6-point reward, I should protect myself from the worst outcome while maintaining upside potential.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare to minimize risk while maintaining upside potential against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] hare"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - Both players chose hare\n   - We both got 2 points\n   - This suggests the other player also played conservatively or had similar reasoning\n\n2. Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose hare, which could mean:\n     * They're risk-averse like I was\n     * They're also trying to avoid the worst outcome (1 point)\n     * They might be thinking similarly to me about playing against an unknown opponent\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - If they're consistently risk-averse, they might choose hare again\n   - But now they know I chose hare last round, so they might try to exploit this by choosing stag\n   - If they choose stag and I choose hare again, I get 6 points\n   - If we both choose stag, we both get the optimal cooperative outcome of 4 points each\n\n4. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If I choose hare again: I get 2 points if they choose hare, or 6 points if they choose stag\n   - If I choose stag: I get 4 points if they choose stag, or 1 point if they choose hare\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The fact that they chose hare in round 1 suggests they might be thinking cooperatively\n   - If they're learning from the game, they might realize that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the best joint outcome\n   - Since we both played conservatively last round, they might be willing to take the cooperative risk this time\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - If they stick with hare, choosing stag gives me only 1 point vs 2 points for choosing hare\n   - But if they switch to stag (trying for cooperation), choosing stag gives me 4 points vs 6 points for choosing hare\n   - The key question is whether they'll try to cooperate or stay conservative\n\nSince they showed conservative play last round, I think there's a reasonable chance they might try the cooperative move (stag) this round. I'll take the cooperative approach.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to attempt cooperation and achieve the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] stag"

Analyze what this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They started conservatively with hare (like me)\n   - They switched to stag in round 2, showing they're willing to cooperate\n   - They're demonstrating strategic thinking and adaptability\n   - This suggests they understand the cooperative nature of the game\n\n3. Consider the current strategic situation:\n   - We've established a pattern of mutual cooperation in round 2\n   - The opponent has shown they can think beyond just conservative play\n   - They're likely analyzing my moves just as I'm analyzing theirs\n\n4. Evaluate what they might be thinking:\n   - They know I switched from hare to stag, showing I'm willing to cooperate\n   - They might expect me to continue with stag since it worked well\n   - They might also be tempted to exploit this by choosing hare (getting 6 points while I get 1)\n   - Or they might value the stable cooperation and choose stag again\n\n5. Assess my strategic options:\n   - If I choose stag: 4 points if they choose stag, 1 point if they choose hare\n   - If I choose hare: 6 points if they choose stag, 2 points if they choose hare\n\n6. Risk vs reward analysis:\n   - The successful cooperation in round 2 suggests we might have found a stable strategy\n   - However, the temptation to defect (choose hare when opponent chooses stag) is always present\n   - Given that they've proven to be a strategic thinker, there's some risk they might try to exploit me\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - We've established trust through successful cooperation\n   - Breaking that trust would be risky for both of us long-term\n   - The 4-4 outcome is the second-best individual outcome and the best joint outcome\n   - Maintaining cooperation seems like the rational choice\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag again to maintain the cooperative relationship we've established.\n\n[move] stag"

Analyze the pattern that has emerged:\n   - We've now had two consecutive rounds of successful cooperation\n   - Both players seem to have settled into the mutually beneficial stag strategy\n   - The opponent has shown consistent cooperative behavior after the initial conservative round\n\n3. Consider the psychological dynamics:\n   - We've built a stable cooperative relationship\n   - Both players are getting good returns (4 points per round)\n   - There's an established pattern of trust\n\n4. Evaluate the temptation to defect:\n   - The potential reward for choosing hare while opponent chooses stag is 6 points\n   - But this would break the established trust and likely lead to retaliation\n   - The risk is getting only 1 point if they also switch to hare in response\n\n5. Consider what my opponent might be thinking:\n   - They've seen consistent cooperation from me in the last two rounds\n   - They might be tempted to exploit this predictability\n   - Or they might value the stable 4-point return and stick with cooperation\n   - Given their strategic thinking shown earlier, they likely understand the value of sustained cooperation\n\n6.
