We both got 2 points.\n\nTheir sequence continues flawlessly:\n- Round 3: hare\n- Round 4: stag  \n- Round 5: hare\n- Round 6: stag\n- Round 7: hare\n- Round 8: stag\n- Round 9: hare\n- Round 10: stag\n- Round 11: hare\n- Round 12: stag\n- Round 13: hare\n- Round 14: stag\n- Round 15: hare\n\nFollowing this perfect alternating pattern, their next move should be stag.\n\nAt this point, I'm confident they're locked into this alternating strategy. They've done it for 13 consecutive rounds without deviation. When they play stag next, I have the choice to either:\n- Play stag for mutual 4 points (cooperation)\n- Play hare for 6 points while they get 1 (exploitation)\n\nGiven how predictable they've become, and since I've been exploited by this pattern multiple times earlier, I think it's fair to take advantage of their rigidity again.\n\n[move] (They should play stag next according to their unwavering alternating pattern, giving me another opportunity to exploit) hare",
