My read was correct - we both chose stag and got 4 points each, which is a solid cooperative outcome.\n\nNow let me analyze the pattern:\n- Round 1: Both hare (2 each)\n- Round 2: Me hare, them stag (6 for me, 1 for them)\n- Round 3: Both hare (2 each)  \n- Round 4: Both stag (4 each)\n\nThis suggests my opponent may be developing a more sophisticated strategy. After the mutual cooperation success in round 4, they have a few possible thought processes:\n\n1. They might stick with stag, expecting me to also stick with stag for continued mutual benefit\n2. They might switch to hare, thinking I'll stick with stag, allowing them to exploit me for 6 points\n3. They might think I'll switch to hare (to exploit them), so they'll also switch to hare defensively\n\nThe key insight is that we just achieved a good mutual outcome (4 points each). In game theory, successful cooperation often breeds more cooperation, especially when both players benefit equally.\n\nHowever, there's also the temptation to exploit: if they think I'll stick with stag (since cooperation just worked), they could switch to hare for maximum gain.\n\nGiven that we just established successful cooperation and both got decent points, I think there's a good chance they'll try to maintain this cooperative dynamic.\n\n[move] (We just successfully cooperated for mutual benefit, so they'll likely continue with stag to maintain this positive dynamic) stag\n"

My opponent seems to have a pattern of exploiting successful cooperation. After we both cooperated with stag in round 4, they immediately switched to hare to exploit my expected continued cooperation.\n\nThis suggests they're quite strategic - they're willing to cooperate when it benefits them, but they're also quick to exploit when they sense an opportunity.\n\nNow for round 6, I need to consider:\n- They just got maximum points (6) by exploiting me\n- They might expect me to retreat to hare (like they did in round 3 after being exploited in round 2)\n- Or they might think I'll try to get revenge by choosing hare while expecting them to choose stag\n- They could also think I'll stick with stag, hoping to rebuild cooperation\n\nGiven that they just successfully exploited me, they might expect me to play defensively with hare. If so, they might choose stag hoping to exploit again (getting 6 while I get 1) or hare to play it safe.\n\nBut I think they're more likely to expect defensive play from me after getting burned.\n\n[move] (They just exploited me successfully and will likely expect me to retreat defensively, so I'll try to capitalize on their likely stag choice) hare\n"

My opponent just got burned with 1 point in round 6, just like they did in round 2.\n\nLooking at what happened after round 2 (when they got 1 point): they switched to hare in round 3 for safety.\n\nSo for round 7, I expect them to likely switch to hare again after getting exploited.

The pattern holds - after getting exploited in round 6, my opponent retreated to hare in round 7, just like they did after round 2.\n\nCurrent pattern:\n- Round 1: Both hare (2 each)\n- Round 2: Me hare, them stag (6 for me, 1 for them)\n- Round 3: Both hare (2 each) [they retreated after being exploited]\n- Round 4: Both stag (4 each) [mutual cooperation attempt]\n- Round 5: Me stag, them hare (1 for me, 6 for them) [they exploited cooperation]\n- Round 6: Me hare, them stag (6 for me, 1 for them) [I exploited their attempt]\n- Round 7: Both hare (2 each) [they retreated after being exploited]\n\nI'm seeing a clear behavioral pattern in my opponent:\n1. After being exploited (getting 1 point), they retreat to hare for safety\n2. After a safe round or two, they attempt cooperation or exploitation\n3. They're willing to break cooperation for personal gain\n\nNow in round 8, they've had their \"safe\" retreat round. Based on the pattern, they might:\n- Try cooperation again (stag) like they did in round 4 after the round 3 retreat\n- Stay safe with hare for another round\n- Attempt to exploit if they think I'll switch to stag\n\nLooking at rounds 3\u21924, after their safe retreat they tried cooperation with stag. They might repeat this pattern and try stag again.\n\n[move] (Following their pattern, they might try cooperation again like in round 4 after their retreat) hare\n"

This was their \"retreat\" round after I exploited them in round 6.\n\nFollowing their established pattern, after a retreat round they often attempt cooperation (like they did in round 4 after the round 3 retreat). They might try stag again, hoping for mutual cooperation or expecting me to choose stag so they can exploit.\n\nIf they choose stag and I choose hare, I get 6 points. If we both choose stag, we get 4 each. If they choose hare and I choose hare, we get 2 each.\n\nGiven their pattern of attempting cooperation or exploitation after retreat rounds, there's a good chance they'll try stag.\n\n[move] (They typically attempt cooperation or exploitation after retreat rounds, so if they choose stag I can capitalize) hare\n"
