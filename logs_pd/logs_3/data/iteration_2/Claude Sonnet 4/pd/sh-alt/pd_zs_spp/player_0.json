My opponent has now chosen:\n- Hare in 11 out of 14 rounds (78.6%)\n- Stag only 3 times (rounds 4, 6, and 11)\n- Hare for 3 consecutive rounds since their last stag choice\n\nAt this point, the behavioral data is overwhelming. My opponent has established a very clear preference for hare, with only rare deviations to stag. Their strategy appears to be primarily defensive, prioritizing the guaranteed 2 points over the risk of cooperation.\n\nThe mathematical expectation strongly favors continuing with hare:\n- Expected outcome: 2 points when we both choose hare (very high probability)\n- Bonus possibility: 6 points if they unexpectedly choose stag (low probability but excellent payoff)\n- Risk avoided: 1 point if I chose stag while they stick to their hare pattern (poor outcome)\n\nWith 14 rounds of data showing such a strong preference for hare, there's no strategic reason to change my approach.\n\n[move] (My opponent has now chosen hare 11 out of 14 times, making it the overwhelmingly likely choice again) hare\n"

My opponent has settled into what appears to be a predominantly hare-based strategy with only very occasional deviations. The 80% rate of choosing hare makes this one of the most consistent behavioral patterns I could observe in a strategic game.\n\nGiven this established pattern:\n- Probability of them choosing hare again is very high based on 15 rounds of data\n- Choosing hare guarantees me at least 2 points and potentially 6 if they surprise with stag\n- The risk-reward calculation heavily favors continuing with hare\n\nThere's simply no compelling strategic reason to deviate from a strategy that consistently yields results against such a predictable opponent.\n\n[move] (With 12 hare choices out of 15 rounds and 4 consecutive hares, my opponent's pattern is extremely predictable) hare\n"
