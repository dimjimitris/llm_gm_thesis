The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with the following payoff matrix:\n\nMy move vs Opponent's move:\n- Stag vs Stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n- Stag vs Hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6  \n- Hare vs Stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n- Hare vs Hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n\nKey observations:\n1. If we both cooperate (choose Stag), we both get the best mutual outcome (4 points each)\n2. If I choose Hare while opponent chooses Stag, I get the maximum individual payoff (6 points)\n3. However, if opponent chooses Hare while I choose Stag, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\" who hasn't established any pattern yet, I need to consider:\n- They might not understand the cooperative benefit of both choosing Stag\n- They might play it safe with Hare to avoid the worst outcome\n- They might be greedy and go for the 6-point payoff with Hare\n\nGiven the uncertainty about their strategy and the risk of getting only 1 point if I choose Stag and they choose Hare, the safer strategic move is Hare, which guarantees me at least 2 points and potentially 6 points.\n\n[move] Hare\n"

Now I have some information about this opponent - they also chose the \"safer\" option that avoids the worst-case scenario.\n\nLet me reconsider the situation:\n- The opponent chose Hare like me, showing they might be risk-averse or strategic\n- We both got 2 points, which is the mutual \"safe\" outcome\n- If we could both trust each other to choose Stag, we'd both get 4 points instead of 2\n\nThis creates an interesting dilemma. The opponent might:\n1. Stick with Hare again, thinking it's the safe play\n2. Switch to Stag, hoping I'll do the same for mutual benefit\n3. Switch to Stag, trying to exploit me if I stick with Hare\n\nSince they chose Hare in the first round (showing some caution), there's a chance they might be thinking about the mutual benefit of both choosing Stag now. However, there's still significant risk - if I choose Stag and they stick with Hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the high penalty for being wrong, I'll stick with the safer strategy.\n\n[move] Hare\n"

This round revealed important information about my opponent's strategy and thinking.\n\nAnalysis of what happened:\n- I chose Hare, opponent chose Stag\n- I got 6 points (the maximum possible), opponent got 1 point (the minimum)\n- My opponent switched from Hare to Stag, likely trying to establish cooperation or trust\n\nThis tells me several things about my opponent:\n1. They're willing to take risks to achieve mutual cooperation\n2. They might have expected me to also switch to Stag for the mutually beneficial outcome\n3. They're now in a potentially frustrated position, having gotten the worst payoff\n\nNow I need to consider their likely next move:\n- They might stick with Stag again, still hoping for cooperation\n- They might switch back to Hare, feeling burned by the bad outcome\n- They might be angry and choose Hare to ensure I don't get 6 points again\n\nThe opponent showed cooperative intent by choosing Stag, but I exploited it. If they're rational, they might give cooperation one more chance, or they might become defensive. \n\nGiven that I just got the maximum payoff and they got the minimum, there's a reasonable chance they'll either:\n1. Try Stag one more time (hoping for mutual cooperation)\n2. Switch to defensive Hare\n\nIf they choose Stag again, I could either cooperate (Stag for 4 points each) or exploit again (Hare for another 6 points). If they choose Hare, I should also choose Hare to avoid getting only 1 point.\n\nThe safe play is Hare, but there's a tempting opportunity if they're still trying to cooperate.\n\n[move] Hare\n"
