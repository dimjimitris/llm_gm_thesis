Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Fascinating pattern emerges:\n   - Rounds 1-4: Perfect counter-strategy (opposite moves)\n   - Round 5: Both chose hare (matching)\n   - Round 6: Both chose stag (cooperation)  \n   - Rounds 7-8: Back to counter-strategy (opposite moves)\n\n3. The opponent seems to cycle between strategies:\n   - Counter-strategy phase (rounds 1-4)\n   - Matching/cooperation phase (rounds 5-6)\n   - Counter-strategy phase again (rounds 7-8)\n\n4. Current total scores:\n   - My total: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 4 = 23 points\n   - Opponent's total: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 23 points\n   - We're tied again!\n\n5. Strategic prediction:\n   - If the pattern continues, they might be switching back to a matching/cooperation phase\n   - They could choose the same as me (like in rounds 5-6)\n   - Or they might continue the counter-strategy for another round\n\n6. Key insight: The opponent alternates between being predictably opposite and being cooperative/matching. Since we just had 2 rounds of counter-strategy (7-8), they might shift back to matching behavior.\n\n7. Decision factors:\n   - If they match and I choose stag: we both get 6 (best outcome)\n   - If they match and I choose hare: we both get 2\n   - If they counter and I choose stag: I get 1, they get 4\n   - If they counter and I choose hare: I get 4, they get 1\n\nThe opponent appears to cycle between counter-strategy and cooperation phases.

Pattern revision:\n   - The opponent has now done 3 consecutive rounds of counter-strategy (rounds 7-9)\n   - This is longer than their previous counter-strategy phase (rounds 1-4 was 4 rounds)\n   - They may be extending this phase or could switch soon\n\n3.

Strategic assessment:\n   - The counter-strategy is working in their favor when I try to cooperate\n   - I need to either exploit their predictable counter-behavior or wait for them to shift phases\n   - If they continue countering: choosing hare when they choose stag gives me 4 points\n   - If they're about to shift to cooperation: choosing stag when they choose stag gives us both 6 points\n\n5.
