The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic coordination game similar to the Stag Hunt.\n\nLet me examine the payoff matrix:\n- Both choose stag: (6, 6) - mutual cooperation, high reward\n- Both choose hare: (2, 2) - mutual defection, low reward  \n- I choose stag, other chooses hare: (1, 4) - I get punished for cooperating\n- I choose hare, other chooses stag: (4, 1) - I benefit from defecting\n\nThe key considerations:\n1. Stag is the optimal outcome if we can coordinate (6 points each)\n2. Hare is the safer choice - it guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4\n3. Since this is a \"fresh player\" I don't know their tendencies\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player with no established pattern, and considering that choosing hare gives me either 2 or 4 points while choosing stag could give me either 1 or 6 points, the safer strategy would be hare. However, if the other player is also thinking strategically, they might recognize that mutual stag cooperation gives the best joint outcome.\n\nI'll take a calculated risk and go for the cooperative strategy, hoping the other player also sees the mutual benefit.\n\n[move] I choose stag, aiming for the mutually beneficial outcome where we both get 6 points.\n"
