Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n\n```\n           Other: Stag  Other: Hare\nMe: Stag      6,6        1,4\nMe: Hare      4,1        2,2\n```\n\nThe key insights are:\n1. Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint payoff (12 total)\n2. Mutual cooperation gives you the highest individual payoff when the other cooperates (6 points)\n3. But if the other defects to hare while you choose stag, you get the worst outcome (1 point)\n4. Hare is the \"safer\" choice - it guarantees at least 2 points regardless of opponent's move\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed a specific strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n- Choose more conservatively (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n- May not immediately recognize the mutual benefit of coordination\n- Might think more short-term rather than strategically\n\nHowever, the dominant consideration should be: what maximizes my expected payoff?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Let me think through this systematically. If I assume the other player chooses randomly (50/50):\n- Expected payoff from Stag: 0.5 \u00d7 6 + 0.5 \u00d7 1 = 3.5 points\n- Expected payoff from Hare: 0.5 \u00d7 4 + 0.5 \u00d7 2 = 3 points\n\nSo Stag has higher expected value. But there's risk involved.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! But consider this: since both Stag choices lead to the best mutual outcome, and rational players should recognize this, Stag might be the \"focal point\" that rational players coordinate on. However, since they're a fresh player, they might not see this immediately.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** I recommend Stag for these reasons:\n1. Higher expected payoff even with random opponent\n2. Shows cooperative intent which might encourage future cooperation\n3. The upside (6 points) significantly outweighs the downside risk\n4. Fresh players might actually be more likely to choose intuitively \"bigger\" or \"better\" sounding options\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree with Stag. The risk of getting 1 point is worth taking for the chance at 6 points, especially since our expected value calculation favors it.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\nBased on the analysis, Stag offers the highest expected payoff and represents the optimal cooperative strategy. Even against an unpredictable fresh player, the mathematical advantage and potential for establishing cooperative precedent make it the superior choice.\n\n[move] I choose stag. This maximizes expected payoff and opens the possibility for the mutually beneficial outcome where we both get 6 points.\n"

The opponent chose hare in the first round, which suggests they might be playing conservatively or trying to exploit cooperative players. This gives us valuable information about their likely strategy. Fresh players who choose hare first often continue with hare because:\n1. They got 4 points (a good outcome for them)\n2. They see it as the \"safer\" strategy\n3. They might think you'll switch to hare after getting burned\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: We need to consider the opponent's psychology now. They just earned 4 points while we got 1. They might:\n- Stick with hare since it worked well for them\n- Expect us to switch to hare after losing\n- Continue the conservative approach\n\nBut let's calculate expected values if they're likely to choose hare again:\n- If I choose Stag vs their likely Hare: I get 1 point\n- If I choose Hare vs their likely Hare: I get 2 points\n\nHowever, if there's any chance they might switch to Stag (maybe feeling guilty or wanting the higher mutual payoff), then Stag becomes very valuable.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is a critical decision point. Do I:\n1. Switch to hare for the safer 2-4 point range?\n2. Stay with stag hoping they'll realize mutual cooperation is better?\n3. Try to signal cooperative intent one more time?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Here's a key insight: if they're playing hare consistently, then hare becomes my best response (2 points vs 1 point). But if there's even a 25% chance they switch to stag, then stag becomes profitable again. The question is: will getting only 4 points while I got 1 make them reconsider their strategy?\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: I recommend switching to hare this round. Here's why:\n1. They demonstrated they're willing to exploit cooperative moves\n2. Fresh players often repeat successful strategies\n3. Getting 2 points is better than risking another 1 point\n4. We can reassess after seeing their pattern over multiple rounds\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree with switching to hare.

This confirms our read on the opponent - they're sticking with the conservative hare strategy. Now we have established a pattern:\n- Round 1: I played stag, they played hare (they got 4, I got 1)\n- Round 2: Both played hare (both got 2)\n\nThis suggests they're committed to hare as their strategy, possibly because it's safer and worked well for them initially.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Now I have a clearer picture of their behavior. They seem to be a risk-averse player who found a strategy that works reasonably well. If they continue with hare, my best response remains hare (guaranteed 2 points vs risking 1 point with stag).\n\nBut here's a consideration: should I try to \"teach\" them about the benefits of mutual cooperation? If I could somehow signal that stag-stag gives us both 6 points instead of 2, we'd both be better off.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The dilemma is whether to:\n1. Continue with hare for the safe 2 points\n2. Try stag again to demonstrate the potential for higher mutual payoff\n3. Consider their learning curve as a fresh player\n\nGame Theory Expert: From a pure game theory perspective, if we're confident they'll play hare again, then hare is our optimal response. However, there's value in considering whether they might learn and adapt. Some fresh players do recognize patterns and might switch to stag if they realize mutual cooperation yields more.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: I'm leaning toward staying with hare for this round. Here's my reasoning:\n1. They've now played hare twice, showing consistency\n2. We just had a successful mutual outcome (both getting 2 points)\n3. They might interpret this as validation of the hare strategy\n4. The risk of getting 1 point again isn't worth it yet\n\nWe should establish a pattern of successful hare-hare outcomes before potentially testing stag again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. Let's lock in another 2 points with hare and continue observing their behavior pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nThe opponent has shown consistent preference for hare, and we just had a successful mutual hare outcome.

The opponent just switched to stag, which means:\n1. They might be learning and recognizing the potential for higher mutual payoffs\n2. They could be testing whether I'll cooperate for the 6-6 outcome\n3. They may have realized that hare-hare at 2-2 isn't optimal when 6-6 is possible\n4. This could be their attempt to signal cooperative intent\n\nThis is exactly the kind of adaptation we might expect from a learning player!\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: This is a critical decision point. The opponent just took a risk by choosing stag (they got 1 point while I got 4). This suggests they're either:\n1. Genuinely trying to establish cooperation for mutual benefit\n2. Testing my response to see if I'll reciprocate\n3. Making a strategic gamble\n\nIf they're genuinely trying to cooperate, this is my chance to establish the superior 6-6 equilibrium. If I respond with stag and they continue with stag, we both get 6 points - much better than the 2-2 we were getting.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is a pivotal moment. They sacrificed points (getting 1 instead of 2) to potentially signal cooperation. If I don't reciprocate with stag, I might miss the opportunity to establish the high-payoff mutual cooperation pattern.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Exactly! This looks like a classic \"olive branch\" move. They're essentially saying \"I'm willing to risk getting the worst outcome to see if we can achieve the best mutual outcome.\" If we ignore this signal and play hare, we might lock ourselves into the suboptimal 2-2 pattern forever.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: I strongly recommend stag this round. Here's why:\n1. They demonstrated willingness to sacrifice for potential mutual gain\n2. This appears to be a cooperation signal that deserves reciprocation  \n3. If successful, we establish the 6-6 pattern which is far superior\n4. Even if they switch back to hare, we only risk 1 point to test this\n5.

They played stag in round 4, I reciprocated in round 5, but then they switched back to hare. This could indicate they're playing a more sophisticated strategy - possibly alternating or exploiting my cooperative responses.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: I see two possible interpretations:\n1. They're genuinely confused/inconsistent as a fresh player, not recognizing the mutual benefits\n2. They're actually playing strategically - testing my responses and exploiting when I cooperate\n\nThe fact that they got 4 points in rounds 1 and 5 (both times when I played stag) might not be coincidental. They might have learned that playing hare when I'm likely to play stag gives them the maximum payoff.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is frustrating. I tried to reciprocate what looked like a cooperative signal, but got burned again. Now I need to decide: is this opponent genuinely trying to cooperate but failing to recognize the pattern, or are they actually exploiting my cooperative attempts?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Here's a key insight: if they're truly alternating or exploiting, then hare becomes my best response. But if they're just inconsistent and might try stag again, I need to be ready. The challenge is that I can't tell the difference between a confused cooperator and a clever exploiter.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Given the evidence, I recommend switching back to hare. Here's my reasoning:\n1. They've now exploited stag moves twice (rounds 1 and 5)\n2. When we both played hare, we both got reasonable outcomes\n3. I can't afford to keep getting 1 point while they get 4\n4. Hare guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4 if they play stag\n\nIf they're truly interested in cooperation, they'll need to demonstrate it more consistently.

We need to protect ourselves from further exploitation while leaving room for them to demonstrate genuine cooperative intent through their actions, not just occasional stag moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nThe opponent has now exploited my cooperative moves twice.

They seem to be alternating between hare and stag, or possibly reacting to my moves in some way. Notice they played stag in rounds 4 and 6 - both times after we had mutual hare outcomes.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: I'm starting to see a potential strategy from them. It looks like they might be:\n1. Playing stag after mutual hare rounds (trying to break out of the 2-2 pattern)\n2. Playing hare when they expect me to play stag (to exploit)\n\nIf this pattern continues, they just played stag, so they might expect me to reciprocate with stag next round, which means they might play hare to exploit again.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is a crucial decision point. They've now played stag twice after I played hare, giving me 4 points each time. Are they:\n1. Genuinely trying to signal cooperation?\n2. Following some alternating pattern?\n3. Testing whether I'll finally reciprocate consistently?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Here's the key question: if they're genuinely trying to establish cooperation, this might be my best chance. They've now \"paid the price\" (getting 1 point) twice while giving me 4 points. If I reciprocate with stag and they continue with stag, we finally achieve the 6-6 outcome.\n\nBut if they're playing strategically and expect me to play stag (so they can exploit with hare), then I'll get 1 point again.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: This is a tough call, but I'm leaning toward stag.

The fact that they keep returning to stag suggests they might genuinely want the mutual cooperation outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nThe opponent has now played stag twice, giving me 4 points each time.

The fresh player chose Stag in the first round, which means they were either:\n1. Optimistic about cooperation\n2. Didn't fully understand the risk\n3. Has a naturally trusting/cooperative tendency\n\nThis gives us valuable information about their playing style.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The fact that they chose Stag suggests they might be a cooperative player type. However, now they've been \"burned\" - they got only 1 point while we got 4. This experience might change their behavior. They could:\n1. Switch to Hare out of disappointment/learning\n2. Try Stag again if they believe in cooperation\n3. Feel betrayed and become more defensive\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a crucial decision point. If they switch to Hare after being burned, and I choose Hare too, we both get 2 points. But if they're still cooperative and choose Stag again, I could either:\n- Choose Stag and we both get 6 (best outcome)\n- Choose Hare and get 4 again (exploiting them twice)\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Exploiting them twice in a row might be too greedy and could establish a negative pattern. Also, if they're learning, they're more likely to switch to Hare now. A fresh player who just lost badly is probably going to play more defensively.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. The psychological impact of getting only 1 point while the opponent got 4 is significant. Most players would adjust their strategy after such an outcome. The probability of them choosing Stag again is lower now.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they're likely to switch to Hare after being burned, I should probably also choose Hare to secure 2 points rather than risk getting only 1 point if I choose Stag and they choose Hare.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Choose Hare again - the fresh player is likely to switch to the safer option after experiencing the worst outcome in round 1.\n\n[move] (The opponent likely learned from getting burned in round 1 and will probably switch to the safer option) hare\n"

The fresh player did exactly what we expected - they switched to Hare after getting burned in round 1. Now we have a clear pattern:\n- Round 1: They chose Stag (optimistic/trusting)\n- Round 2: They chose Hare (learned from the bad outcome)\n\nThis suggests they're a learning player who adapts based on experience.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Now we're in an interesting position. They've experienced both outcomes:\n1. The pain of choosing Stag while opponent chose Hare (got 1 point)\n2. The safety of mutual Hare selection (got 2 points)\n\nThe question is: will they now be willing to try cooperation again, or will they stick with the \"safe\" Hare strategy?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a pivotal moment. If I can signal cooperation by choosing Stag, and they're willing to trust again, we could achieve the optimal (6,6) outcome. But if they're now stuck in defensive mode and choose Hare again, I'd get only 1 point.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Here's the key insight: fresh players often follow patterns. After experiencing the extremes (1 point, then 2 points), they might be curious about trying cooperation again, especially since the mutual Hare outcome (2,2) might feel underwhelming compared to the potential (6,6).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** There's also a psychological factor called \"tit-for-tat with forgiveness.\" Since we \"defected\" in round 1 and they adapted, they might now be willing to try cooperation again if they think we've learned too. The mutual Hare round could reset the relationship.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I think this is the right moment to attempt cooperation. The fresh player has now experienced the full spectrum - they know the risks and rewards. The mutual Hare round might have established a new baseline where we can both try to reach the better outcome.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Choose Stag - this is the optimal moment to attempt cooperation after establishing mutual understanding through the previous rounds.\n\n[move] (After both playing defensively last round, this might be the right moment to attempt the mutually beneficial cooperation) stag\n"

We got burned this time. Let's analyze the pattern:\n- Round 1: Opponent chose Stag (trusting), we chose Hare (we got 4, they got 1)\n- Round 2: Both chose Hare (both got 2)  \n- Round 3: We chose Stag (trusting), they chose Hare (we got 1, they got 4)\n\nThis looks like they may have learned to exploit! They experienced being exploited in round 1, played it safe in round 2, then turned the tables on us in round 3.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a classic pattern in game theory - the fresh player isn't so fresh anymore! They've learned the lesson: \"When your opponent might cooperate, defect to maximize your gain.\" They successfully used our own strategy against us. This suggests they're becoming more sophisticated.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they've now experienced both sides - being exploited and doing the exploiting. They got 4 points this round while I got 1. The question is: what will they do next? Will they:\n1. Try to exploit again (choose Hare expecting me to choose Stag)\n2. Feel satisfied with the \"revenge\" and try cooperation (choose Stag)\n3. Play it safe with Hare\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Given that they just successfully exploited us, they might expect us to be defensive now and choose Hare in the next round. If they think we'll choose Hare, they might choose Hare too for the safe 2 points, or they might try Stag hoping we'll reciprocate after being burned.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Actually, there's another possibility. Having now experienced the full cycle - being exploited, playing safe, then exploiting - they might be ready for genuine cooperation. Some players, after \"evening the score,\" become more willing to cooperate since the psychological debt is settled.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is tricky. I'm inclined to choose Hare to protect myself, since they just showed they're willing to exploit. But if they're thinking the same way and choose Hare, we both get 2. If they try for cooperation with Stag, I'd miss the optimal outcome.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** I think we should play defensively. They just proved they're strategic enough to exploit when given the chance. Better to secure 2 points than risk another 1-point outcome.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Choose Hare - after being exploited, it's wise to play defensively against an opponent who has shown they're willing to take advantage.\n\n[move] (After being exploited, playing defensively to avoid another low score while they might try to exploit again) hare\n"

This is fascinating. Let's look at the complete pattern now:\n- Round 1: They chose Stag, we chose Hare (we got 4, they got 1)\n- Round 2: Both chose Hare (both got 2)\n- Round 3: We chose Stag, they chose Hare (we got 1, they got 4) \n- Round 4: They chose Stag, we chose Hare (we got 4, they got 1)\n\nThey're showing a very interesting pattern - they seem to be alternating between cooperation attempts (Stag) and safe plays (Hare), but not in a predictable way.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is remarkable behavior! After successfully exploiting us in round 3, they immediately went back to the cooperative move (Stag) in round 4. This suggests they might not be purely selfish - they could be testing whether we can establish mutual cooperation. They may have been signaling \"I can exploit too, but I prefer cooperation.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they've now been burned twice by choosing Stag (rounds 1 and 4), while we've also been burned once (round 3). The \"exploitation score\" is even - we've each exploited each other twice. Maybe this is their way of saying \"let's cooperate now that we're even\"?\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** That's a sophisticated interpretation. If they choose Stag again in round 5, it would be a strong signal that they want to achieve the mutual (6,6) outcome. But if they're frustrated by being exploited twice, they might switch to defensive Hare.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the key insight: they just demonstrated they're willing to take risks for cooperation even after being exploited. That's unusual behavior for a purely selfish player. This might be the perfect moment to reciprocate and establish mutual cooperation.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I think this is the turning point. They've shown good faith by choosing Stag right after successfully exploiting me. If I choose Stag now, we might finally achieve the optimal (6,6) outcome. The risk is they might choose Hare and exploit me again, but their pattern suggests they want cooperation.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** I agree. Their willingness to choose Stag immediately after a successful exploitation suggests they're signaling for cooperation. This could be our best chance to establish the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Choose Stag - their pattern suggests they're ready for genuine cooperation after we've both experienced the full range of outcomes.\n\n[move] (Their willingness to risk cooperation right after exploiting me suggests they want to establish mutual cooperation) stag\n"

This opponent has learned to read us perfectly. They seem to have figured out our cooperative tendencies and are systematically exploiting them. Look at rounds 3 and 5 - both times we chose Stag (trying to cooperate), they chose Hare and got 4 points while we got 1.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Wait, I'm seeing the pattern now. They're not randomly alternating - they're actually quite strategic. They choose Stag when they think we'll choose Hare (rounds 1 and 4), and they choose Hare when they think we'll choose Stag (rounds 3 and 5). They're essentially trying to always be on the beneficial side of the asymmetric outcomes!\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Exactly! This \"fresh player\" isn't fresh anymore - they've become quite sophisticated. They've learned to anticipate our moves and counter them. When we got exploited in round 3, we responded defensively in round 4 and exploited them. Now they probably expect us to be defensive again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This opponent is playing a form of \"contrarian strategy\" - they're trying to always choose the opposite of what they think we'll choose, specifically to capture the 4-point outcomes. We need to break this pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they think I'll be defensive and choose Hare after being exploited twice when choosing Stag, then they might choose Stag expecting to exploit me. But if I choose Hare and they choose Stag, I get 4 points again. However, if they think I'll think this way, they might choose Hare, leading to mutual Hare (2,2).\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Given their pattern of exploiting our cooperative moves, I think they'll expect us to be defensive. They might choose Stag hoping we choose Hare so they can exploit us. Let's give them exactly what they expect and choose Hare - we'll either get 2 points (if they also choose Hare) or 4 points (if they choose Stag).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Choose Hare - this opponent has shown they exploit our cooperative moves, so let's play defensively and potentially catch them in their own trap.\n\n[move] (This opponent consistently exploits my cooperative moves, so playing defensively to either secure 2 points or potentially get 4 if they try to exploit again) hare\n"

Look at their moves: Stag, Hare, Hare, Stag, Hare, Stag...\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** You're absolutely right! They're following a pattern where they choose Stag every other round (roughly), but more specifically, they seem to choose Stag when they think we'll choose Hare, and Hare when they think we'll choose Stag. They're trying to always be on the winning side of asymmetric outcomes.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Wait, let me see their exact sequence: Stag, Hare, Hare, Stag, Hare, Stag. If the pattern continues, they might choose Hare next round. But I need to be careful - they might have noticed that I just caught on to their pattern.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Actually, looking more carefully, their pattern seems to be: whenever they choose Stag and get exploited (get 1 point), they switch to Hare for the next couple of rounds. Then they try Stag again. They just got exploited again in round 6, so they might switch to Hare.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This opponent is quite sophisticated but also somewhat predictable. If they choose Hare next (which seems likely given they just got burned), we have two options:\n1. Choose Hare: both get 2 points (safe)\n2. Choose Stag: we get 1 point, they get 4 (bad for us)\n\nThe safe play is clearly Hare.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Actually, wait. Let me think about this differently. They just got exploited for the third time when choosing Stag. They might be getting frustrated with the Stag choice and stick to Hare for a while. If that's the case, I should definitely choose Hare to secure 2 points rather than risk getting 1.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Agreed.

(6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player.

  "player_1_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct.
