Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluate the strategic considerations:\n   - Continuing to choose hare guarantees me 4 points if they stick with stag\n   - Choosing stag would give us both 6 points if they stick with stag (better for both)\n   - But if they finally switch to hare, choosing stag would give me only 1 point\n\n5.

Analyze the current strategic deadlock:\n   - Both players are stuck in the safe 2-point outcome\n   - We've had two rounds of mutual defensiveness since the betrayal\n   - Neither of us is making the first move to restart cooperation\n   - This creates a prisoner's dilemma about who should risk trusting first\n\n3. Consider the long-term implications:\n   - If we both continue choosing hare indefinitely, we'll keep getting 2 points each\n   - This is better than being exploited (1 point) but much worse than cooperation (6 points)\n   - Someone needs to break this cycle to achieve better outcomes\n   - The question is whether enough time has passed to attempt rebuilding trust\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Continue with hare: Safe 2 points, maintains status quo\n   - Switch to stag: Risk getting 1 point if exploited, but potential for 6 points if they cooperate\n   - The opponent might be thinking the same thing - should they risk trusting first?\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Two rounds of mutual punishment may be enough to reset the relationship\n   - The opponent might be ready to move beyond the defensive phase\n   - Taking the risk to restart cooperation could benefit both of us greatly\n   - If they exploit me again, I'll know they can't be trusted and will stay defensive\n\n[move] (Testing if enough time has passed to rebuild cooperation after the punishment phase) stag"

Consider my opponent's likely expectations:\n   - They probably expect me to eventually try cooperation again\n   - They've successfully trained me to be defensive through repeated betrayals\n   - They might be content with the 2-2 defensive equilibrium since they can't reliably exploit anymore\n   - Or they might be waiting for me to make another trusting move they can exploit\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options going forward:\n   - Continuing with hare guarantees 2 points and prevents exploitation\n   - The opponent has proven twice they will betray cooperation attempts\n   - There's no evidence they're interested in genuine long-term cooperation\n   - Staying defensive is the rational response to a proven exploiter\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - My opponent has clearly established they cannot be trusted\n   - They've had multiple opportunities to cooperate and chose exploitation instead\n   - Maintaining defensive play protects me while still giving reasonable points\n   - I should not give them another opportunity to exploit my trust\n\n[move] (Opponent has repeatedly proven untrustworthy - maintaining defensive strategy) hare"

Consider what this means strategically:\n   - My opponent may have realized that mutual defense (2-2) is suboptimal for both of us\n   - They took the risk I had taken twice before, and got burned just like I did\n   - This could be a genuine attempt to restart cooperation after the defensive phase\n   - Or it could be a calculated move to see if I'll reciprocate or continue exploiting\n\n4. Evaluate my opponent's likely mindset now:\n   - They just experienced being exploited after attempting cooperation\n   - They might understand better how I felt when they betrayed me twice\n   - They could retreat back to defensive play, or they might try cooperation again\n   - This might be a turning point where they're genuinely seeking mutual benefit\n\n5.
