    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, let me understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - They might be risk-averse or risk-seeking\n\n3. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 6 (if they choose stag) or 1 (if they choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 4 (if they choose stag) or 2 (if they choose hare)\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - Stag is high-risk, high-reward: potential for 6 points but risk of only 1\n   - Hare is safer: guaranteed at least 2 points, maximum 4 points\n\n5. Against a fresh player, I should consider:\n   - They might be cautious and choose the safer option (hare)\n   - Or they might be optimistic and go for mutual cooperation (stag)\n   - Without knowing their tendency, hare provides better guaranteed minimum payoff\n\n6. Strategic reasoning: Hare gives me a floor of 2 points and ceiling of 4 points, while stag gives me a floor of 1 point and ceiling of 6 points. Against an unknown player, the safer choice seems better.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare for better risk management against an unknown opponent.\n\n[move] I choose hare because it provides a better guaranteed minimum payoff against an unknown player.\n"
