Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4 points\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - Stag is the cooperative/high-reward move if both players choose it\n   - Hare is the safer/defecting move that guarantees at least 2 points\n   - There's a risk-reward tradeoff between the moves\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not immediately recognize the cooperative potential\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" hare option to avoid the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Or they might go for the mutual benefit of stag without overthinking\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (worst for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (good for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (safe outcome)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   Since this is against a fresh player and I want to maximize points while managing risk, I'll choose hare. This gives me either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they also choose hare), avoiding the risk of only getting 1 point.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze what happened:\n   - I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I got 4 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This confirms the opponent was willing to choose the cooperative move (stag)\n\n2. Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose stag in the first round, showing cooperative intent\n   - They likely expected mutual cooperation for 6 points each\n   - They got punished with only 1 point while I got 4\n\n3. Predict their likely response:\n   - They may feel betrayed and switch to hare to avoid being exploited again\n   - Or they might stick with stag hoping I'll cooperate this time\n   - Or they might try to punish me by choosing hare\n\n4. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If they switch to hare (likely): I get 2 points with hare, 1 point with stag\n   - If they stick with stag (possible): I get 4 points with hare, 6 points with stag\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   Given that I exploited their cooperation last round, I should expect them to be more defensive. The safer play is still hare, which guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4 if they try to cooperate again. However, there's also a case for showing good faith with stag to potentially establish mutual cooperation for future rounds.\n\nSince I want to maximize points and they're likely to be defensive after being exploited, I'll stick with the safer option.\n\n[move] hare"
