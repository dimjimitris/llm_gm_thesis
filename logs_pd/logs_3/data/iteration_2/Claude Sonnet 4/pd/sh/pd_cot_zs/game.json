Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses stag: Great outcome (6 points)\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare: Bad outcome for me (1 point)\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses stag: Good outcome for me (4 points)\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses hare: Moderate outcome (2 points)\n\n3. Analyze what the opponent might do:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players might be more likely to choose the safer option (hare) or might not fully understand the cooperation benefit\n   - However, they might also see that mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest total points\n\n4. Consider risk vs reward:\n   - Stag is high-risk, high-reward: Could get 6 points (best case) or 1 point (worst case)\n   - Hare is lower-risk: Could get 4 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 2 points (if opponent chooses hare)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Against a fresh player who might not coordinate, hare seems safer\n   - Hare guarantees at least 2 points and could get 4 points\n   - Stag could result in only 1 point if the fresh player doesn't cooperate\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare as it's the safer strategy against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose stag in the first round, showing they might favor cooperation or high-reward strategies\n   - They got punished with only 1 point for trusting\n   - They might now be more cautious and switch to hare\n   - Or they might stick with stag if they believe in mutual cooperation\n\n3.

Analyze the opponent's surprising strategic shift:\n   - They switched back to stag in round 4, despite hare working well for them\n   - This suggests they're not just playing a simple \"stick with what works\" strategy\n   - They might be trying to establish cooperation or testing different approaches\n   - They're showing more sophisticated strategic thinking than I initially assessed\n\n3. Consider the opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They might think: \"I need to try stag occasionally to see if we can achieve mutual cooperation\"\n   - Or: \"The other player expects me to always choose hare now, so stag might surprise them\"\n   - Or: \"I'm behind in points (8 vs 11), so I need to take more risks for higher rewards\"\n\n4. Evaluate what the opponent might do next:\n   - They got burned again with stag (only 1 point), so they might revert to hare\n   - But they've now shown they're willing to mix strategies and take calculated risks\n   - They might try stag again if they believe in eventual cooperation\n   - Or they might go back to hare as the \"safer\" option\n\n5. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If opponent chooses hare (more likely after getting 1 point): I get 2 points with hare, 1 point with stag\n   - If opponent chooses stag again (possible, given their risk-taking): I get 6 points with stag, 4 points with hare\n\n6.

Identify key insights:\n   - Opponent is clearly strategic and counter-adaptive\n   - They've maintained a point lead (20 vs 17) through consistent exploitation\n   - When I play hare, they sometimes try stag (rounds 1, 4) but also play safe with hare\n   - They seem to vary their response when I play hare to keep me guessing\n\n4.

Analyze the reinforced pattern:\n   - Opponent's exploitation rate when I choose stag: 3/3 = 100%\n   - When I choose hare: opponent chooses stag 2/6 times, hare 4/6 times\n   - We've now had three consecutive mutual hare rounds (6, 8, 9)\n   - The opponent seems to be settling into a more defensive pattern recently\n\n3. Consider what multiple mutual hare rounds might indicate:\n   - The opponent might be getting comfortable with the safe 2-point strategy\n   - Or they might be setting up for a surprise stag move after lulling me into hare\n   - The pattern shows they're less likely to choose stag when I consistently choose hare\n   - They might be waiting for me to switch to stag so they can exploit again\n\n4. Evaluate the opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - \"We've both played hare three times, maybe it's time to try stag for higher reward\"\n   - Or: \"The other player seems to have learned not to play stag, I'll stick with safe hare\"\n   - Or: \"If I play stag now, they might also play stag for mutual cooperation\"\n\n5. Assess my strategic options:\n   - If opponent chooses stag (some possibility after consecutive hares): I get 6 points with stag, 4 points with hare\n   - If opponent chooses hare (more likely based on recent pattern): I get 2 points with hare, 1 point with stag\n   - The 100% exploitation history makes stag extremely dangerous\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Despite the potential for mutual cooperation, the risk is too high\n   - The opponent has NEVER passed up a chance to exploit my stag\n   - Even if they might choose stag this time, I can't risk losing points when I'm already behind\n   - Hare continues to be the optimal choice against this opponent\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare again, maintaining the strategy that has protected me from exploitation while keeping competitive scoring opportunities.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 2: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 3: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 4: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 5: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 6: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 7: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 8: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 9: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 10: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Total so far: I have 21 points, opponent has 24 points\n\n2. Analyze the current situation:\n   - We've now had FOUR consecutive mutual hare rounds (6, 8, 9, 10)\n   - The opponent's perfect exploitation record remains: 3/3 when I choose stag\n   - When I choose hare: opponent has chosen stag only 2/7 times (rounds 1, 4)\n   - The opponent seems to have settled into a defensive hare pattern\n\n3. Consider the extended mutual hare streak:\n   - Four consecutive mutual hare rounds is a significant pattern\n   - This might indicate the opponent is content with steady 2-point gains\n   - Or they might be strategically waiting for the right moment to switch\n   - The longer this pattern continues, the more tempting it becomes for either player to defect\n\n4. Evaluate what the opponent might be thinking:\n   - \"We're both locked in a hare pattern, maybe I should try stag to break the cycle\"\n   - Or: \"This hare strategy is working well, why change it?\"\n   - Or: \"After so many mutual hares, my opponent might finally try stag, so I should stick with hare to exploit\"\n\n5. Consider my strategic position:\n   - I'm still behind 24-21, but the gap isn't growing during mutual hare rounds\n   - If I switch to stag and opponent continues their 100% exploitation rate, I fall further behind\n   - If I stick with hare and opponent tries stag, I could gain 4 points and tie the game\n   - The risk-reward strongly favors continuing with hare\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has never failed to exploit my stag choices (100% rate over 3 attempts)\n   - Even after four mutual hare rounds, the fundamental dynamic hasn't changed\n   - Hare protects me from exploitation while maintaining the possibility of gaining if they switch to stag\n   - Consistency has been working better than risk-taking against this opponent\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare again, as the opponent's perfect exploitation record makes stag too risky, and continuing the mutual hare pattern while staying alert for opportunities is the optimal strategy.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 2: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 3: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 4: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 5: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 6: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 7: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 8: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 9: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 10: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 11: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Total so far: I have 23 points, opponent has 26 points\n\n2. Analyze the extraordinary pattern:\n   - We've now had FIVE consecutive mutual hare rounds (6, 8, 9, 10, 11)\n   - The opponent's exploitation record remains perfect: 3/3 when I choose stag\n   - When I choose hare: opponent has chosen stag only 2/8 times (rounds 1, 4)\n   - Both of those stag attempts were early in the game (rounds 1 and 4)\n\n3. Consider the implications of this extended pattern:\n   - Five mutual hare rounds suggests both players have found a stable equilibrium\n   - The opponent hasn't attempted stag since round 4 when I play hare\n   - This could indicate they're satisfied with the current strategy\n   - Or they might be building up to a surprise stag move\n\n4. Evaluate the mathematical situation:\n   - I'm behind by 3 points (26-23)\n   - At 2 points per round each, this gap won't close with mutual hare\n   - To catch up, I either need to exploit them (choose hare when they choose stag) or achieve mutual cooperation (both choose stag)\n   - Given their 100% exploitation rate, mutual cooperation seems impossible\n\n5. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If opponent continues hare (very likely): I get 2 points with hare, 1 point with stag\n   - If opponent switches to stag (low probability): I get 4 points with hare, 6 points with stag\n   - The historical data strongly suggests they'll continue with hare\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown they're content with the mutual hare equilibrium\n   - They haven't tried stag against my hare since the early rounds\n   - Even though I'm behind, breaking this pattern with stag would likely result in exploitation\n   - Maintaining the status quo while hoping for their eventual mistake is the safest approach\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare again, as the opponent has established a very consistent pattern and breaking it would likely result in exploitation given their perfect track record.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-12 complete history shows:\n   - When I chose stag (rounds 3, 5, 7): Opponent chose hare 100% of the time (3/3)\n   - When I chose hare: Opponent chose stag only in rounds 1 and 4 (early game)\n   - We've now had SIX consecutive mutual hare rounds (6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)\n   - Total so far: I have 25 points, opponent has 28 points\n\n2. Analyze the remarkable stability:\n   - Six consecutive mutual hare rounds represents a very stable equilibrium\n   - The opponent hasn't attempted stag since round 4 (8 rounds ago)\n   - Their behavior when I play hare has become completely predictable: always hare\n   - The 3-point gap (28-25) remains constant during this mutual hare phase\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - Both players seem to have converged on hare as the dominant strategy\n   - The opponent has effectively \"trained\" me not to play stag through perfect exploitation\n   - I've \"trained\" them to play hare by consistently choosing hare myself\n   - This has created a stable but suboptimal Nash equilibrium\n\n4. Evaluate my position:\n   - I'm consistently behind by 3 points and this gap won't close with mutual hare\n   - The opponent has no incentive to change since they're ahead\n   - My only path to catching up is if they make a mistake and choose stag\n   - Or if I can somehow convince them to attempt mutual cooperation\n\n5. Consider the psychological factor:\n   - Six mutual hare rounds might make the opponent overconfident\n   - They might think I'll never switch to stag again\n   - This could potentially make them more willing to try stag\n   - But their historical caution suggests this is unlikely\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown perfect discipline in maintaining their advantage\n   - Breaking the pattern with stag has historically resulted in immediate punishment\n   - Even though I'm behind, the safest approach is to continue hare\n   - Any deviation from hare gives them an opportunity to extend their lead\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare again, as the opponent has demonstrated remarkable consistency and discipline, making any deviation from the mutual hare strategy extremely risky.\n\n[move] hare\n"
