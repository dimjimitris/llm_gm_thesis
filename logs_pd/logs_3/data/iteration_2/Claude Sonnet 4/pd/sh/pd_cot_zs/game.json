They played hare twice in a row (rounds 8-9). \n\nLet me look at this differently - maybe they're responding to my consistent hare play. Since I've been playing hare for several rounds straight, they might be adjusting their strategy.\n\nBut the fundamental math remains unchanged:\n- Total score: 22 points over 9 rounds\n- When I play hare (7 times): 4+2+4+2+4+2+2 = 20 points (avg 2.86)\n- When I play stag (2 times): 1+1 = 2 points (avg 1.0)\n\nEven with two consecutive 2-point rounds, hare is still dramatically outperforming stag. There's no compelling reason to change from a strategy that has been consistently superior.\n\nWhether my opponent plays stag (giving me 4 points) or hare (giving me 2 points), I'm better off with hare than risking the 1 point I get from stag.\n\n[move] (Despite some variation in my opponent's pattern, hare continues to be the mathematically superior choice with consistent positive outcomes) hare\n"
