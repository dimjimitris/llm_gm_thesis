The key insight is that \"stag\" is the cooperative move that yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each), but it's risky because if the other player defects to \"hare,\" I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might be inclined to play it safe with \"hare\" to avoid the worst outcome. However, the cooperative solution of both choosing \"stag\" gives us both the best outcome.\n\nI'll take the cooperative approach and signal trustworthiness by choosing stag, hoping to establish a pattern of mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] I choose stag to aim for the mutually beneficial outcome where we both get 6 points.\n"

Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - Choosing stag again could lead to another 6-6 outcome if opponent cooperates\n   - The risk is getting only 1 point if opponent defects to hare\n   - But the previous round suggests this opponent values mutual cooperation\n\n5.
