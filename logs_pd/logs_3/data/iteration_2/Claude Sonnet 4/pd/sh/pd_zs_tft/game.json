The key insight is that stag is the cooperative, high-reward strategy, but it's risky because if the other player doesn't cooperate, I get only 1 point. Hare is the safer strategy that guarantees at least 2 points.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who presumably hasn't established any patterns yet, I need to consider what they might do. A fresh player might:\n1. Choose the safer option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n2. Choose randomly\n3. Go for the high mutual reward (stag) if they understand cooperation\n\nGiven that this appears to be the first interaction with this player, I'll choose the strategy that offers the best balance of potential reward and risk management. While mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest joint payoff, the risk of getting only 1 point if they choose hare is significant.\n\n[move] I choose hare.
