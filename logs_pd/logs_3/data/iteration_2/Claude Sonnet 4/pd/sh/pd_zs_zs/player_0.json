You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Both stag: 6 points each\n- Both hare: 2 points each  \n- I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n- I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\nThis is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key insight is that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest joint payoff (6 points each), but it's risky because if the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might be inclined to play it safe with hare (guaranteed at least 2 points) rather than risk the stag strategy. However, they might also see the appeal of the high mutual payoff from both choosing stag.\n\nGiven that this appears to be our first interaction and I want to establish a cooperative tone while also protecting against exploitation, I'll choose stag to signal my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag\n"

The opponent demonstrated they're willing to take the risk for higher mutual payoff rather than playing it safe with hare.\n\nI should continue with this cooperative strategy since it worked well. If they stick with stag again, we'll both get another 6 points. Even if they switch to hare, I'd only lose 5 points (getting 1 instead of 6), but maintaining the cooperative approach could lead to better long-term results if we continue playing multiple rounds.\n\n[move] stag\n"
