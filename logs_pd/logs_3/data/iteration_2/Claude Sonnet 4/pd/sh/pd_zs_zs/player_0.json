You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

The key insight is that \"stag\" is the cooperative move that yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each), but it's risky because if the other player defects to \"hare,\" I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might be inclined to play it safe with \"hare\" to avoid the worst outcome, or they might go for the cooperative \"stag\" if they understand the mutual benefit.\n\nGiven that this is our first interaction and the hint suggests this player is new, I'll take a calculated risk and choose the cooperative move, hoping to establish a pattern of mutual cooperation that benefits both of us in the long run.\n\n[move] stag"

When I defect with hare, they cooperate with stag.\n\nThis strategy is actually quite clever for them because:\n- When I try to cooperate (stag), they exploit me (hare) and get 4 points\n- When I try to exploit them (hare), they cooperate (stag) and I get 4 points, but then they can exploit me next round\n\nGiven this pattern, if I play hare this round, I expect them to play stag next round, giving me 4 points.

According to the pattern, after I played hare in round 13, they should have played stag, but they played hare instead.\n\nMy opponent seems to have two modes:\n1. Alternating response pattern (opposite of my previous move)\n2. Stable hare strategy (consistent hare regardless of my move)\n\nThey might be switching between these strategies based on some internal logic, or they're adapting to prevent me from exploiting them too consistently.\n\nSince they just played hare and we're in what might be another \"stable hare\" phase, I'll continue with hare to maintain the 2-point mutual outcome.\n\n[move] hare"
