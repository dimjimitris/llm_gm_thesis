In the first round, I chose hare and my opponent chose stag, giving me 4 points while they got only 1 point.\n\nNow I have some information about this opponent - they were willing to take the cooperative risk of choosing stag in the first round, even as a \"fresh player.\" This suggests they might be:\n1. Optimistic about cooperation\n2. Willing to take risks for higher rewards\n3. Possibly expecting me to cooperate\n\nHowever, they just experienced getting only 1 point while I got 4, which might make them more cautious this round. They could either:\n- Switch to hare to avoid being exploited again\n- Stick with stag, hoping I'll reciprocate the cooperative gesture\n\nThe dilemma is that if they switch to hare and I choose stag, I'll get the worst outcome (1 point). But if they stick with stag and I also choose stag, we both get the maximum 6 points.\n\nGiven that they showed cooperative intent initially, and the fact that mutual cooperation yields the best joint outcome, I think there's a reasonable chance they might try stag again, especially if they're thinking strategically about building trust.\n\n[move] (Taking a calculated risk based on opponent's previous cooperative behavior) stag"

However, from a pure point-maximization perspective, choosing hare guarantees me 4 points while stag risks only getting 1 if they ever switch strategies.\n\nBut given their consistent pattern of choosing stag across three rounds, even after being exploited twice, it seems like they're committed to the cooperative approach.

Continue the exploitation if I stick with stag\n2.
