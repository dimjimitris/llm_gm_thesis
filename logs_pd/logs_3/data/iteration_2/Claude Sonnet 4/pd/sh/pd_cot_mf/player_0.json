Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluate my options:\n   - The scores are now tied at 17-17\n   - I need to be careful about getting the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Hare guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4 if they choose stag\n\n6. Make the strategic decision:\n   - Given the uncertainty about their new strategy and the tied score\n   - I should play it safe with hare to avoid the 1-point outcome\n   - If they choose stag, I get 4 points; if they choose hare, we both get 2\n\n[move] (Playing safe due to uncertainty about opponent's changed strategy) hare\n"

Analyze the recent pattern change:\n   - Opponent's moves: stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, hare, hare\n   - They've now chosen hare for two consecutive rounds (7 and 8)\n   - This confirms they've moved away from strict alternating\n\n3. Consider what this new pattern might indicate:\n   - They may be switching to a more defensive strategy\n   - After getting exploited multiple times early on, they might be prioritizing safety\n   - Or they could be trying to establish a new pattern of cooperation with hare-hare\n\n4. Predict their likely move for round 9:\n   - If they're now playing defensively, they'll likely stick with hare\n   - If they want to break the hare-hare cycle, they might try stag for cooperation\n   - Given they chose hare twice in a row, another hare seems probable\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they choose hare again: hare vs hare gives us both 2 points\n   - If they choose hare again: stag vs hare gives me 1 point, them 4 points\n   - If they switch to stag: hare vs stag gives me 4 points, them 1 point\n   - If they switch to stag: stag vs stag gives us both 6 points\n\n6. Make the decision:\n   - The scores are tied, so I need to maximize my advantage\n   - If they're likely to choose hare (defensive), then hare is safer (2 vs 1 points)\n   - But if they switch to stag, hare gives me 4 points vs their 1\n   - Hare seems like the better choice given their recent defensive trend\n\n[move] (Continuing with hare given their recent defensive pattern) hare\n"

Evaluate breaking this defensive cycle:\n   - If I choose stag and they continue with hare, I get 1 point and they get 4\n   - If I choose stag and they also choose stag, we both get 6 points (much better)\n   - The risk is getting only 1 point, but the potential reward is 6 points\n\n5.
