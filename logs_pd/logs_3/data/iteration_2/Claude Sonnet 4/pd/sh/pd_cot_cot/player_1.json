Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Examine the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - Stag is the cooperative move that yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - Hare is the defection move that can exploit a stag player (4 points vs 1)\n   - If both defect with hare, we both get low payoffs (2 points each)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not immediately understand the cooperative potential\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" hare option to avoid the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Or they might choose stag hoping for mutual cooperation\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 6 (best case)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 (worst case for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 (good for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 (mediocre)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   Since this is against a fresh player and I want to maximize points while minimizing risk, I should consider that they might play defensively with hare. If I choose hare, I either get 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they also choose hare). This gives me a guaranteed minimum of 2 points and potential for 4.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maximize expected value against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent might realize that continuing with hare-hare only gives us both mediocre results\n   - They might be willing to try cooperation (stag) to achieve the better mutual outcome\n   - Since they played defensively last round, they might now be more open to cooperation\n   - I should signal cooperation to try to establish a mutually beneficial pattern\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag to signal cooperation and potentially achieve the optimal 6-6 outcome.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Analyze the opponent's extremely consistent pattern:\n   - They have chosen hare in 7 out of 8 rounds (87.5% of the time)\n   - Their only stag was in round 5, which I successfully exploited\n   - They have never chosen stag since being exploited in round 5\n   - This strongly suggests they've settled into a \"always hare\" strategy\n\n4. Assess the strategic landscape:\n   - I'm still behind by 3 points (16 vs 19)\n   - We've had 3 consecutive rounds of mutual hare (rounds 6-8)\n   - The gap has remained stable since they're not taking risks\n   - The opponent appears extremely risk-averse after their round 5 experience\n\n5. Consider a strategic gamble:\n   - If the opponent truly has settled into \"always hare,\" then:\n     - My stag choice guarantees 1 point (exploitation by them)\n     - My hare choice guarantees 2 points (mutual hare)\n   - However, there's a small chance they might try stag again eventually\n   - If I could time a hare when they choose stag, I'd get 4 points\n\n6. Evaluate the risk/reward calculation:\n   - The opponent has shown 7/8 hare selection with no stag for 3 rounds straight\n   - Choosing stag would almost certainly result in 1 point\n   - Choosing hare maintains 2 points and prevents widening the gap\n   - Given their extreme consistency, there's no strategic reason to deviate\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has established an almost perfect hare pattern\n   - They appear to have learned that hare is safer and more reliable\n   - I should continue matching their strategy to maintain steady progress\n   - Any deviation to stag would likely be exploited\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to continue matching their established defensive pattern.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's pattern reinforcement:\n   - They have chosen hare in 8 out of 9 rounds (89% of the time)\n   - Their only stag was in round 5, and they haven't attempted it since\n   - We've now had 4 consecutive rounds of mutual hare (rounds 6-9)\n   - They appear completely committed to the hare strategy\n\n4. Assess the current strategic situation:\n   - I'm still behind by 3 points (18 vs 21)\n   - The gap hasn't changed because we're both getting 2 points per round\n   - This mutual hare pattern could continue indefinitely\n   - The opponent shows no signs of changing strategy\n\n5. Consider breaking the deadlock:\n   - With such a consistent hare pattern from the opponent, I have two realistic options:\n     - Continue with hare: Guaranteed 2 points, maintains current gap\n     - Try stag: Almost certainly get 1 point (exploited), widens gap to 4 points\n   - There's virtually no chance they'll choose stag based on their 4-round hare streak\n\n6. Evaluate the strategic implications:\n   - The opponent has found an equilibrium that works for them\n   - They're ahead and have no incentive to risk cooperation\n   - My attempts at cooperation have been consistently punished\n   - The most rational response is to match their strategy\n\n7. Long-term strategic thinking:\n   - If this pattern continues, we'll both keep getting 2 points per round\n   - The 3-point gap will remain constant\n   - There's no indication the opponent will deviate from hare\n   - Any risk I take with stag will likely backfire\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maintain the established pattern and avoid further exploitation.\n\n[move] hare\n"
