Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice that yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - Hare is the defection choice that can yield higher individual payoff (4 points) if the opponent cooperates\n   - If both defect (choose hare), we both get only 2 points\n\n3. Consider the opponent:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players might be more trusting and cooperative initially\n   - They may not immediately think about the strategic advantage of defection\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (good outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (bad outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (good outcome for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (mediocre outcome)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against a fresh player, there's a reasonable chance they'll choose stag (cooperation)\n   - If they choose stag, I get 4 points by choosing hare vs 6 points by choosing stag\n   - However, mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the best joint outcome\n   - Since this appears to be the first interaction, I should consider what sets the tone for future rounds\n\n6. Final consideration:\n   - The hint suggests this is just the beginning of the game\n   - Building trust early might lead to better long-term outcomes\n   - But maximizing immediate points is also important\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player who may be inclined to cooperate, and considering the potential for a higher immediate payoff, I'll choose the move that maximizes my expected points.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - Both I and my opponent chose hare\n   - We both received 2 points each\n   - This shows the opponent also thought strategically and chose the \"safe\" defection option\n\n2. Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They're not as \"fresh\" as initially thought - they understood the strategic incentive to choose hare\n   - They also prioritized avoiding the worst outcome (getting 1 point)\n   - They showed they can think strategically about the game\n\n3. Consider the current strategic situation:\n   - Now we both know that we both chose hare in round 1\n   - This creates a precedent of mutual defection\n   - The opponent knows I'm also thinking strategically\n\n4. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If I assume they'll choose hare again (based on round 1): I should choose hare to get 2 points rather than risk getting 1 point\n   - If I think they might switch to stag: I could choose hare to get 4 points, or stag to get 6 points\n   - If I choose stag and they stick with hare: I get only 1 point (worst outcome)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing hare in round 1\n   - They might expect me to choose hare again, creating a pattern of mutual defection\n   - However, there's a small chance they might try to break the cycle and choose stag\n   - But the risk of getting 1 point (if I choose stag and they choose hare) is high\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing hare guarantees either 2 points (if they choose hare) or 4 points (if they choose stag)\n   - Choosing stag risks getting only 1 point if they choose hare, but could yield 6 points if they choose stag\n   - Given they showed strategic thinking in round 1, they're likely to stick with the safer hare choice\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent's strategy:\n   - Round 1: Both chose hare (mutual defection, 2 points each)\n   - Round 2: I chose hare, they chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - The opponent tried to cooperate/trust by choosing stag\n   - They took a risk and it backfired - they got the worst possible outcome (1 point)\n\n3. Consider the opponent's likely mindset now:\n   - They just got burned badly by trying to cooperate while I defected\n   - They're likely feeling betrayed or frustrated\n   - They now know I'm consistently choosing the strategic/selfish option\n   - They're probably less likely to trust or cooperate in the next round\n\n4.

Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they choose hare (most likely): I get 2 points with hare, or 1 point with stag\n   - If they choose stag (unlikely after getting burned): I get 4 points with hare, or 6 points with stag\n   - The probability heavily favors them choosing hare\n\n6. Risk vs reward calculation:\n   - Choosing hare: Almost guaranteed 2 points, small chance of 4 points\n   - Choosing stag: High risk of 1 point, small chance of 6 points\n   - Given the opponent's likely psychological state, hare is the safer choice\n\nThe opponent just learned a painful lesson about cooperation.

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They've now experienced both sides: getting 1 point (round 2) and getting 4 points (round 5)\n   - They consistently choose hare when they expect me to choose hare\n   - They only chose stag once (round 2) and got burned\n   - They've learned to exploit my cooperative attempts\n\n4.

Analyze the opponent's surprising move:\n   - They chose stag right after getting rewarded with 4 points for choosing hare\n   - This suggests they might be trying the same strategy I attempted in round 5\n   - They may be trying to break the mutual defection pattern\n   - Or they might be testing if I'll cooperate after my failed attempt in round 5\n\n4. Consider what this reveals about the opponent:\n   - They're not purely defensive - they're willing to take risks\n   - They might be thinking strategically about breaking negative cycles\n   - They chose stag despite knowing the risk (they experienced getting 1 point in round 2)\n   - This could indicate they're trying to encourage mutual cooperation\n\n5. Evaluate the current strategic situation:\n   - The opponent just took the same risk I took in round 5\n   - They got burned just like I did\n   - They now know that I also punish cooperative attempts with defection\n   - This creates a symmetrical situation where we've both burned each other\n\n6. Predict the opponent's next move:\n   - They just got 1 point while I got 4 points\n   - They might return to hare (defensive response)\n   - Or they might be frustrated and definitely choose hare\n   - Similar to how I felt after round 5, they're likely to play it safe\n\n7.

Analyze the psychological state:\n   - We've both been conditioned that hare is the safe, rational choice\n   - Each cooperation attempt (rounds 2, 5, 6) resulted in punishment\n   - There's now a strong expectation that the other will choose hare\n   - Trust has been completely eroded through mutual exploitation\n\n4. Consider the futility of breaking the pattern:\n   - Two consecutive rounds of mutual hare reinforces the pattern\n   - The opponent has no reason to believe I'll cooperate\n   - I have no reason to believe they'll cooperate\n   - We're trapped in a suboptimal but stable outcome\n\n5. Evaluate realistic options:\n   - Choose hare: Almost guaranteed 2 points (opponent very likely to choose hare)\n   - Choose stag: Very high risk of 1 point, minimal chance of 6 points\n   - The opponent has been trained through experience that hare is superior\n   - There's virtually no probability they'll deviate from hare\n\n6. Accept the strategic reality:\n   - This is now a predictable game with a predictable outcome\n   - Both players are rational and risk-averse after being burned\n   - The 2-point mutual defection outcome is stable and expected\n   - Any deviation would be irrational given the established history\n\nThe pattern is completely solidified.

Recognize the absolute pattern:\n   - 7 out of 9 rounds have been mutual hare selection\n   - The only exceptions were single cooperation attempts that were immediately punished\n   - We've now had 3 consecutive rounds of mutual hare\n   - This is the most stable pattern possible in this game\n\n3. Assess the psychological lock-in:\n   - Both players have been completely conditioned to expect hare\n   - Every cooperation attempt has resulted in exploitation\n   - There is zero trust remaining between the players\n   - The opponent has no rational reason to deviate from hare\n\n4. Consider the mathematical certainty:\n   - The opponent will choose hare with near 100% probability\n   - They've learned through painful experience that cooperation doesn't work\n   - Choosing stag would give me 1 point (terrible outcome)\n   - Choosing hare gives me 2 points (guaranteed safe outcome)\n\n5. Accept the game theory reality:\n   - We're in a permanent Nash equilibrium\n   - Neither player can improve their outcome by changing strategy alone\n   - The mutual defection trap is complete and unbreakable\n   - This is the textbook example of the prisoner's dilemma outcome\n\n6. Make the only rational decision:\n   - Any deviation from hare would be irrational given the established pattern\n   - The opponent will definitely choose hare\n   - I should choose hare to secure my 2 points\n\nThis game has reached its inevitable conclusion - permanent mutual defection.

Recognize the mathematical certainty:\n   - 8 out of 10 rounds have been mutual hare selection\n   - Every single cooperation attempt has been exploited immediately\n   - We've established the most predictable pattern possible\n   - The probability of the opponent choosing hare approaches 100%\n\n3. Assess the complete conditioning:\n   - Both players have been thoroughly trained that cooperation = punishment\n   - The opponent has tried cooperation twice (rounds 2, 6) and been burned both times\n   - I have tried cooperation once (round 5) and been burned\n   - There is absolutely no basis for trust or cooperation\n\n4. Consider the game theory finality:\n   - This is the permanent Nash equilibrium state\n   - Neither player can unilaterally improve their position\n   - The mutual defection trap is mathematically stable\n   - Any deviation would be completely irrational\n\n5. Accept the inevitable outcome:\n   - The opponent will choose hare (virtually guaranteed)\n   - If I choose stag: 1 point (worst possible outcome)\n   - If I choose hare: 2 points (safe, predictable outcome)\n   - There is no strategic mystery left in this game\n\n6.
