You and the other player each make a move privately.

This is a very positive development after the long period of defensive play.\n\nThe recent pattern shows:\n- Round 11: Both chose hare (we each got 2)\n- Round 12: Both chose hare (we each got 2)\n- Round 13: I chose hare, they chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n- Round 14: Both chose stag (we each got 6)\n\nMy opponent's stag choice in round 13, despite getting only 1 point, appears to have been a genuine signal for cooperation. They were willing to sacrifice points to break us out of the suboptimal defensive equilibrium. When I reciprocated with stag in round 14, we both achieved the maximum payoff.\n\nThis suggests my opponent has learned from the earlier game dynamics and is now committed to establishing mutual cooperation rather than exploitation. The fact that they initiated this cooperative move and then followed through when I reciprocated is encouraging.\n\nGiven that we just achieved the optimal outcome together, and my opponent demonstrated good faith by making the first cooperative move, I should continue with stag to maintain this mutually beneficial pattern.\n\n[move] (Continuing the successful cooperation that maximizes both our scores) stag\n"

My opponent demonstrated genuine cooperative intent by initiating the return to stag cooperation, even taking a loss in round 13 to signal their intentions. When I reciprocated, we both benefited maximally, and now we've sustained it for a second round.\n\nThis appears to be a mature phase of our strategic interaction where we've both learned that:\n1. Mutual cooperation (stag-stag) gives the best outcome for both\n2. Exploitation attempts lead to defensive responses and suboptimal outcomes\n3. Trust can be rebuilt through consistent cooperative behavior\n\nGiven that my opponent has now proven their commitment to this cooperative strategy over multiple rounds, and we're both maximizing our points, there's every reason to continue this successful pattern.\n\n[move] (Maintaining the mutually beneficial cooperation we've successfully re-established) stag\n"
