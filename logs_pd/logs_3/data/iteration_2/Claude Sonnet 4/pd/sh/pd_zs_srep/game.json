Be frustrated that I exploited their stag and become defensive\n\nGiven that they just took a loss (1 point in round 14), they might either:\n- Stay aggressive with stag to try to restore cooperation\n- Switch to defensive hare to avoid further exploitation\n\nI think there's a reasonable chance they'll choose stag again, especially since they broke their previous pattern.
