This pattern suggests they may be consistently choosing the safer hare strategy, either out of caution or because they're deliberately exploiting cooperative players.\n\nAt this point, continuing to choose stag seems unwise since they've shown no indication of reciprocating cooperation. If they keep choosing hare, I'll keep getting only 1 point per round. I need to adapt my strategy.\n\nBy switching to hare, I can guarantee myself at least 2 points if they continue their pattern, or 4 points if they happen to switch to stag.
