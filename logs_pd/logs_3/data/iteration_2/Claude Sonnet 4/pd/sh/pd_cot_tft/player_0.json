Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 2: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 3: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 4: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 5: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 6: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 7: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 8: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Total so far: I have 18 points, opponent has 18 points\n\n2. Analyze the critical development:\n   - The opponent just tied the game at 18-18 points\n   - This is the second time I've tried stag and gotten exploited (rounds 4 and 8)\n   - The opponent has now benefited twice from my cooperative attempts\n   - They seem very committed to the hare strategy, especially when they sense I might cooperate\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's pattern:\n   - They only choose stag when they think I'll choose hare (rounds 1 and 5)\n   - They consistently choose hare when there's any chance I might choose stag\n   - They're playing a defensive counter-strategy, exploiting my cooperative signals\n   - They've successfully closed the point gap through this approach\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - My attempts at cooperation have been consistently punished\n   - The opponent appears to be a sophisticated player who reads my intentions\n   - They're not interested in mutual cooperation, only in exploiting my cooperative moves\n   - I need to adapt to their defensive, opportunistic style\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown they will choose hare whenever they suspect I might choose stag\n   - After just exploiting my stag move, they'll likely expect me to revert to hare\n   - They might try stag again if they think I'll play defensively\n   - But more likely, they'll stick with the hare strategy that has served them well\n   - I should return to hare to avoid further exploitation\n\n[move] (Opponent has successfully exploited my cooperation attempts twice and tied the game, returning to defensive play) hare\n"

Identify the clear pattern:\n   - The opponent chooses stag in rounds 1, 5, and 9 - always when they think I'll choose hare\n   - They choose hare when they suspect I might choose stag (rounds 2-4, 6-8)\n   - This is a very consistent counter-strategy: exploit my defensive moves, defend against my cooperative moves\n   - They're essentially reading my reactions and playing the opposite\n\n3. Analyze opponent's strategic thinking:\n   - After I got burned with stag in round 8, they correctly predicted I'd go defensive with hare\n   - They took the risk of stag and got rewarded with their prediction\n   - They're playing a sophisticated game of psychological prediction\n   - They seem to understand my decision-making patterns\n\n4. Consider what they'll expect next:\n   - I just got 4 points from their stag play\n   - They might think I'll try to exploit them again with hare\n   - Or they might think I'll get greedy and try stag for mutual cooperation\n   - Given their pattern, they'll likely choose hare if they think there's any chance I'll choose stag\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent is playing a reactive strategy based on reading my behavior\n   - They consistently choose hare when they think I might cooperate\n   - After getting 4 points, they'll expect me to either stay defensive or get aggressive\n   - Since they tend to play hare after their stag attempts fail, I should capitalize with hare\n   - This gives me either 4 points (if they try stag again) or 2 points (if they play hare)\n\n[move] (Opponent follows a predictable pattern of playing defensively after their stag attempts, so capitalizing on this) hare\n"

Analyze the cyclical behavior:\n   - After each stag attempt that gets punished, opponent plays hare for safety\n   - They seem to be following a predictable cycle: stag attempt, then multiple hare rounds\n   - This pattern has been consistent across the game\n   - They might be waiting for the \"right moment\" to try stag again\n\n4. Consider my strategic advantage:\n   - I maintain a 3-point lead (24 vs 21)\n   - The opponent's predictable pattern can be exploited\n   - If they're in their defensive phase, they'll likely choose hare\n   - Mutual hare maintains my lead while being safe\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Based on their pattern, opponent is likely to choose hare for at least 1-2 more rounds\n   - They typically wait several rounds after a failed stag attempt before trying again\n   - Since we're only one round past their last stag attempt, they're probably still defensive\n   - I should continue with hare to maintain my lead safely\n   - If they surprise me with stag, I get 4 points; if they play hare, we both get 2\n\n[move] (Opponent appears to be in their defensive phase after their stag attempt, continuing safe play to maintain lead) hare\n"

Consider the opponent's strategic position:\n   - They're falling behind by 3 points (26 vs 23)\n   - Mutual hare play isn't helping them close the gap\n   - They may be getting ready to take another calculated risk with stag\n   - The timing aligns with their historical pattern\n\n4.

Consider the strategic pressure on opponent:\n   - The point gap has grown to 3 points (28 vs 25)\n   - Continuous mutual hare play is slowly widening my lead\n   - They need to take risks to catch up, not just maintain the status quo\n   - The timing aligns perfectly with their historical 4-round cycle\n\n4.
