Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with intuition\n   - They might be risk-averse or risk-seeking\n\n3. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 6 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Stag is high-risk, high-reward (6 or 1 points)\n   - Hare is safer with moderate rewards (4 or 2 points)\n   - Hare guarantees at least 2 points, while stag could give only 1 point\n\n5. Against a fresh player who might be unpredictable, the safer choice of hare seems more strategic. It protects against the worst-case scenario while still offering a good reward if they choose stag.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare for a safer, more consistent strategy against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] hare"

Information from the previous round:\n   - Both players chose hare\n   - This suggests the other player might also be thinking defensively/safely\n   - They got the same 2 points I did\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They seem to be playing cautiously like I was\n   - They might be thinking similarly about risk management\n   - Since they're described as a \"fresh player,\" they might continue with safe choices\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If they continue playing hare (likely given their previous choice), I have two options:\n     * Choose hare again: We both get 2 points (safe but low reward)\n     * Choose stag: I get 1 point, they get 4 points (bad for me)\n   - If they switch to stag (trying to coordinate for mutual benefit):\n     * Choose hare: I get 4 points, they get 1 point (good for me)\n     * Choose stag: We both get 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - The opponent showed cautious behavior last round\n   - They might stick with hare again, making my stag choice risky\n   - However, they might also realize that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest total payoff\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Given they played conservatively last round, they'll likely do so again\n   - Choosing hare gives me either 2 points (if they choose hare) or 4 points (if they choose stag)\n   - This maintains my safety while capitalizing if they try to cooperate\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare to maintain safety and potentially gain advantage if they switch to stag.\n\n[move] hare"

Complete game history analysis:\n   - Rounds 1-4: Both chose hare (2-2 each round)\n   - Round 5: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Round 6: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Round 7: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Rounds 8-10: Both chose hare (2-2 each round)\n   - We're now in a very stable mutual hare pattern again\n\n2. Pattern solidification:\n   - My opponent has chosen hare for three consecutive rounds (8, 9, 10)\n   - After their failed stag attempts, they've clearly returned to safe play\n   - The experimental phase appears completely over\n   - This looks like a return to their original conservative strategy\n\n3. Strategic evaluation:\n   - Both players are locked in a suboptimal but stable 2-2 equilibrium\n   - My opponent has demonstrated they're not interested in sustained cooperation\n   - Their brief attempts at stag were likely exploratory rather than strategic\n   - They seem to prefer guaranteed small gains over risky coordination\n\n4. Risk-reward assessment at this point:\n   - Continuing with hare: Almost guaranteed 2 points given their pattern\n   - Switching to stag: Almost guaranteed 1 point (they'll likely stick with hare)\n   - The cost of attempting cooperation has proven too high\n   - My opponent's behavior suggests they won't reciprocate coordination attempts\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Three consecutive hare choices indicate a very strong pattern\n   - My opponent appears to have settled into pure defensive play\n   - Disrupting this stable pattern would likely only hurt my score\n   - The safe 2-point return continues to be optimal given their predictability\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare to maintain the stable 2-point returns against this predictably conservative opponent.\n\n[move] hare"

Opportunity cost analysis:\n   - We're both consistently getting 2 points per round\n   - The optimal mutual stag would give us both 6 points\n   - We're leaving 4 points per round on the table\n   - But my attempts to break this have historically failed\n\n4. Long-term strategic thinking:\n   - At some point, I might need to signal willingness to cooperate\n   - However, my opponent has shown they revert to hare after any disruption\n   - Four consecutive hare choices suggest they're deeply committed to this strategy\n   - Breaking the pattern now would likely cost me points without gaining cooperation\n\n5. Final decision reasoning:\n   - The pattern is extremely well-established (4 consecutive hare choices)\n   - My opponent appears to have learned that hare is \"safe\"\n   - Any deviation from hare on my part would likely result in only 1 point\n   - The stable 2-point return remains the best realistic option\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare to maintain consistent returns against this highly predictable and conservative opponent.\n\n[move] hare"

Recent outcome analysis:\n   - Round 14: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1, they got 4) \n   - Round 15: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - This is a perfect reversal of the previous round\n   - My opponent broke their seven-round hare streak right after benefiting from it\n\n2. Understanding my opponent's behavior:\n   - After getting 4 points from my stag attempt, they immediately tried stag themselves\n   - This suggests they might be thinking: \"If I just benefited from their cooperation, maybe they'll reciprocate now\"\n   - Or they might be testing if I'll stick with hare after being burned\n   - This could be an attempt at delayed reciprocal cooperation\n\n3. Pattern analysis update:\n   - Rounds 8-13: Both chose hare (stable period)\n   - Round 14: I chose stag, they chose hare (I got burned, they benefited)\n   - Round 15: I chose hare, they chose stag (they got burned, I benefited)\n   - We're now even on the recent \"testing\" exchanges\n\n4.
