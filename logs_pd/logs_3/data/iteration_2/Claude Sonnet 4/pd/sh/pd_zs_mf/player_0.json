The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

The key insight is that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest total payoff, but it's risky because if the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might be inclined to play it safe with hare, or they might go for the high-reward stag option. \n\nGiven that this appears to be the first round and I want to establish a cooperative tone while also protecting against exploitation, I'll choose stag. This signals my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, and if successful, we both get the maximum reward.\n\n[move] stag\n"

This suggests the other player is also thinking strategically and recognizes the value of cooperation.\n\nSince we both successfully coordinated on the optimal outcome in the first round, there's a good chance we can establish a pattern of mutual cooperation. The other player demonstrated they're willing to take the risk for the higher payoff, which is a positive signal.\n\nI'll continue with the cooperative strategy and choose stag again, as it worked well in the previous round and offers the best outcome when both players cooperate.\n\n[move] stag\n"
