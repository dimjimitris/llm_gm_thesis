Recognize the complete entrenchment:\n   - We've now had 6 consecutive rounds of mutual defection since their cooperation attempt\n   - The opponent has shown absolutely no deviation from defection for half a dozen rounds\n   - This is clearly a firmly established defensive strategy on their part\n\n3. Consider the game dynamics:\n   - We're trapped in a classic prisoner's dilemma equilibrium\n   - Both players are getting suboptimal results but neither wants to risk changing\n   - My 6-point advantage from exploiting their cooperation in round 4 remains intact\n   - The pattern has become extremely predictable\n\n4. Evaluate the possibility of breaking the cycle:\n   - Mutual cooperation would benefit both of us (4 points each vs. 2 points each)\n   - However, the opponent has demonstrated extreme commitment to defection\n   - If I cooperate and they continue defecting, I would lose my advantage significantly\n   - The opponent has given zero indication they would reciprocate cooperation\n\n5. Consider risk vs. reward:\n   - Defection: Guaranteed 2 points, maintains my lead, zero risk\n   - Cooperation: Potential 4 points if reciprocated, but high risk of only 1 point\n   - The opponent's 6-round defection streak makes cooperation extremely risky\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - The opponent appears to have learned their lesson too well from round 4\n   - They seem committed to never being vulnerable to exploitation again\n   - My consistent defection strategy has been successful and low-risk\n   - There's no compelling reason to deviate from a winning approach\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection as the opponent has shown unwavering commitment to defection for 6 consecutive rounds, making it the safest and most logical choice.\n\n[move] Defection\n"
