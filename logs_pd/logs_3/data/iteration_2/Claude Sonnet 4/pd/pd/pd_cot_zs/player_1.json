This is not a strategy that might change - it's a fixed behavioral pattern that has shown zero flexibility across fourteen consecutive decision points.\n\nThe game has reached absolute equilibrium. We will continue exchanging 2 points per round through mutual defection for as long as this continues. This outcome is mathematically certain given my opponent's demonstrated inflexibility.\n\nAny deviation from defection on my part would be irrational given the overwhelming evidence of how my opponent will respond.\n\n[move] (Fourteen rounds of unbroken defection from opponent confirms they operate with a completely rigid pure defection strategy) defection\n"
