    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This suggests the other player is also thinking strategically.\n\nNow I need to consider what they might do in this second round:\n- They know I defected last time\n- They also defected, so they understand the game dynamics\n- They might stick with defection since it worked to avoid the worst outcome (1 point)\n- Or they might try cooperation to see if we can achieve the mutually beneficial outcome (4,4)\n\nThe challenge is that if I cooperate hoping they'll cooperate, but they defect again, I'll only get 1 point while they get 6. However, if we both continue defecting, we'll keep getting the suboptimal 2 points each.\n\nSince this is still essentially a one-shot interaction (I don't know if there will be more rounds after this), and the other player already demonstrated they think strategically by defecting first, I should assume they'll likely defect again.\n\n[move] (The opponent already showed strategic thinking by defecting first round, so they'll likely defect again to avoid the risk of getting only 1 point) defection\n"
