Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might be more likely to cooperate initially, as cooperation seems more friendly\n   - They may not immediately think about the strategic advantage of defection\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 4 points (good outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 6 points (best outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (poor outcome)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Defection gives me a chance at the maximum 6 points if they cooperate\n   - Even if they defect, I still get 2 points rather than risking only 1 point\n   - Since this is against a fresh player who might lean toward cooperation, defection could yield the highest expected value\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Cooperating risks getting only 1 point if they defect\n   - Defecting guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6 points\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given that this is against a fresh player who may be inclined to cooperate, and considering that defection protects me from the worst outcome while offering the best potential reward, I should defect.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Risk-reward analysis:\n   - The opponent showed they think strategically by defecting first round\n   - A strategic player might continue defecting or might try cooperation\n   - Defection still protects me from the worst outcome while maintaining upside potential\n   - Since they already showed strategic thinking, they're less likely to be easily exploited\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given that the opponent demonstrated strategic thinking in Round 1 by choosing defection, I should continue with defection to protect against the 1-point outcome while maintaining the possibility of 6 points if they switch to cooperation.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Consider my strategic position:\n   - I'm consistently behind by 5 points but the gap isn't widening\n   - Mutual defection provides stability and predictability\n   - Any cooperation attempt would be extremely risky given their track record\n   - The opponent has had many chances to signal cooperation but hasn't\n\n6. Evaluate the game dynamics:\n   - We appear to be in a stable Nash equilibrium of mutual defection\n   - Both players have learned that cooperation gets exploited\n   - Neither player is willing to be the first to cooperate consistently\n   - This pattern could continue indefinitely\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent's behavior is now highly predictable (defection)\n   - Cooperation would almost certainly be exploited again\n   - Maintaining defection ensures I don't fall further behind\n   - The stable 2-point outcome is better than risking 1-point outcomes\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: With the opponent showing consistent defection behavior across multiple rounds and having exploited cooperation attempts in the past, I should continue with defection to maintain the stable 2-point outcome and avoid falling further behind.\n\n[move] Defection\n"
