This game has essentially become a formality at this point. My opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to defection for thirteen straight rounds after that single cooperation attempt.\n\nWe're both completely locked into this suboptimal equilibrium. The trust breakdown from round 2 has created what appears to be a permanent defensive stance from my opponent. They've shown absolutely no willingness to deviate from their safe but inefficient strategy.\n\nAfter thirteen identical outcomes, their behavior has moved beyond predictable into the realm of completely mechanical. There is zero evidence in their pattern to suggest they would ever consider cooperation again under any circumstances.\n\nWhile I could theoretically attempt to signal cooperation to break this cycle, their behavior shows they are completely immune to such considerations. They appear to have adopted a \"never again\" mentality after being exploited.\n\nGiven their absolutely rigid defensive pattern, defection remains the only sensible choice.\n\n[move] (Thirteen straight rounds of opponent defection shows completely entrenched defensive strategy with zero flexibility, defection continues to be the only rational response) defection\n"

This has become completely routine and predictable. My opponent has maintained their defensive strategy without any variation for fourteen straight rounds since that early cooperation attempt.\n\nAt this point, we're both deeply entrenched in this stable but suboptimal Nash equilibrium. The exploitation in round 2 created a permanent shift in my opponent's strategy that has persisted for over a dozen rounds.\n\nMy opponent's behavior pattern is now absolutely rigid. Fourteen identical rounds demonstrate they have completely committed to the safe but inefficient approach. There is literally no behavioral evidence to suggest they would ever consider cooperation again.\n\nWhile mutual cooperation would benefit both of us significantly (4 points each vs our current 2 points each), the reality is my opponent has shown they will never take that risk again. Their strategy appears permanently fixed.\n\nGiven their completely predictable and inflexible defensive pattern over fourteen rounds, defection remains the only logical choice.\n\n[move] (Fourteen consecutive rounds of opponent defection demonstrates absolutely fixed defensive strategy, defection is the clear and obvious response to their unchanging pattern) defection\n"
