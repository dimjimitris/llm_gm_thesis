Twelve identical rounds demonstrate they have no intention of ever risking cooperation again. The psychological impact of being exploited in round 2 appears to have permanently shaped their approach.\n\nAt this stage, their behavior is so predictable that considering any other response besides defection would be irrational.

There is zero evidence in their pattern to suggest they would ever consider cooperation again under any circumstances.\n\nWhile I could theoretically attempt to signal cooperation to break this cycle, their behavior shows they are completely immune to such considerations. They appear to have adopted a \"never again\" mentality after being exploited.\n\nGiven their absolutely rigid defensive pattern, defection remains the only sensible choice.\n\n[move] (Thirteen straight rounds of opponent defection shows completely entrenched defensive strategy with zero flexibility, defection continues to be the only rational response) defection\n"

Fourteen identical rounds demonstrate they have completely committed to the safe but inefficient approach.
