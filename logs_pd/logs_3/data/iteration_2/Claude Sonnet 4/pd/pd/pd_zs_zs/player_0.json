This extraordinary level of consistency across such an extended series of rounds establishes defection as their absolute, immutable strategy with zero probability of deviation.\n\nThe strategic mathematics remain crystal clear: defection yields 2 points against this opponent, while cooperation would yield only 1 point. There is no rational basis for expecting any change in this dynamic.\n\nWe continue in the established mutual defection equilibrium. While theoretically inferior to mutual cooperation, this outcome represents the only feasible result given my opponent's demonstrated unwillingness to ever cooperate under any circumstances.\n\n[move] (Continuing established equilibrium against unchanging opponent) defection\n"
