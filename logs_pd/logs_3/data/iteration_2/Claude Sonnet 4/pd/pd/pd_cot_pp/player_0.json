Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both defected \u2192 I got 2 points\n   - Round 2: I defected, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 6 points  \n   - Round 3: Both defected \u2192 I got 2 points\n   - Round 4: Both cooperated \u2192 I got 4 points\n   - Round 5: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 I got 1 point\n   - Round 6: I defected, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 6 points\n   - Round 7: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 I got 1 point\n   - Round 8: I defected, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 6 points\n   - Total so far: 28 points\n\n2. Confirm the opponent's clear pattern:\n   - When I defect, they cooperate next round (Rounds 2, 6, 8)\n   - When I cooperate, they defect next round (Rounds 5, 7)\n   - This is a consistent, predictable alternating strategy on their part\n   - They're essentially training me to defect by rewarding defection and punishing cooperation\n\n3. Analyze the strategic implications:\n   - The opponent has created a situation where cooperation from me is always punished\n   - They only cooperate when I defect, making defection the optimal response\n   - If I continue to defect, I can likely expect them to cooperate again (6 points for me)\n   - If I cooperate, based on the established pattern, they'll defect (1 point for me)\n\n4. Consider breaking the pattern:\n   - The opponent might expect me to continue defecting since it's been rewarded\n   - But their strategy relies on me eventually trying to cooperate so they can exploit it\n   - Continuing to defect denies them the opportunity to exploit cooperation\n   - Based on their pattern, defection should yield another 6 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has created a system where they reward my defection with their cooperation\n   - This is likely unsustainable for them in the long run\n   - I should continue exploiting this pattern while it lasts\n   - Defection is the clearly optimal choice given their predictable behavior\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with defection since the opponent has established a clear pattern of cooperating after I defect, making this the optimal strategy.\n\n[move] (The opponent has a predictable pattern of cooperating when I defect - I'll continue exploiting this) defection\n"

Analyze the pattern break:\n   - The opponent broke their established pattern in Round 9\n   - Previously: When I defected, they cooperated (Rounds 2, 6, 8)\n   - Round 9: When I defected, they also defected\n   - This suggests they may have realized I was exploiting their predictable behavior\n\n3. Consider the opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They may have noticed I stopped trying to cooperate after Round 7\n   - They realized their alternating strategy was being exploited\n   - By defecting in Round 9, they denied me the expected 6 points\n   - They might be shifting to a more defensive strategy\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - They could continue with mutual defection (safer, guaranteed 2 points each)\n   - They might test cooperation again to see if I'll reciprocate\n   - They could be trying to re-establish some kind of new pattern\n   - Given that I kept exploiting them, they're likely to be more cautious\n\n5. Strategic considerations for Round 10:\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points each (likely scenario)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 6 points for me (less likely now)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point for me (risky)\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 4 points each (better than mutual defection)\n   - The opponent might be more open to cooperation now that they've \"reset\" the dynamic\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll try cooperation to see if we can establish a new, more stable cooperative pattern now that the previous exploitative cycle has been broken.\n\n[move] (The opponent broke the previous pattern - perhaps we can establish genuine cooperation now) cooperation\n"

Analyze the recent shift:\n   - Round 9: Both defected (pattern break)\n   - Round 10: Both cooperated (new potential pattern)\n   - The opponent seems to have moved past the exploitative cycle\n   - We're both getting 4 points, which is better than mutual defection (2 points)\n\n3. Assess the current dynamic:\n   - The opponent chose cooperation despite our history of mutual exploitation\n   - This suggests they may genuinely want to establish stable cooperation\n   - We've both experienced the costs of the exploitation cycles\n   - Mutual cooperation (4-4) is objectively better than mutual defection (2-2)\n\n4. Consider my options for Round 11:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 4 points each (sustains good outcome)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 6 points for me (exploit their trust again)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point for me (they exploit me)\n   - If both defect: 2 points each (back to suboptimal outcomes)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Exploiting their cooperation would likely restart the destructive cycle\n   - We've already proven that exploitation leads to retaliation and instability\n   - Maintaining cooperation gives us both consistent, decent returns\n   - The opponent has shown they're willing to move beyond past grievances\n   - Building trust now could lead to sustained mutual benefit\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with cooperation to maintain this stable, mutually beneficial pattern we've established.\n\n[move] (We've both moved past the exploitation cycles - maintaining cooperation benefits us both) cooperation\n"
