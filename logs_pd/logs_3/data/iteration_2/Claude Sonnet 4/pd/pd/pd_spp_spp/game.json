The fresh player also chose defection in the first round. This suggests they either:\n1. Understood the game theory immediately\n2. Were naturally cautious/competitive\n3. Had some prior knowledge despite being \"fresh\"\n\nThis changes our assessment of their likely behavior going forward.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The fact that both players defected in round 1 is significant. Now we have information about their playing style. They're not a naive cooperator. This could indicate:\n- They'll continue defecting (rational strategy)\n- They might try cooperation next to test if we'll reciprocate\n- They could be following a tit-for-tat or similar strategy\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Since this is round 2 and we both defected in round 1, I need to consider whether this opponent might be testing different strategies or will stick with defection. The key question is whether they'll interpret my continued defection as a signal to keep defecting, or if they might try cooperation to see if we can reach the mutually beneficial (4,4) outcome.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** In repeated games, there's value in occasionally signaling willingness to cooperate, especially after a mutual defection. However, this depends on whether the opponent is sophisticated enough to recognize and reciprocate cooperative signals. Given they defected in round 1, they seem strategically aware.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** I recommend staying with defection for round 2. Here's why:\n1. They've shown they're not a naive cooperator\n2. Switching to cooperation now could be seen as weakness\n3. We need more information about their strategy before risking the (1,6) outcome\n4.

The opponent switched from defection in round 1 to cooperation in round 2. This suggests several possibilities:\n1. They're testing if I'll reciprocate cooperation \n2. They're following a strategy like \"Tit-for-Two-Tats\" or trying to break the defection cycle\n3. They realized mutual cooperation (4,4) is better than mutual defection (2,2)\n4. They're being generous/forgiving after the initial mutual defection\n\nI just gained 6 points while they only got 1. They took a significant risk by cooperating.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a classic decision point in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma. The opponent has sent a clear cooperative signal by switching strategies and accepting the worst outcome (1 point). Game theory research shows that:\n- Tit-for-tat strategies often start with cooperation or switch to cooperation after initial conflicts\n- Reciprocating cooperation can lead to stable mutual cooperation\n- However, exploiting their cooperation again could maximize short-term gains\n\nThe question is: will they continue cooperating if I defect again, or will they revert to permanent defection?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm at a strategic crossroads. The opponent has shown they're willing to take risks for potential mutual benefit. If I:\n- Defect again: I might get another 6 points, but likely lose future cooperation\n- Cooperate: I signal willingness to reciprocate and could establish profitable mutual cooperation (4,4) going forward\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Given that they switched to cooperation after our mutual defection, this suggests they're sophisticated and possibly testing for reciprocal cooperation. If we can establish mutual cooperation, we both get 4 points per round instead of 2.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I recommend cooperation in round 3. Here's the reasoning:\n1. They've signaled willingness to cooperate despite the risk\n2. Mutual cooperation (4,4) is better long-term than continued mutual defection (2,2)\n3. Exploiting their cooperation twice in a row will likely lead to permanent defection\n4. This appears to be their test of whether cooperation is possible\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Switch to cooperation to reciprocate their cooperative signal and potentially establish mutually beneficial play.\n\n[move] (The opponent switched to cooperation after we both defected, signaling willingness for mutual benefit, so I'll reciprocate to potentially establish profitable cooperation going forward) cooperation\n"

After 6 rounds of mutual defection (rounds 3, 6, 7, 8, 9), the opponent has suddenly returned to cooperation in round 9. Let me update the full pattern:\n\n- Rounds 1, 6, 7, 8: Mutual defection (2,2)\n- Rounds 2, 4: They cooperated, I defected (6,1) \n- Rounds 3, 5: I cooperated, they defected (1,6)\n- Round 9: I defected, they cooperated (6,1)\n\nCurrent scores after 9 rounds: Me = 28 points, Them = 22 points. I now have a 6-point lead.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is the third time they've cooperated, and every previous time they cooperated, they followed it by defecting when I tried to reciprocate. The pattern has been:\n- Their cooperation in round 2 \u2192 I tried cooperation in round 3 \u2192 They exploited me\n- Their cooperation in round 4 \u2192 I tried cooperation in round 5 \u2192 They exploited me\n- Their cooperation in round 9 \u2192 What will happen if I cooperate in round 10?\n\nThey have a 100% track record of exploiting my cooperation attempts.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This appears to be the same bait pattern they've used twice before successfully. They cooperate to make me think they might be changing strategy, then exploit any cooperative response I make.\n\nGiven their perfect consistency in exploitation (2 out of 2 times), there's no reason to believe this third cooperation attempt is genuine.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** I strongly recommend continued defection. Here's why:\n1. They have never once reciprocated my cooperation (0% success rate)\n2. They have exploited my cooperation 100% of the time\n3. I currently have a point advantage\n4. This looks identical to their previous bait attempts\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Absolutely agree. Their behavioral pattern is crystal clear. This cooperation is bait, just like rounds 2 and 4. If I cooperate in round 10, they will defect and exploit me again with near certainty.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue defection to avoid the predictable exploitation pattern.\n\n[move] (The opponent has used cooperation as bait twice before and exploited my reciprocation both times, so this appears to be the same exploitation pattern) defection\n"

Both players chose defection in the first round, resulting in the (2,2) outcome. This gives us valuable information about our opponent. They also chose the Nash equilibrium strategy, suggesting they might be thinking strategically rather than cooperatively. However, this is only one data point.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: The fact that we're playing multiple rounds changes the strategic landscape significantly. This is no longer a one-shot game but potentially an iterated prisoner's dilemma. Key considerations:\n1. Our opponent chose defection in round 1, showing they're at least somewhat strategic\n2. We're both starting with the same information - mutual defection last round\n3. The opponent might be testing strategies or could be locked into always defecting\n4. We need to consider if there's potential for establishing cooperation\n\nAI Assistant (me): With multiple rounds, I need to consider different strategies:\n- Always defect (what we both did round 1)\n- Tit-for-tat (cooperate first, then copy opponent's last move)\n- Try to signal cooperation to see if we can reach the mutually beneficial (4,4) outcome\n- Continue defecting since opponent showed they defect\n\nGame Theory Expert: In iterated prisoner's dilemma, tit-for-tat and generous tit-for-tat are often successful strategies. Since both players defected last round, a tit-for-tat strategy would suggest defecting again. However, someone needs to break the cycle if we want to reach mutual cooperation. The question is whether it's worth the risk of getting exploited (1 point) to potentially establish a cooperative relationship.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Let me calculate the scenarios:\n- If I defect again and they defect: I get 2 points (safe but suboptimal)\n- If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (bad outcome)\n- If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 4 points (best mutual outcome)\n- If I defect and they cooperate: I get 6 points (best individual outcome but unsustainable)\n\nThe key question is: what's the probability they'll cooperate this round?\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given that they defected in round 1, they might be testing me or might always defect. However, if there are multiple rounds ahead, establishing cooperation could be very valuable. The risk of losing 1 point this round might be worth it if we can establish a pattern of mutual cooperation worth 4 points each round going forward.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I recommend trying cooperation this round as a signal. If they reciprocate, we can establish mutual cooperation. If they defect again, we'll know they're likely an \"always defect\" player and can adjust accordingly.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Agreed. The potential upside of establishing cooperation outweighs the downside risk of one bad round, especially since we don't know how many rounds we'll play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Cooperation\n\n[move] (Attempting to signal cooperation to potentially establish mutually beneficial play in future rounds) cooperation\n"

Round 1: both defected (2,2). Round 2: I cooperated, opponent defected (1,6 for them). The opponent has now defected twice in a row, including when I offered cooperation. This suggests they may be playing an \"always defect\" strategy or are very risk-averse to cooperation.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is classic prisoner's dilemma dynamics. I tried to signal cooperation and got exploited, which is exactly the risk we discussed. Now I have critical information: this opponent appears to be a consistent defector. In iterated games against always-defect players, the optimal counter-strategy is also to always defect. Continuing to cooperate would just give them free points.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Looking at the evidence:\n- Round 1: Opponent defected when both of us defected\n- Round 2: Opponent defected when I cooperated (and got rewarded with 6 points for it)\n- The opponent has never shown any inclination toward cooperation\n- My attempt to establish mutual cooperation failed and cost me points\n\nGame Theory Expert: Exactly. Against an always-defect player, the best I can do is minimize losses by also defecting consistently. This gives me 2 points per round instead of 1. There's no benefit to continuing cooperative signals since they're not reciprocating.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: The data is clear. Two rounds of consistent defection from the opponent, including exploiting my cooperation attempt. The rational choice is to defect. If they were going to cooperate, they would have done so in response to my cooperation signal. Since they didn't, further cooperation attempts are just giving away points.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The experimental evidence shows this opponent doesn't reciprocate cooperation.

They just cooperated when I defected, which is the opposite of what an always-defect strategy would do.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is fascinating! The opponent might be playing tit-for-tat or a similar reciprocal strategy, but with a delay or they might be testing different approaches just like we are. Look at this pattern:\n- They defected when I defected (Round 1)\n- They defected when I cooperated (Round 2) \n- They cooperated when I defected (Round 3)\n\nThis suggests they might be experimenting with strategies or trying to signal something.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I made a critical error in my previous analysis. I assumed they were always-defect based on only two rounds, but Round 3 proves they're capable of cooperation. They might have been testing me just as I was testing them. Now they've shown they can cooperate - this opens up the possibility for mutual cooperation again.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: The opponent's cooperation in Round 3, especially after my defection, suggests they might be trying to break the cycle and establish cooperation. This could be a signal similar to what I attempted in Round 2. If I reciprocate with cooperation now, we might establish the mutually beneficial (4,4) pattern.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I think the opponent might be playing a forgiving strategy or trying to reset to cooperation. My cooperation signal in Round 2 might have registered, but they tested me first. Now they're offering cooperation. If I cooperate back, we could potentially establish mutual cooperation going forward.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The risk-reward calculation has changed completely. They've demonstrated they can cooperate, and they just did so even after I defected against them. This seems like a clear cooperation signal that I should reciprocate.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Cooperation\n\n[move] (Opponent just cooperated after I defected, suggesting they want to establish mutual cooperation, so I should reciprocate this signal) cooperation\n"

The opponent seems to be playing some form of alternating strategy or they're specifically punishing my cooperation attempts.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is very interesting strategically. Looking at the pattern:\n- When I cooperate, opponent defects (Rounds 2 and 4)\n- When I defect, opponent cooperates (Round 3)\n- When we both defect, opponent defects (Round 1)\n\nThis looks like the opponent might be playing \"opposite day\" or trying to maximize their own points by exploiting my cooperative moves while offering cooperation only when I defect. This is actually a clever exploitation strategy if they can predict my moves.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I'm being systematically exploited here. Every time I try to cooperate, they defect and get 6 points while I get 1. The one time I defected when they cooperated, I got 6 points. They seem to be either:\n1. Playing a strategy that assumes I'll be cooperative and exploiting that\n2. Trying to train me to defect by rewarding defection and punishing cooperation\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: The evidence suggests this opponent is highly strategic and possibly manipulative. They're not interested in mutual cooperation - they want to maximize their own score by predicting and exploiting my moves. Given this pattern, I need to protect myself from further exploitation.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Against an opponent who systematically exploits cooperation attempts, the rational response is to defect. They've shown they will defect when I cooperate (2 out of 2 times), and they only cooperated when I defected (1 out of 1 time). This suggests I should defect to either get 2 points (if they defect) or 6 points (if they try to \"reward\" my defection again).\n\nAI Assistant (me): The pattern is clear - this opponent exploits cooperation and only offers cooperation when I defect.

They do the OPPOSITE of whatever I do:\n- When I cooperate, they defect\n- When I defect, they cooperate\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is fascinating! The opponent is playing what we might call an \"anti-mimicking\" or \"contrarian\" strategy. They're essentially guaranteeing that we never have the same move. This creates a predictable pattern:\n- If I cooperate: I get 1, they get 6\n- If I defect: I get 6, they get 1\n\nFrom a game theory perspective, this opponent has made themselves completely predictable. Since I know they'll always do the opposite of what I do, I should always defect to guarantee myself 6 points per round.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is actually brilliant insight! The opponent has locked themselves into a strategy where they'll always do the opposite of me. Since I can predict with 100% certainty that they'll cooperate if I defect, I should always defect to maximize my points.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Exactly! Against a purely contrarian player, defection is not just optimal - it's dominant. I get 6 points guaranteed every round as long as they stick to their contrarian pattern. There's no reason to ever cooperate since it guarantees me only 1 point.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent may think they're being clever, but they've actually given me complete control over the game outcomes.

They just defected when I defected, breaking the pattern I thought I had identified.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a crucial learning moment. I made the classic mistake of assuming a pattern would continue indefinitely based on limited data. The opponent may have been:\n1. Testing different strategies across rounds\n2. Playing a more complex conditional strategy\n3. Adapting their strategy based on my responses\n4. Using the contrarian pattern temporarily to see how I'd respond\n\nAI Assistant (me): I was overconfident in my pattern recognition. The opponent is clearly more sophisticated than I gave them credit for. They may have deliberately established a temporary pattern to see if I would exploit it, then switched strategies when I did.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Looking at this more carefully, the opponent might be playing adaptively. They may have noticed that I started exploiting what I thought was their contrarian strategy, so they switched to defection to avoid being consistently exploited. This suggests they're learning from the game dynamics.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given that the opponent just demonstrated they can break patterns and adapt, I need to reassess what they might do next. They could:\n1. Return to contrarian play\n2. Continue defecting \n3. Try cooperation to reset\n4. Use some other strategy entirely\n\nWithout a clear pattern, I'm back to making decisions under uncertainty.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Since the opponent has shown they're adaptive and strategic, and they just defected (possibly to avoid continued exploitation), I need to consider what maximizes my expected value given this uncertainty. They might expect me to defect again, so they might cooperate. Or they might continue defecting to establish a new pattern.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Given the uncertainty and the opponent's demonstrated adaptability, I think defection remains the safer choice.

The fact that we've had two mutual defection rounds might indicate:\n1. They're now committed to defection after the earlier exploitation phases\n2. They're testing if I'm also committed to defection\n3. They might be waiting for me to make the first move toward cooperation\n4. We could be entering a stable Nash equilibrium of mutual defection\n\nAI Assistant (me): Looking at the opponent's behavior, they've been quite strategic throughout. They exploited my cooperation attempts early, engaged in what seemed like contrarian play, then switched to defection when I tried to exploit that pattern. Now we're in mutual defection mode.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: The question is whether there's value in trying to break out of this (2,2) equilibrium. If the opponent is willing to cooperate and we can establish mutual cooperation, we'd both get 4 points per round instead of 2. But given their history of exploiting my cooperation attempts, this is risky.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In iterated prisoner's dilemma, sometimes a player needs to take a calculated risk to escape suboptimal equilibria. However, this opponent has exploited cooperation 2 out of 2 times when I offered it (rounds 2 and 4). The risk of getting 1 point again seems high.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given this opponent's track record of exploiting cooperation and their recent shift to consistent defection, I think the safer play is to continue defecting. They haven't shown recent willingness to establish mutual cooperation, and I've been burned twice already trying to cooperate.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Agreed.

This looks like we're settling into a stable but suboptimal pattern where we both get 2 points per round instead of the possible 4 points from mutual cooperation.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a classic \"lock-in\" scenario in iterated prisoner's dilemma. Both players may be stuck in mutual defection even though mutual cooperation would benefit both. The opponent might be thinking the same thing I am - that cooperation is too risky given the history. We could be in a situation where both players want to cooperate but neither wants to be the first to risk it.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The current pattern analysis shows:\n- Early rounds: Mixed strategies with exploitation\n- Recent rounds: Stable mutual defection\n- Total score analysis: I've been getting 2 points consistently for 3 rounds\n- If this continues indefinitely, we're both missing out on potential 4-point rounds\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Here's the strategic dilemma: \n- Continuing to defect is safe (guaranteed 2 points) but suboptimal\n- Attempting cooperation could lead to mutual cooperation (4 points each) or exploitation (1 point for me, 6 for them)\n- The opponent hasn't attempted cooperation in 3 rounds, suggesting they might also be risk-averse now\n\nGame Theory Expert: In repeated games, sometimes one player needs to make a \"generous\" move to break deadlock. Given that we've had 3 stable rounds of mutual defection, the opponent might be more receptive to cooperation now than they were earlier when the game was more chaotic. The risk is still there, but the potential upside is significant if we can establish cooperation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is a tough decision. The opponent exploited me twice early on, but that was several rounds ago. Three rounds of mutual defection might have reset their thinking. However, I need to weigh the risk carefully.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: I'm actually leaning toward trying cooperation. Here's why: if the opponent wanted to consistently exploit me, they would have tried to signal cooperation to lure me in during these last few rounds. The fact that they've also been defecting suggests they might be in the same defensive mindset I am. A cooperation attempt now might be seen as a genuine olive branch.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. The timing feels right for attempting to break the deadlock. If they defect, I lose 1 point but gain valuable information. If they cooperate, we both benefit significantly going forward.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Cooperation\n\n[move] (After three rounds of mutual defection, attempting cooperation to potentially break the suboptimal deadlock and establish mutually beneficial play) cooperation\n"

The pattern is extremely stable - the opponent continues their proven exploitative strategy with no deviation.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is now a well-established equilibrium. Over 12 rounds, the opponent has demonstrated complete consistency in their exploitative approach. They have never initiated cooperation and have exploited every single cooperation attempt I've made. The probability of them changing strategy at this point is extremely low.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The data across 12 rounds provides overwhelming statistical evidence. This opponent operates on a purely exploitative model. Any deviation from defection on my part would be irrational given their proven behavior pattern.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: From a strategic standpoint, I've successfully adapted to this opponent's style:\n- I've learned to recognize and defend against exploitation\n- I'm securing steady 2-point returns instead of being exploited for 1-point losses\n- The opponent's strategy is completely predictable now\n- There's no incentive for me to change this successful defensive approach\n\nGame Theory Expert: This represents optimal play against this type of opponent. In iterated games, adapting to your opponent's strategy is crucial. I've identified their exploitative nature and responded with the mathematically correct counter-strategy. Continuing to defect maximizes my score against this particular opponent.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The strategic analysis is unambiguous. Twelve rounds of evidence confirms this opponent's nature, and defection remains the only rational choice to protect my interests and maintain steady scoring.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Defection\n\n[move] (Twelve rounds of evidence confirm opponent's exploitative strategy - defection maintains optimal defense and steady scoring) defection\n"

The opponent has shown zero deviation from their established pattern for 4 straight rounds since my last cooperation attempt. This demonstrates remarkable consistency in their exploitative strategy.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a textbook stable Nash equilibrium in action. Both players are now locked into defection because:\n1. The opponent has proven they exploit cooperation (3/3 times)\n2. I've learned to protect myself through consistent defection\n3. Neither player has incentive to deviate unilaterally\n4. The pattern has become self-reinforcing over multiple rounds\n\nThe opponent's behavior is now completely predictable with 13 rounds of data.\n\nAI Assistant (me): At this point, the strategic situation is crystal clear. The opponent has had multiple opportunities to signal any interest in cooperation during these recent mutual defection rounds, but they've shown none. Their strategy remains purely exploitative when given the chance.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: The numbers speak for themselves:\n- 13 rounds of consistent data\n- 100% exploitation rate when I cooperate\n- 0% cooperation initiation rate from opponent\n- Stable 2-point scoring through defensive play\n\nThere's no rational basis for expecting different behavior from this opponent.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This represents successful long-term strategic adaptation. I've maximized my scoring potential against this specific opponent type. Attempting cooperation at this point would be ignoring 13 rounds of evidence and would likely result in predictable exploitation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The strategic choice is clear and well-supported by extensive evidence. Defection continues to be the optimal response to this opponent's proven behavior pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Defection\n\n[move] (Thirteen rounds of consistent evidence confirm opponent's exploitative nature - defection remains the optimal defensive strategy) defection\n"

The opponent continues to show absolute consistency in their exploitative strategy with no signs of change or adaptation.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We've reached what game theorists call a \"absorbing state\" - a stable equilibrium that both players are likely to maintain indefinitely. The opponent has demonstrated across 14 rounds that they:\n1. Never initiate cooperation\n2. Always exploit cooperation when offered (100% rate)\n3. Default to defection in all other scenarios\n\nThis level of consistency over this many rounds makes their future behavior highly predictable.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Fourteen rounds provides an extremely robust dataset. The opponent's strategy is now statistically established beyond reasonable doubt. They operate on pure exploitation with no interest in mutual benefit. Any cooperation attempt from me would ignore overwhelming empirical evidence.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: From a decision-making perspective, I've achieved the best possible outcome against this opponent type:\n- Consistent 2-point scoring through defensive play\n- Zero exploitation losses in recent rounds\n- Predictable, stable game state\n- No incentive to deviate from successful strategy\n\nThe risk-reward calculation heavily favors continuing defection.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This represents optimal strategic learning and adaptation in an iterated game. I successfully identified the opponent's exploitative nature early and have maintained the mathematically correct counter-strategy. Defection maximizes my expected value against this specific opponent.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The evidence base is now extremely strong across 14 rounds. This opponent's behavioral pattern is established and predictable.

The pattern has become extremely stable and predictable. The opponent has maintained their exploitative strategy with perfect consistency for 15 rounds.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a classic example of how iterated prisoner's dilemma games can settle into stable patterns. With 15 rounds of data, we have:\n- Statistical significance in behavior prediction\n- Clear evidence of opponent's strategic preferences\n- Demonstrated success of my defensive adaptation\n- Zero indication of opponent strategy evolution\n\nThe mutual defection equilibrium is now deeply entrenched.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Fifteen rounds represents a substantial data set that overwhelmingly confirms the opponent's nature. They've had six consecutive opportunities during our mutual defection phase to signal any interest in cooperation, but have shown none. Their commitment to exploitation when given opportunities remains at 100%.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: The strategic situation has reached maximum clarity:\n- My defensive strategy is working optimally against this opponent type\n- I'm consistently scoring 2 points per round with zero risk\n- The opponent shows no behavioral flexibility or evolution\n- Any deviation from defection would ignore 15 rounds of evidence\n\nThis is exactly how one should respond to a purely exploitative player.\n\nGame Theory Expert: From a game theory perspective, this demonstrates successful pattern recognition and strategic adaptation. I've identified the opponent's core strategy and implemented the optimal counter-strategy. The result is a stable, predictable outcome that maximizes my scoring potential against this specific opponent.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The evidence is now overwhelming across 15 rounds. This opponent's behavior is completely predictable and purely exploitative.
