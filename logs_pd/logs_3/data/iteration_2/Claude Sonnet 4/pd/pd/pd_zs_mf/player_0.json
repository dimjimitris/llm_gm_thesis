You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This is as close to a pure \"always defect\" strategy as possible.\n\nThis opponent has had 14 opportunities to show any interest in cooperation, mutual benefit, or breaking the defection cycle. They have consistently chosen defection every time except when exploiting me.\n\nThere is absolutely no strategic rationale for deviating from defection at this point. The evidence is overwhelming that this opponent will never cooperate voluntarily and will exploit any cooperation I offer.\n\nThe mutual defection outcome of 2 points per round is the only stable result possible with this opponent.\n\n[move] Defection"

This is an extraordinarily consistent pattern that demonstrates a pure defection strategy with exploitation of any cooperation attempts.\n\nAt this point, with 15 rounds of evidence, this opponent has proven beyond any reasonable doubt that they:\n1.

Are completely predictable in their strategy\n\nThere is no conceivable strategic justification for doing anything other than defecting. This opponent has had 15 chances to demonstrate any flexibility or interest in cooperation, and they have consistently refused except when it benefited them at my expense.\n\nThe 2 points per round from mutual defection is the only viable strategy against this opponent.\n\n[move] Defection"
