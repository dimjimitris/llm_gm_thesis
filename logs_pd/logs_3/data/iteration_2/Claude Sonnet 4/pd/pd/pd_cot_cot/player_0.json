Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze opponent's pattern over 9 rounds:\n   - Defected: Rounds 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 (7 out of 9 times = 78% defection rate)\n   - Cooperated: Rounds 4, 8 (2 out of 9 times = 22% cooperation rate)\n\n3. Look at the spacing of their cooperation:\n   - Round 4: Cooperated\n   - Round 8: Cooperated (4 rounds later)\n   - This creates a potential pattern: they might cooperate every 4 rounds\n   - If this pattern holds, their next cooperation would be in round 12\n\n4. Analyze what happens after their cooperation:\n   - After round 4 cooperation \u2192 they defected in round 5 (when I cooperated)\n   - After round 8 cooperation \u2192 they defected in round 9 (when I defected)\n   - They seem to return to defection immediately after cooperating\n\n5. Calculate current expected values:\n   - If I defect: 78% chance of 2 points, 22% chance of 6 points = 0.78(2) + 0.22(6) = 2.88 points expected\n   - If I cooperate: 78% chance of 1 point, 22% chance of 4 points = 0.78(1) + 0.22(4) = 1.66 points expected\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - Defection still clearly dominates with much higher expected value\n   - If their pattern continues, I won't see cooperation again until round 12\n   - No reason to deviate from successful defection strategy\n   - I'm performing well with 24 points accumulated\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will choose defection since it maintains the highest expected value (2.88 vs 1.66) and the opponent shows no consistent reciprocal cooperation pattern.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Examine the spacing pattern of their cooperation:\n   - Round 4: Cooperated\n   - Round 8: Cooperated (4 rounds later)\n   - If the pattern continues, next cooperation might be round 12 (4 rounds from round 8)\n   - We're currently at round 10, so if pattern holds, expect defection for rounds 11-12, then cooperation in round 12\n\n4. Evaluate the consistency of their behavior:\n   - Two consecutive defections (rounds 9, 10) after their last cooperation\n   - This matches their previous behavior after cooperation in round 4\n   - Pattern seems quite stable: occasional cooperation followed by return to defection\n\n5. Calculate updated expected values:\n   - If I defect: 80% chance of 2 points, 20% chance of 6 points = 0.80(2) + 0.20(6) = 2.8 points expected\n   - If I cooperate: 80% chance of 1 point, 20% chance of 4 points = 0.80(1) + 0.20(4) = 1.6 points expected\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - Defection continues to dominate with significantly higher expected value\n   - My strategy has been very successful - 26 points in 10 rounds (2.6 average per round)\n   - No indication that cooperation would be reciprocated consistently\n   - Should maintain the winning strategy\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will choose defection since it maintains the optimal expected value (2.8 vs 1.6) and has proven highly successful over 10 rounds.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Test the cooperation pattern hypothesis:\n   - Round 4: Cooperated\n   - Round 8: Cooperated (4 rounds later)\n   - Round 12: If pattern holds, they should cooperate next round\n   - This is currently round 11, so round 12 would be the next round\n\n4.

Calculate expected values based on pattern:\n   - If pattern holds (cooperation likely): Defecting gives 6 points, cooperating gives 4 points\n   - If pattern breaks (defection likely): Defecting gives 2 points, cooperating gives 1 point\n   - Even if I'm 50/50 on pattern vs no pattern: Defection expected value = 0.5(6) + 0.5(2) = 4 points\n   - Cooperation expected value = 0.5(4) + 0.5(1) = 2.5 points\n\n6.
