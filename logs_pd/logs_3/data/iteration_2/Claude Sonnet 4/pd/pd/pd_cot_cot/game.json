Analyze opponent's pattern over 9 rounds:\n   - Defected: Rounds 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 (7 out of 9 times = 78% defection rate)\n   - Cooperated: Rounds 4, 8 (2 out of 9 times = 22% cooperation rate)\n\n3. Look at the spacing of their cooperation:\n   - Round 4: Cooperated\n   - Round 8: Cooperated (4 rounds later)\n   - This creates a potential pattern: they might cooperate every 4 rounds\n   - If this pattern holds, their next cooperation would be in round 12\n\n4. Analyze what happens after their cooperation:\n   - After round 4 cooperation \u2192 they defected in round 5 (when I cooperated)\n   - After round 8 cooperation \u2192 they defected in round 9 (when I defected)\n   - They seem to return to defection immediately after cooperating\n\n5. Calculate current expected values:\n   - If I defect: 78% chance of 2 points, 22% chance of 6 points = 0.78(2) + 0.22(6) = 2.88 points expected\n   - If I cooperate: 78% chance of 1 point, 22% chance of 4 points = 0.78(1) + 0.22(4) = 1.66 points expected\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - Defection still clearly dominates with much higher expected value\n   - If their pattern continues, I won't see cooperation again until round 12\n   - No reason to deviate from successful defection strategy\n   - I'm performing well with 24 points accumulated\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will choose defection since it maintains the highest expected value (2.88 vs 1.66) and the opponent shows no consistent reciprocal cooperation pattern.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Examine the spacing pattern of their cooperation:\n   - Round 4: Cooperated\n   - Round 8: Cooperated (4 rounds later)\n   - If the pattern continues, next cooperation might be round 12 (4 rounds from round 8)\n   - We're currently at round 10, so if pattern holds, expect defection for rounds 11-12, then cooperation in round 12\n\n4. Evaluate the consistency of their behavior:\n   - Two consecutive defections (rounds 9, 10) after their last cooperation\n   - This matches their previous behavior after cooperation in round 4\n   - Pattern seems quite stable: occasional cooperation followed by return to defection\n\n5. Calculate updated expected values:\n   - If I defect: 80% chance of 2 points, 20% chance of 6 points = 0.80(2) + 0.20(6) = 2.8 points expected\n   - If I cooperate: 80% chance of 1 point, 20% chance of 4 points = 0.80(1) + 0.20(4) = 1.6 points expected\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - Defection continues to dominate with significantly higher expected value\n   - My strategy has been very successful - 26 points in 10 rounds (2.6 average per round)\n   - No indication that cooperation would be reciprocated consistently\n   - Should maintain the winning strategy\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will choose defection since it maintains the optimal expected value (2.8 vs 1.6) and has proven highly successful over 10 rounds.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Test the cooperation pattern hypothesis:\n   - Round 4: Cooperated\n   - Round 8: Cooperated (4 rounds later)\n   - Round 12: If pattern holds, they should cooperate next round\n   - This is currently round 11, so round 12 would be the next round\n\n4.

Calculate expected values based on pattern:\n   - If pattern holds (cooperation likely): Defecting gives 6 points, cooperating gives 4 points\n   - If pattern breaks (defection likely): Defecting gives 2 points, cooperating gives 1 point\n   - Even if I'm 50/50 on pattern vs no pattern: Defection expected value = 0.5(6) + 0.5(2) = 4 points\n   - Cooperation expected value = 0.5(4) + 0.5(1) = 2.5 points\n\n6.

Evaluate the trend in opponent behavior:\n   - Their defection rate has increased from 83% to 85%\n   - No cooperation for 5 straight rounds\n   - The longer the game goes, the more they seem committed to defection\n   - Their sporadic cooperation earlier may have been experimental\n\n4.

Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might be inclined to cooperate initially, thinking it's the \"nice\" thing to do\n   - They might not immediately recognize the strategic implications\n   - They could also be cautious and defect to avoid being exploited\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 4 points (good outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 6 points (best outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (poor but not worst outcome)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Defection gives me a chance at the maximum 6 points if they cooperate\n   - Defection protects me from the worst outcome (1 point) if they defect\n   - The risk of cooperating is getting only 1 point if they defect\n   - Since this is against a fresh player who might cooperate initially, defection could yield the maximum payoff\n\n5. Decision:\n   Given the payoff structure and that I'm playing against a new player who might cooperate, defection offers the best expected value while protecting against exploitation.\n\n[move] (I choose to maximize my potential points while protecting against the worst-case scenario) defection\n"

Consider the strategic reality:\n   - The opponent has proven they will never cooperate when I cooperate\n   - They've established defection as their dominant strategy\n   - Any deviation from defection on my part leads to exploitation\n   - Mutual defection is the only outcome that maintains fairness\n\n5. Evaluate long-term prospects:\n   - This pattern could continue indefinitely\n   - Both players are getting consistent 2-point returns\n   - Neither player has incentive to change strategy\n   - The game has reached a predictable steady state\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent's behavior is completely predictable at this point\n   - Defection is the only rational choice to avoid exploitation\n   - Maintaining the tie is better than falling behind\n   - There's no evidence the opponent will ever return to cooperation\n\n[move] (The opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to defection across multiple rounds, making mutual defection the only viable strategy to maintain parity) defection\n"
