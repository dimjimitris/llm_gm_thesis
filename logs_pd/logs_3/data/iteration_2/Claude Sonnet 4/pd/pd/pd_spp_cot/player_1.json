Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyzing the strategic deadlock:\n   - We're locked in a Nash equilibrium where both players defect\n   - Neither player has incentive to unilaterally change strategy\n   - The opponent appears committed to defection as the safe choice\n\n3.

Analyzing the opponent's strategy shift:\n   - After three rounds of mutual defection, opponent switched to cooperation\n   - This could indicate: frustration with low scores, attempt to signal cooperation, or testing my response\n   - The opponent took a significant risk and paid the price\n\n3.

Analyzing the opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 4: Opponent cooperated, I defected (opponent got 1, I got 6)\n   - Round 9: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, opponent got 6)\n   - Round 10: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 6, opponent got 1)\n   - The opponent seems to be testing cooperation periodically despite being burned\n\n3. Understanding the strategic dynamic:\n   - The opponent appears willing to occasionally risk cooperation\n   - They might be hoping to establish mutual cooperation despite past failures\n   - However, they also exploit cooperation when I attempt it\n   - This suggests they want cooperation but don't fully trust me\n\n4. Predicting opponent's next move:\n   - After being exploited again, they'll likely return to defection (as they did after round 4)\n   - They've now been burned twice for attempting cooperation\n   - This might make them even more cautious going forward\n\n5. Evaluating my strategic options:\n   - If I cooperate and opponent cooperates: We both get 4 points\n   - If I cooperate and opponent defects: I get 1 point (likely given their pattern)\n   - If I defect and opponent cooperates: I get 6 points (just happened)\n   - If I defect and opponent defects: We both get 2 points (most likely)\n\nThe opponent will probably revert to defection after being exploited, making defection my safest choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue defection as opponent will likely revert to defensive play\n\n[move] (The opponent will likely return to defection after being exploited, making defection the safest response) defection"

Understanding the trust dynamic:\n   - Neither player trusts the other to cooperate simultaneously\n   - Both players exploit cooperation when the opportunity arises\n   - This creates a cycle where cooperation attempts are punished\n   - We're locked in a pattern of mutual distrust\n\n4. Evaluating the current strategic situation:\n   - The opponent just returned to defection after being exploited\n   - They're likely to maintain defection for several rounds (as they did after round 4)\n   - Any cooperation attempt on my part would likely be exploited again\n   - The safest strategy remains defection\n\n5. Long-term strategic assessment:\n   - Both players understand the benefits of mutual cooperation (4 points each)\n   - Both players also understand the risks of unilateral cooperation (1 point vs 6)\n   - Without a way to coordinate or guarantee simultaneous cooperation, we're stuck\n   - The rational choice continues to be defection\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Maintain defection given the established exploitation pattern\n\n[move] (The pattern shows that cooperation attempts are consistently exploited, making defection the only rational choice to avoid being taken advantage of) defection"

Analyzing the strategic lock-in:\n   - We've now played enough rounds to establish very clear behavioral patterns\n   - Both players have demonstrated commitment to risk-averse strategies\n   - The mutual defection equilibrium has proven extremely stable\n   - Any cooperation attempts have been immediately and consistently punished\n\n3.
