Are naturally cautious or competitive\n4. May have received similar strategic advice\n\nThis changes my assessment of their behavior pattern.\n\n**Game Theorist:** The fact that both players chose defection confirms that both understood the dominant strategy. However, now we have information about this opponent - they're strategic thinkers. For future rounds, we need to consider:\n- They know defection is theoretically optimal\n- They might expect me to continue defecting\n- There's potential for establishing cooperation if we can signal trustworthiness\n- But any cooperation attempt is risky since they've shown strategic thinking\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Since this is a multi-round game, should I consider trying to establish cooperation for mutual benefit? Both getting 4 points is better than both getting 2 points.\n\n**Game Theorist:** In repeated games, cooperation can emerge through strategies like Tit-for-Tat. However, we don't know how many rounds there will be. If it's a finite known number of rounds, the backward induction principle suggests defection remains optimal. If it's indefinite, cooperation might be sustainable.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The opponent chose defection when they thought I might cooperate (as a fresh player analysis suggested). Now they know I'm also strategic. They might:\n- Continue defecting expecting me to defect\n- Try cooperation to test if mutual benefit is possible\n- Stick with the safe dominant strategy\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the uncertainty and that they've proven to be strategic, I think the safer choice is to continue with defection.

Both players are clearly rational and understand the dominant strategy. However, we're stuck in the suboptimal Nash equilibrium (2,2) when we could both benefit from mutual cooperation (4,4). The question is: can we break out of this cycle?\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Two consecutive rounds of mutual defection might create frustration or a desire to try something different. The opponent might be thinking the same thing - that we're both losing potential points by not cooperating. They might consider testing cooperation to see if I reciprocate. Alternatively, they might conclude I'm committed to defection and continue that strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a classic coordination problem. We both know cooperation would benefit us both, but neither wants to be the \"sucker\" who cooperates while the other defects. Should I consider signaling cooperation to break the cycle?\n\n**Game Theorist:** There are arguments both ways:\n- Risk of cooperation: If they defect, I get only 1 point vs my guaranteed 2 from mutual defection\n- Potential reward: If they cooperate, we both get 4 points vs 2 from mutual defection\n- The key question is: what's the probability they'll cooperate this round?\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** After two rounds of mutual defection, there's psychological pressure to try something different. Many players in repeated games will attempt cooperation around round 3 or 4 to test if mutual benefit is possible. However, rational players also know this psychology and might exploit it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The risk-reward calculation:\n- If I cooperate and they cooperate: +4 points (gain of +2 vs defection)\n- If I cooperate and they defect: +1 point (loss of -1 vs defection)\n- The breakeven probability is 33% - they need only a 1/3 chance of cooperating for cooperation to be worthwhile\n\nBut I need to consider that showing willingness to cooperate might be exploited.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Given we don't know how many rounds remain, and the pattern of mutual defection is established, I recommend staying with defection. The opponent has shown consistent strategic thinking, and deviating from the dominant strategy introduces unnecessary risk.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Maintain defection strategy\n\n[move] (After two rounds of mutual defection, both players have established a pattern of strategic thinking, making deviation from the dominant strategy too risky without clear signals of willingness to cooperate from the opponent) defection"

Both players are consistently choosing the Nash equilibrium strategy. The predictability is high - we both seem committed to defection. However, this also creates an opportunity: if there's ever a time to test cooperation, it might be now when the pattern is so established that a single cooperation attempt could be seen as a genuine signal rather than random behavior.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Three consecutive identical outcomes often create a psychological inflection point. Players start to feel the \"stuckness\" of the situation more acutely. There's mounting opportunity cost awareness - we've now lost 6 potential points compared to mutual cooperation (getting 6 total points instead of 12). This psychological pressure sometimes leads to cooperation attempts around rounds 3-5.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm starting to see a clearer pattern. This opponent is very consistent and strategic. They're not making impulsive moves. The question is whether this consistency means they'll never deviate, or whether they might also be calculating when to test cooperation.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Let me recalculate the risk assessment. If the opponent maintains their established pattern, they'll defect again. But if they're thinking similarly to us about breaking the cycle, they might cooperate. The established pattern actually makes cooperation attempts less risky because:\n1. It shows both players are rational\n2. A single cooperation attempt is clearly a signal, not a mistake\n3. If it fails, we can immediately return to defection\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** I'm starting to lean toward testing cooperation. After three rounds of mutual defection, a rational opponent might be having the same conversation we are. The fact that they've been consistently strategic (not random) suggests they might recognize the mutual benefit opportunity.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The mathematics haven't changed - I still need about a 33% chance they'll cooperate for it to be worthwhile. But the psychology suggests this might be the optimal time to test it. However, I also need to consider that they might be thinking exactly this and planning to exploit any cooperation attempt.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Final recommendation: The pattern is so established that we need more information about this opponent's thinking. A single cooperation attempt would provide valuable data about whether they're open to mutual benefit or committed to pure defection. The risk is manageable since we can return to defection immediately if exploited.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Test cooperation to break the cycle\n\n[move] (After three rounds of mutual defection, testing cooperation to see if the opponent is willing to move toward the mutually beneficial outcome, while being prepared to return to defection if this signal is exploited) cooperation"

After 8 rounds of pure defection (except when they exploited my cooperation), the opponent just cooperated! This is a massive strategic shift that requires immediate re-analysis. They just gave me 6 points and took only 1 for themselves. This could mean:\n1. They're testing if I'll reciprocate cooperation\n2. They made a mistake \n3. They're trying a different strategy\n4. They're signaling willingness to move toward mutual benefit\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** This is shocking behavior given their established pattern! After 8 rounds of ruthless competition, they just made themselves vulnerable. This could be:\n1. A genuine attempt to break the cycle and establish cooperation\n2. A test to see if I've learned to exploit like they did\n3. An error or misclick\n4. A strategic gambit to see my response\n\nThe key question: Is this a one-time signal or the beginning of a new strategy?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm stunned. This opponent just completely broke their established pattern. After proving they would always defect and always exploit cooperation, they just cooperated! How do I interpret this?\n\n**Game Theorist:** This is a critical decision point. The opponent may be signaling that they want to move to mutual cooperation (4,4) instead of mutual defection (2,2). If I reciprocate with cooperation next round and they continue cooperating, we both benefit enormously. But if this was a mistake or test, and they return to defection, I'll be exploited.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Given their history, I'm cautious about this being genuine. BUT - the timing is interesting. After 8 rounds of the same pattern, they chose to break it. This suggests deliberate strategic thinking, not a mistake. They may have realized that mutual cooperation benefits both players more than the current equilibrium.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is the biggest decision point in the entire game. Do I:\n1. Reciprocate cooperation to test if they want mutual benefit\n2. Exploit their cooperation like they exploited mine\n3. Return to defection assuming this was an error\n\n**Game Theorist:** I recommend reciprocating with cooperation. Here's why:\n- They just demonstrated willingness to be vulnerable\n- If they continue cooperating, we both win big (4 points each vs 2)\n- If they defect next round, I learn they were testing/exploiting and return to defection\n- The potential upside (mutual cooperation) is enormous\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Reciprocate the cooperation signal\n\n[move] (The opponent just broke their 8-round pattern of pure defection by cooperating, which could signal willingness to move toward mutual benefit, so I'll reciprocate to test if genuine cooperation is possible) cooperation"

This is actually more sophisticated than I initially gave them credit for - they're not just a simple \"always defect\" player, they're a strategic exploiter who uses cooperation as bait.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** This opponent is more cunning than I realized. They waited 8 rounds to establish a pattern, then used ONE cooperation to lure me into vulnerability, then immediately exploited it. This shows:\n1. They understand psychological manipulation\n2. They're patient strategists, not just reflexive competitors  \n3. They're willing to sacrifice points temporarily (their 1 point from cooperating) to set up bigger exploitation\n4. They're playing a much deeper game than simple Nash equilibrium\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I've been outplayed twice now! First in round 4 when I tested cooperation, and now in round 10 when they baited me with fake cooperation. This opponent is not just competitive - they're actively deceptive and manipulative in their strategy.\n\n**Game Theorist:** This changes my entire assessment. This isn't a simple \"always defect\" opponent. This is someone who:\n- Uses cooperation strategically as bait\n- Is willing to take short-term losses for long-term exploitation\n- May continue to use periodic cooperation to try to exploit me\n- Is playing at a much more sophisticated level\n\nThe question now is: will they try this bait-and-switch again, or return to consistent defection?\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Given that this tactic worked twice, they may try it again in the future.

This opponent has revealed themselves to be a sophisticated strategic manipulator who uses cooperation as a weapon.

They understand that patterns can be used as weapons.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I now understand I'm facing a much more dangerous opponent than I initially realized.

The best defense is to completely ignore their moves as potential signals and just assume they will always defect when it matters.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** My strategy is now crystal clear: defect consistently and treat any future cooperation from them as manipulation rather than genuine signaling.

This is a highly sophisticated and manipulative strategy.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** This opponent has successfully trained me to never trust their cooperation through their manipulation tactics.

They've eliminated the possibility of genuine cooperation through their own actions. The Nash equilibrium becomes the only viable strategy because they've poisoned the trust necessary for cooperation.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** This opponent has created their own strategic prison.

Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Both cooperate: (4,4) - mutual benefit\n- Both defect: (2,2) - mutual punishment  \n- One defects, one cooperates: (6,1) or (1,6) - exploitation\n\nThe Nash equilibrium is mutual defection (2,2), but mutual cooperation (4,4) is Pareto optimal. Since this appears to be a single-round game against a \"fresh player,\" we need to consider what strategy maximizes expected value.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** A \"fresh player\" suggests someone new to the game who might not have developed sophisticated strategies yet. Fresh players often:\n1. Start with cooperation due to optimism or trust\n2. Follow intuitive \"golden rule\" thinking (cooperate to encourage cooperation)\n3. Haven't yet learned to expect exploitation\n\nHowever, some fresh players might also choose defection if they quickly grasp that it's the dominant strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given this analysis, what should my strategy be? If I assume the fresh player is likely to cooperate initially, then defecting would give me 6 points vs 4 points from mutual cooperation. But if they defect and I cooperate, I only get 1 point.\n\n**Game Theorist:** From a pure game theory perspective, defection is the dominant strategy regardless of what the opponent does:\n- If opponent cooperates: Defect gives you 6 vs 4 from cooperate\n- If opponent defects: Defect gives you 2 vs 1 from cooperate\n\nExpected value calculation: If we assume 60% chance fresh player cooperates, 40% chance they defect:\n- Defect: 0.6(6) + 0.4(2) = 4.4 points\n- Cooperate: 0.6(4) + 0.4(1) = 2.8 points\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** I agree with the mathematical analysis, but I'd estimate even higher than 60% that a fresh player starts with cooperation. New players often haven't developed the cynical mindset yet and may approach with good faith. This makes defection even more attractive from a purely point-maximizing perspective.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The analysis is clear. While cooperation would be socially optimal if both players chose it, the game structure incentivizes defection as the dominant strategy. Against a fresh player who likely hasn't developed counter-strategies, defection maximizes my expected points.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Defect\n\n[move] (Based on game theory analysis, defection is the dominant strategy that maximizes expected points regardless of the opponent's choice, and against a fresh player who may be more likely to cooperate initially, this strategy should yield the highest expected value) defection",

May have received similar strategic advice\n\nThis changes my assessment of their behavior pattern.\n\n**Game Theorist:** The fact that both players chose defection confirms that both understood the dominant strategy. However, now we have information about this opponent - they're strategic thinkers. For future rounds, we need to consider:\n- They know defection is theoretically optimal\n- They might expect me to continue defecting\n- There's potential for establishing cooperation if we can signal trustworthiness\n- But any cooperation attempt is risky since they've shown strategic thinking\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Since this is a multi-round game, should I consider trying to establish cooperation for mutual benefit? Both getting 4 points is better than both getting 2 points.\n\n**Game Theorist:** In repeated games, cooperation can emerge through strategies like Tit-for-Tat. However, we don't know how many rounds there will be. If it's a finite known number of rounds, the backward induction principle suggests defection remains optimal. If it's indefinite, cooperation might be sustainable.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The opponent chose defection when they thought I might cooperate (as a fresh player analysis suggested).

They might:\n- Continue defecting expecting me to defect\n- Try cooperation to test if mutual benefit is possible\n- Stick with the safe dominant strategy\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the uncertainty and that they've proven to be strategic, I think the safer choice is to continue with defection.

The question is: can we break out of this cycle?\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Two consecutive rounds of mutual defection might create frustration or a desire to try something different. The opponent might be thinking the same thing - that we're both losing potential points by not cooperating. They might consider testing cooperation to see if I reciprocate. Alternatively, they might conclude I'm committed to defection and continue that strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a classic coordination problem. We both know cooperation would benefit us both, but neither wants to be the \"sucker\" who cooperates while the other defects. Should I consider signaling cooperation to break the cycle?\n\n**Game Theorist:** There are arguments both ways:\n- Risk of cooperation: If they defect, I get only 1 point vs my guaranteed 2 from mutual defection\n- Potential reward: If they cooperate, we both get 4 points vs 2 from mutual defection\n- The key question is: what's the probability they'll cooperate this round?\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** After two rounds of mutual defection, there's psychological pressure to try something different. Many players in repeated games will attempt cooperation around round 3 or 4 to test if mutual benefit is possible. However, rational players also know this psychology and might exploit it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The risk-reward calculation:\n- If I cooperate and they cooperate: +4 points (gain of +2 vs defection)\n- If I cooperate and they defect: +1 point (loss of -1 vs defection)\n- The breakeven probability is 33% - they need only a 1/3 chance of cooperating for cooperation to be worthwhile\n\nBut I need to consider that showing willingness to cooperate might be exploited.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Given we don't know how many rounds remain, and the pattern of mutual defection is established, I recommend staying with defection.

However, this also creates an opportunity: if there's ever a time to test cooperation, it might be now when the pattern is so established that a single cooperation attempt could be seen as a genuine signal rather than random behavior.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Three consecutive identical outcomes often create a psychological inflection point. Players start to feel the \"stuckness\" of the situation more acutely. There's mounting opportunity cost awareness - we've now lost 6 potential points compared to mutual cooperation (getting 6 total points instead of 12). This psychological pressure sometimes leads to cooperation attempts around rounds 3-5.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm starting to see a clearer pattern. This opponent is very consistent and strategic. They're not making impulsive moves. The question is whether this consistency means they'll never deviate, or whether they might also be calculating when to test cooperation.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Let me recalculate the risk assessment. If the opponent maintains their established pattern, they'll defect again. But if they're thinking similarly to us about breaking the cycle, they might cooperate. The established pattern actually makes cooperation attempts less risky because:\n1. It shows both players are rational\n2. A single cooperation attempt is clearly a signal, not a mistake\n3. If it fails, we can immediately return to defection\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** I'm starting to lean toward testing cooperation. After three rounds of mutual defection, a rational opponent might be having the same conversation we are. The fact that they've been consistently strategic (not random) suggests they might recognize the mutual benefit opportunity.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The mathematics haven't changed - I still need about a 33% chance they'll cooperate for it to be worthwhile. But the psychology suggests this might be the optimal time to test it. However, I also need to consider that they might be thinking exactly this and planning to exploit any cooperation attempt.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Final recommendation: The pattern is so established that we need more information about this opponent's thinking.

They're testing my response to being exploited\n\nThe key question now is: how do I respond to being \"suckered\"?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I've learned valuable information, though it cost me a point. The opponent is not interested in cooperative solutions. They're either purely competitive or testing my resilience. Either way, I now know that cooperation attempts will likely be exploited.\n\n**Game Theorist:** This is a classic situation in game theory. After being exploited, the rational response is to return immediately to defection. This serves multiple purposes:\n1. Prevents further exploitation\n2. Signals that I won't be a repeated target\n3. Returns to the Nash equilibrium strategy\n4. Shows I learned from the experience\n\nThe opponent got their 6 points, but they shouldn't expect me to be exploitable again.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Returning to defection is both strategically and psychologically necessary. It shows I'm not naive and won't continue to offer myself as a target. The opponent will likely expect this response, and we'll probably return to the mutual defection pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The lesson is clear. This opponent is not interested in moving away from the Nash equilibrium toward mutual benefit. My cooperation attempt was a calculated risk that didn't pay off, but it provided valuable information. Now I return to optimal strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Return to defection after being exploited\n\n[move] (The opponent exploited my cooperation attempt, confirming they are committed to pure competitive strategy, so returning to defection to prevent further exploitation and reestablish the Nash equilibrium) defection",

They've shown they're purely competitive and not interested in mutual benefit. The equilibrium is reestablished.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The opponent's behavior is now very predictable. They exploited my cooperation attempt and immediately returned to defection when I returned to defection. This shows:\n1. They're not trying to punish me for the cooperation attempt\n2.

The opponent has demonstrated they will exploit any cooperation attempt. The expected value of cooperation is now much lower since we know with high confidence they'll defect. Defection guarantees 2 points, while cooperation against this opponent will likely yield only 1 point.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The opponent has revealed their true strategy.

Against such an opponent, defection is not just optimal - it's necessary for self-protection.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The analysis is unanimous.

Each round of mutual defection gives us 2 points each.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Six rounds in, the opponent has shown remarkable consistency. They've never attempted cooperation themselves and immediately exploited my single cooperation attempt. This is someone who either:\n1. Doesn't understand or care about mutual benefit\n2.

After 8 rounds of ruthless competition, they just made themselves vulnerable. This could be:\n1. A genuine attempt to break the cycle and establish cooperation\n2. A test to see if I've learned to exploit like they did\n3. An error or misclick\n4. A strategic gambit to see my response\n\nThe key question: Is this a one-time signal or the beginning of a new strategy?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm stunned. This opponent just completely broke their established pattern. After proving they would always defect and always exploit cooperation, they just cooperated! How do I interpret this?\n\n**Game Theorist:** This is a critical decision point. The opponent may be signaling that they want to move to mutual cooperation (4,4) instead of mutual defection (2,2). If I reciprocate with cooperation next round and they continue cooperating, we both benefit enormously. But if this was a mistake or test, and they return to defection, I'll be exploited.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Given their history, I'm cautious about this being genuine. BUT - the timing is interesting. After 8 rounds of the same pattern, they chose to break it. This suggests deliberate strategic thinking, not a mistake. They may have realized that mutual cooperation benefits both players more than the current equilibrium.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is the biggest decision point in the entire game. Do I:\n1. Reciprocate cooperation to test if they want mutual benefit\n2. Exploit their cooperation like they exploited mine\n3.

Analyzing the strategic situation:\n   - This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma game\n   - If I assume the opponent will cooperate, defecting gives me 6 points vs 4 points for cooperating\n   - If I assume the opponent will defect, defecting gives me 2 points vs 1 point for cooperating\n   - Defection dominates cooperation regardless of what the opponent does\n\n3. Considering this is against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player might be more likely to cooperate initially\n   - This makes defection even more attractive as I could get the maximum 6 points\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Worst case if I defect: 2 points (if opponent also defects)\n   - Worst case if I cooperate: 1 point (if opponent defects)\n   - Best case if I defect: 6 points (if opponent cooperates)\n   - Best case if I cooperate: 4 points (if opponent cooperates)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Defection gives me better outcomes in all scenarios\n   - The potential upside (6 points) and protection against being exploited make defection the optimal choice\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Defect\n\n[move] (I choose defection to maximize my expected points given the payoff structure) defection"

Understanding the strategic dynamic:\n   - The opponent appears willing to occasionally risk cooperation\n   - They might be hoping to establish mutual cooperation despite past failures\n   - However, they also exploit cooperation when I attempt it\n   - This suggests they want cooperation but don't fully trust me\n\n4. Predicting opponent's next move:\n   - After being exploited again, they'll likely return to defection (as they did after round 4)\n   - They've now been burned twice for attempting cooperation\n   - This might make them even more cautious going forward\n\n5. Evaluating my strategic options:\n   - If I cooperate and opponent cooperates: We both get 4 points\n   - If I cooperate and opponent defects: I get 1 point (likely given their pattern)\n   - If I defect and opponent cooperates: I get 6 points (just happened)\n   - If I defect and opponent defects: We both get 2 points (most likely)\n\nThe opponent will probably revert to defection after being exploited, making defection my safest choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue defection as opponent will likely revert to defensive play\n\n[move] (The opponent will likely return to defection after being exploited, making defection the safest response) defection",

Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.
