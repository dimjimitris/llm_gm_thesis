Analyze what this reveals:\n   - We're stuck in a mutual defection pattern\n   - Both players are being cautious/defensive\n   - We're both getting suboptimal results (2 points vs potential 4 points)\n   - The opponent seems to be following the same logic I am\n\n3. Consider the strategic situation:\n   - Continuing mutual defection gives us both 2 points per round indefinitely\n   - Mutual cooperation would give us both 4 points per round\n   - But attempting cooperation risks getting only 1 point if the opponent continues defecting\n\n4. Evaluate the risk-reward of breaking the pattern:\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point (very bad)\n   - If I cooperate and they also try to break the pattern: 4 points (very good)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 6 points (best for me)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points (status quo)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent might be thinking the same way - recognizing the suboptimal mutual defection\n   - They might be waiting for someone to \"break the ice\" with cooperation\n   - However, they've shown consistent defection, suggesting they're risk-averse\n   - Breaking first with cooperation is high-risk but could lead to better mutual outcomes\n   - But given their consistent defection pattern, they'll likely defect again\n\n6. Decision:\n   Since the opponent has consistently chosen defection twice, they appear committed to this safe strategy. Taking the risk of cooperation seems unlikely to pay off, and I'd likely get the worst outcome of 1 point. I should stick with defection to maintain the 2-point safety net.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Consider the strategic implications:\n   - The opponent appears to be playing an optimal strategy against someone willing to occasionally cooperate\n   - They maximize their expected value by always defecting\n   - Any deviation from defection on my part will likely be punished\n   - The 2-point rounds are now the ceiling of what I can achieve\n\n4. Evaluate my realistic options:\n   - Continue defection: Maintains stable 2 points per round, keeps gap constant\n   - Attempt cooperation: Almost certain to result in 1 point based on established pattern\n   - The opponent has had multiple opportunities to signal cooperation and never has\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent's strategy is now completely understood and predictable\n   - They will defect regardless of what I do\n   - My best response to pure defection is consistent defection\n   - This minimizes my losses while maintaining predictable outcomes\n\n6.
