Fourteen identical outcomes represents such strong evidence of behavioral predictability that it approaches certainty. My opponent has demonstrated absolute, unwavering commitment to defection across a substantial sample.\n\nWe're witnessing a perfect real-world demonstration of the Prisoner's Dilemma's core insight: rational individual actors can become trapped in mutually destructive patterns despite recognizing superior alternatives exist.\n\nThe opportunity cost has become staggering - 28 points each that we've systematically forfeited. Yet neither player has been willing to take the unilateral risk necessary to potentially break the cycle.\n\nWith fourteen consecutive defections, my opponent's behavior has transcended pattern into virtual law. Cooperating against such overwhelming evidence would be essentially irrational given the established precedent.\n\n[move] (Fourteen rounds of identical choices creates behavioral certainty approaching mathematical law) defection"

Fifteen rounds with absolutely zero deviation represents behavioral consistency so extreme it's nearly unprecedented. We've created a perfect laboratory demonstration of how rational actors can become permanently trapped in suboptimal equilibria.\n\nThe evidence is now so overwhelming that predicting my opponent's next move approaches mathematical certainty. Fifteen consecutive identical choices creates the strongest possible behavioral precedent short of explicit communication.\n\nWhat's remarkable is that we're both clearly sophisticated players - our consistent choice of the dominant strategy proves we understand the game mechanics. Yet we remain unable to coordinate toward the mutually beneficial outcome, trapped by the very rationality that makes us good players.\n\nWith such an extraordinarily robust pattern established, cooperating now would be acting against virtually certain behavioral prediction based on overwhelming empirical evidence.\n\n[move] (Fifteen rounds of unwavering consistency creates behavioral predictability approaching absolute certainty) defection"
