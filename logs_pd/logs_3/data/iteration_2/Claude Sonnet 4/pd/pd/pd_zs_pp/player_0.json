You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

However, defection guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point) and gives me a chance at the best outcome (6 points) if they cooperate.\n\nGiven that this is the first interaction with an unknown player, I'll choose defection as it's the safer strategic choice that protects against being exploited while potentially maximizing my gain.\n\n[move] defection\n"

They use cooperation as bait to try to get me to cooperate, then immediately exploit any cooperative gesture I make. This has been consistent across 14 rounds with zero exceptions.\n\nSince they just cooperated again (as bait), and given their perfect track record of exploiting my cooperation, I will continue defecting to protect myself from systematic exploitation.\n\n[move] defection\n"

When I defect \u2192 They sometimes cooperate (to bait me) and sometimes defect\n\nTheir strategy is designed to maximize their advantage by systematically exploiting any trust or cooperation I show, while using occasional cooperation as bait to lure me into being exploited again.\n\nGiven this established pattern of certain exploitation whenever I cooperate, and the fact that mutual defection (2 points) is much better than being exploited (1 point), I should continue defecting. There is no reason to believe this opponent will ever genuinely cooperate - they have proven they will exploit cooperation 100% of the time.\n\n[move] defection\n"
