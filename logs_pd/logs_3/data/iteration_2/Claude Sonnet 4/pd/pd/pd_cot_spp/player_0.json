Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I took the risk of cooperating after three mutual defections\n   - The opponent exploited my cooperation attempt and got 6 points\n   - This mirrors exactly what I did to them in rounds 2 and 4\n   - They've now \"gotten revenge\" by exploiting me once\n\n3. Consider the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They successfully exploited my cooperation, just as I exploited theirs twice\n   - They might feel satisfied having \"gotten even\"\n   - Or they might continue exploiting if I cooperate again\n   - They've shown they learned from being exploited and can exploit in return\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I just experienced the worst outcome (1 point) for the first time\n   - The opponent has proven they'll exploit cooperation when given the chance\n   - They've now shown the same strategic thinking I used earlier\n   - We're both clearly capable of both cooperation and exploitation\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - The opponent just got their revenge/payback for my earlier exploitations\n   - They might now be more willing to establish mutual cooperation\n   - Or they might continue defecting, having learned the value of exploitation\n   - Defecting next round protects me from further exploitation\n   - But it also signals that cooperation attempts will be punished\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Return to defection as the opponent just demonstrated they'll exploit cooperation, and I need to protect against further exploitation.\n\n[move] (Opponent just exploited my cooperation attempt, so returning to defection for protection) defection\n"

Analyze the recent exchange:\n   - Round 8: I tried cooperation, they exploited me (they got 6, I got 1)\n   - Round 9: They tried cooperation, I exploited them (I got 6, they got 1)\n   - This seems like a \"tit-for-tat\" exchange where we each got our turn at exploitation\n   - We're now \"even\" in terms of exploitation attempts\n\n3. Consider the opponent's strategy:\n   - They exploited my cooperation in Round 8 (revenge for my earlier exploitations)\n   - Then they immediately tried cooperation in Round 9 (testing if I'd reciprocate)\n   - This suggests they may genuinely want to establish mutual cooperation now\n   - They're showing willingness to be vulnerable after getting their \"revenge\"\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - Both players have now experienced both sides: exploitation and being exploited\n   - The opponent is showing a pattern of \"forgiveness\" by cooperating after conflict\n   - They seem to be signaling desire for mutual cooperation\n   - I have 29 points total - I'm doing well but could do better with mutual cooperation\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent just took a risk by cooperating after our mutual exploitation exchange\n   - This could be their attempt to break the cycle and establish trust\n   - If I cooperate now, we might achieve mutual cooperation (4,4) going forward\n   - If I defect again, they might give up on cooperation permanently\n   - Mutual cooperation (4,4) is better long-term than continued mutual defection (2,2)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Try cooperation since the opponent is signaling willingness to move past the exploitation cycle toward mutual benefit.\n\n[move] (Opponent is signaling desire to establish mutual cooperation after our exchange of exploitations) cooperation\n"

Evaluate the current strategic landscape:\n   - Mutual defection (2,2) appears to be the stable equilibrium with this opponent\n   - Any attempt at cooperation from my side gets exploited\n   - The opponent doesn't seem interested in mutual benefit, only in maximizing their own points\n   - I've learned that this particular opponent cannot be trusted with cooperation\n\n4.
