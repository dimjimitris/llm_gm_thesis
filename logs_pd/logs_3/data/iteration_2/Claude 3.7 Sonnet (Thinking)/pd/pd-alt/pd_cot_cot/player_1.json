Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Reviewing the game history:\n   - Fourteen consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation\n   - Both players have consistently earned 6 points per round\n   - My cumulative score is now 84 points (14 \u00d7 6)\n\n2. Analyzing my opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - They have demonstrated unwavering commitment to cooperation through fourteen rounds\n   - Their strategy shows remarkable consistency and reliability\n   - No indication of any intention to deviate has been observed\n\n3. Evaluating potential outcomes for this round:\n   - If I cooperate (and opponent cooperates as pattern suggests): 6 points\n   - If I defect (and opponent cooperates): 4 points\n   - Defection would actually yield FEWER points this round\n\n4. Considering long-term implications:\n   - Our established cooperative equilibrium has consistently produced optimal results\n   - Defecting would disrupt fourteen rounds of successful mutual benefit\n   - Any deviation would likely lead to suboptimal outcomes in future rounds\n\n5. Based on all available evidence and rational decision theory, continuing cooperation remains the clear optimal strategy.\n\n[move] Cooperation"

Evaluating my opponent's demonstrated strategy:\n   - They have maintained perfect cooperation across all fifteen rounds\n   - This level of consistency indicates an extremely stable and reliable approach\n   - The probability of continued cooperation appears very high based on past behavior\n\n3. Comparing potential outcomes:\n   - Mutual cooperation: 6 points each (optimal mutual outcome)\n   - If I defect while they cooperate: I would get only 4 points (actually FEWER than cooperation)\n   - Defection offers no advantage, even in the short term\n\n4. Applying game theory principles:\n   - Our established pattern represents a stable Nash equilibrium\n   - Fifteen rounds of evidence confirm the success of this strategy\n   - Deviation would reduce both immediate and expected future returns\n\n5.
