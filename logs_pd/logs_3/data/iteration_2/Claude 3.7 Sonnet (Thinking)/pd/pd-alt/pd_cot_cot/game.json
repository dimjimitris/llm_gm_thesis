This strongly suggests they are following a cooperative strategy and understand the benefits of mutual cooperation. There's no indication they plan to defect.\n\nOptions for this round:\n1. Continue cooperating:\n   - If opponent also cooperates (highly likely based on history): I get 6 points\n   - If opponent suddenly defects (unlikely based on history): I get 1 point\n\n2. Defect:\n   - If opponent cooperates (likely based on history): I get 4 points\n   - If opponent defects: I get 2 points\n\nGame theory considerations:\n- In repeated games with unknown endpoints, sustained cooperation is typically the optimal strategy\n- The established pattern of mutual cooperation (6 points each) is superior to the Nash equilibrium of mutual defection (2 points each)\n- Defecting now would yield fewer points (4 instead of 6) and likely damage the cooperative relationship\n- Breaking trust after 11 rounds would probably lead to retaliatory defection and lower future payoffs\n\nDecision:\nIt makes most sense to continue cooperating. This maintains our optimal mutual outcome and continues the established pattern of trust. There's no rational reason to deviate from a strategy that has consistently yielded the maximum mutual benefit.",
