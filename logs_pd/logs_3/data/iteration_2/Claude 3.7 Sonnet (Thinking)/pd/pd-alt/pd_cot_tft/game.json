We seem to have settled into mutual defection recently, with occasional deviations.\n\n4. My point outcomes have been:\n   - When cooperating: always 1 point (100% of the time)\n   - When defecting: either 4 points or 2 points (both better than 1)\n\n5. Despite multiple attempts to establish cooperation, the opponent has shown no willingness to reciprocate.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on the established pattern across 14 rounds, defection remains the rational choice.\n\n[move] (Continuing with defection based on the opponent's consistent pattern of exploitation) defection",

This is a 100% rate of exploitation.\n2. When I defect, sometimes they cooperate (rounds 2, 4, 7, 12) and sometimes they defect.\n3. We've now had several rounds of mutual defection, which gives us both 2 points each round.\n4. The pattern seems to be that after several rounds of mutual defection, if I cooperate, they still defect.\n\nLet me consider my options:\n- If I cooperate: Based on all past evidence (4 instances), opponent will likely defect, giving me 1 point\n- If I defect: Based on recent pattern, opponent will likely defect, giving me 2 points\n\nWhile mutual cooperation (6 points each) would be ideal, I've repeatedly found that the opponent will not reciprocate cooperation. Even the suboptimal mutual defection equilibrium (2 points) is better than the 1 point I consistently get when I cooperate.\n\nAfter 14 rounds, I have sufficient evidence to conclude that defection is the optimal strategy against this opponent.",

We seem to have settled into a mutual defection equilibrium for the last 3 rounds.\n\n4. The dominant strategy remains defection, as it always yields better results than cooperation:\n   - Worst case with defection: 2 points\n   - Best case with cooperation: 6 points (but this has never happened)\n   - Actual results with cooperation: always 1 point\n\n5. We've been stuck in mutual defection for several rounds now. Is there any reason to think cooperation might work this time?\n   - The opponent has never once reciprocated cooperation\n   - They have exploited cooperation 100% of the time\n   - Even though mutual defection (2 points each) is worse than mutual cooperation (6 points each), there's no evidence the opponent wants mutual cooperation\n\nThe rational choice continues to be defection.
