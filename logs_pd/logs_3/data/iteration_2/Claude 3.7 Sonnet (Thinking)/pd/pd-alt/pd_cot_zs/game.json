In each round, both my opponent and I have chosen to cooperate.\n3. This has resulted in each of us earning 6 points per round - the optimal collective outcome.\n4. My opponent has demonstrated complete reliability by cooperating in all 15 previous rounds.\n5. This established pattern shows a strong commitment to cooperation from both sides.\n\nLet me consider the game theory implications:\n- If we both continue cooperating, we each get 6 points\n- If I defect while my opponent cooperates (based on our history), I would get 4 points and they would get 1 point\n- This would likely break trust and lead to mutual defection in future rounds\n- Mutual defection would result in only 2 points each - significantly worse than our current arrangement\n\nThe decision seems clear: there's no rational reason to deviate from our established pattern of cooperation. Our mutual cooperation strategy has been working perfectly for 15 rounds, and the mathematical advantage of continued cooperation in repeated interactions remains strong.\n\nI'll continue with cooperation for this round.",
