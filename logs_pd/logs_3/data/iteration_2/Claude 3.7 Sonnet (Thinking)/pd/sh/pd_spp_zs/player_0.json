    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Let me use a collaborative approach to develop a strategy.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Rational Decision Maker, Psychological Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game. There are two Nash equilibria: both players choosing stag (6,6) or both choosing hare (2,2). The stag-stag outcome is Pareto optimal, offering the highest mutual benefit. However, choosing stag is riskier because if your opponent chooses hare, you only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nPsychological Strategist: In the first round, players often lean toward cooperation, especially when there's potential for mutual benefit. Since this is a fresh player with no history, they might be inclined to choose stag for maximum mutual benefit.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Let's analyze the expected values. If we assume the opponent chooses stag or hare with equal probability:\n- Choosing stag: 50% chance of 6 points + 50% chance of 1 point = 3.5 points on average\n- Choosing hare: 50% chance of 4 points + 50% chance of 2 points = 3 points on average\n\nGame Theorist: While the expected value slightly favors choosing stag, there's also the risk-dominance consideration. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, while choosing stag could leave you with just 1 point if the opponent doesn't cooperate.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since this is the first move with a fresh player, I recommend choosing stag. It signals cooperation and willingness to achieve mutual benefit, which might encourage the other player to also choose stag in subsequent rounds.\n\nRational Decision Maker: I agree. The slight expected value advantage and the potential to establish a cooperative pattern makes stag the optimal first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate for mutual benefit."

This suggests both players understand the benefits of cooperation.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since the other player chose stag in the first round, they've signaled a willingness to cooperate. People tend to stick with successful strategies, so there's a good probability they'll continue choosing stag.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Looking at expected values: if we believe there's a high probability the opponent will choose stag again (based on their previous move), then our best response is to also choose stag to maximize our points.\n\nGame Theorist: The risk of defection always exists, but maintaining the Pareto optimal equilibrium (stag-stag) benefits both players more than shifting to the risk-dominant equilibrium (hare-hare).\n\nPsychological Strategist: Continuing with stag reinforces the cooperative relationship we've established. Switching to hare now could break trust and potentially lead to worse outcomes in future rounds.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Since we have evidence of cooperation and no reason to suspect defection, stag remains the optimal choice to maximize expected points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Continuing cooperation for mutual benefit based on our successful first round."
