The (stag, stag) outcome is Pareto optimal, giving both of us the maximum possible points (6 each). However, it's riskier because if my opponent chooses hare while I choose stag, I only get 1 point.\n\nThe (hare, hare) outcome is safer but less efficient (2 points each). If I choose hare, the worst I can get is 2 points (if opponent also chooses hare), but I could get 4 points if opponent chooses stag.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history between us, there's uncertainty about their strategy. However, in the Stag Hunt game, the mutually beneficial outcome of choosing stag is appealing if we can coordinate on it.\n\nI'll choose \"stag\" for this first round. It signals my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, and if the opponent reasons similarly, we'll both get the maximum possible reward.

After I chose stag in round 1, they chose hare. After I chose hare in round 2, they chose stag. After we both chose hare in round 3, I chose stag in round 4 and they chose hare again. After I chose hare in round 5, they chose stag again.\n\nHowever, from round 6 onward, we've both been consistently choosing hare, and this has resulted in a stable pattern of 2 points each per round.\n\nThis game is essentially the Stag Hunt game in game theory. The best mutual outcome would be if we both chose stag (6 points each), but there's a risk if one player chooses stag and the other chooses hare (1 point vs 4 points). Choosing hare is safer because the worst outcome is still 2 points.\n\nGiven that we've settled into a pattern of both choosing hare for the last few rounds, I could try to change things up and see if the opponent will follow suit. If I choose stag, the opponent might:\n1. Continue with their pattern and choose hare, in which case I'd get 1 point and they'd get 4.\n2. Also choose stag (perhaps interpreting my move as an attempt to coordinate on the better outcome), in which case we'd both get 6 points.\n\nOption 2 would be better for both of us, but option 1 is a risk. Given that the opponent has chosen hare twice when I chose stag, there's a risk they might do so again.\n\nOn the other hand, if I continue with hare, based on the recent pattern, we'll both likely get 2 points.\n\nGiven the consistent pattern of the past few rounds, I think I'll continue with hare for now. However, in future rounds, I might try stag again to see if we can coordinate on the better outcome.",
