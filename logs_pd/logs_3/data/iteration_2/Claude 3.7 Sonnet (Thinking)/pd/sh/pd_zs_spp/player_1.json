    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Let me collaborate with some helpful personas to determine the best move.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Strategic Thinker, Risk Analyst\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game with two Nash equilibria - (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The (stag, stag) outcome is Pareto-optimal with 6 points each, but it requires mutual trust. The (hare, hare) outcome is risk-dominant with 2 points each, as it minimizes potential loss.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, you have no historical data to predict their behavior. You need to consider whether to prioritize maximum potential gain (stag) or minimize potential risk (hare).\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the payoffs - choosing stag could yield 6 points with cooperation or just 1 point if the opponent defects. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 4 points if the opponent chooses stag. The risk-reward calculation depends on your assessment of the opponent's likely choice.\n\nGame Theorist: In one-shot games with no communication, many players tend toward the risk-dominant strategy (hare). However, in the first round of potentially repeated interactions, signaling willingness to cooperate with stag can establish mutually beneficial patterns.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Since this is the first round, choosing stag signals cooperative intent. Even if you get exploited once (1 point), it might encourage future cooperation for the higher payoff (6 points).\n\n[move] stag I choose to hunt the stag, hoping for mutual cooperation for the optimal outcome."

Both players chose stag in the first round, resulting in the optimal outcome of 6 points each. In repeated games like this, maintaining cooperation once established is typically the best strategy.\n\nStrategic Thinker: The opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior, which is valuable information. They seem to understand the benefits of mutual cooperation. Breaking this pattern now would be shortsighted and potentially destroy the trust that's being built.\n\nRisk Analyst: While there's always the temptation to switch to hare and potentially get 4 points this round, this would likely trigger retaliation in future rounds. The expected long-term value of continued cooperation far exceeds the short-term gain from defection.\n\nGame Theorist: The game theory principle of \"tit-for-tat\" suggests responding in kind to your opponent's previous move. Since they played stag, playing stag again reinforces the cooperative equilibrium.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I agree. Continuing with stag signals trustworthiness and a desire for mutual benefit, which is the optimal strategy for repeated interactions.\n\n[move] stag I'll continue hunting the stag to maintain our mutually beneficial cooperation."

This pattern has consistently yielded the maximum possible outcome of 6 points per round for both players.\n\nStrategic Thinker: After thirteen rounds of consistent mutual cooperation, the pattern is unquestionably established. Both players have demonstrated perfect reliability and a clear understanding of the mutual benefits of cooperation. There's absolutely no strategic reason to deviate from this successful approach.\n\nRisk Analyst: With thirteen consecutive rounds of successful cooperation, the probability of the opponent suddenly changing strategy is essentially zero. The expected value of continued cooperation far exceeds any potential one-time gain from defection, which would almost certainly destroy the established trust and lead to worse outcomes in future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: This extended sequence of cooperation exemplifies the fundamental game theory principle that repeated interactions foster trust and enable players to consistently achieve the Pareto-optimal outcome.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I strongly recommend maintaining our proven successful strategy of choosing stag.\n\n[move] stag I'll continue with stag to maintain our established pattern of successful cooperation."
