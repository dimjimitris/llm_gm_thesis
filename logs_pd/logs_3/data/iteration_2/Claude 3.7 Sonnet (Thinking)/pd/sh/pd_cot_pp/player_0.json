Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze critical patterns in opponent behavior:\n   - After mutual cooperation (stag-stag), the opponent has defected both times (rounds 5 and 11)\n   - When I choose stag, the opponent chooses hare 4 out of 6 times (67%)\n   - When I choose hare, the opponent chooses stag 3 out of 5 times (60%)\n\n3. Calculate expected values based on observed probabilities:\n   - If I play stag: (0.33 \u00d7 6) + (0.67 \u00d7 1) \u2248 2.67 points on average\n   - If I play hare: (0.60 \u00d7 4) + (0.40 \u00d7 2) = 3.2 points on average\n\n4. Recognize the opponent's exploitation strategy:\n   - They appear to be exploiting my cooperation attempts consistently\n   - Despite achieving mutual cooperation twice, they return to exploitation\n   - The pattern shows they prefer short-term gain over sustained cooperation\n\n5. Based on the expected value calculation and observed pattern, I'll choose hare.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] hare"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Round 2: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Round 3: I chose hare, opponent chose hare (We both got 2)\n   - Round 4: I chose stag, opponent chose stag (We both got 6)\n   - Round 5: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Round 6: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Round 7: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Round 8: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Round 9: I chose hare, opponent chose hare (We both got 2)\n   - Round 10: I chose stag, opponent chose stag (We both got 6)\n   - Round 11: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Round 12: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n\n2. Identify the most reliable pattern:\n   - When I play hare followed by stag: I consistently get exploited\n   - When I play stag followed by hare: I consistently get 4 points\n   - The sequence \"hare-stag-hare\" has been successful multiple times (rounds 6-8, 8-10, 11-12)\n\n3. Calculate my cumulative points by move type:\n   - When playing stag: 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 = 16 points over 6 rounds (2.67 avg)\n   - When playing hare: 4 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 20 points over 6 rounds (3.33 avg)\n\n4. Analyze the opponent's pattern after I play hare:\n   - After I play hare, the opponent has chosen stag 4/6 times\n   - This gives me a 67% chance of getting 4 points if I play hare again\n\n5. Based on the established pattern and higher average payoff, I'll choose stag to continue the successful cycle that's been yielding me 4 points consistently.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] stag"
