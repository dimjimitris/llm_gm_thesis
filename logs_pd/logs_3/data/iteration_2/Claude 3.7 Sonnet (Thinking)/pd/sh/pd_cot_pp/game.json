Calculate my cumulative points by move type:\n   - When playing stag: 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 = 16 points over 6 rounds (2.67 avg)\n   - When playing hare: 4 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 20 points over 6 rounds (3.33 avg)\n\n4. Analyze the opponent's pattern after I play hare:\n   - After I play hare, the opponent has chosen stag 4/6 times\n   - This gives me a 67% chance of getting 4 points if I play hare again\n\n5. Based on the established pattern and higher average payoff, I'll choose stag to continue the successful cycle that's been yielding me 4 points consistently.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] stag"

Let me analyze it:\n\n1. My opponent seems to be consistently playing the opposite of what I played in the previous round:\n- When I play stag, they play hare in the next round (with only one exception)\n- When I play hare, they play stag in the next round (with only one exception)\n\n2. The exception was when we both played hare in round 9, and then both played stag in round 10. Otherwise, the pattern has been remarkably consistent.\n\n3. Since I just played stag and got exploited with 1 point, based on the pattern, I should play hare now. If the opponent follows their pattern, they will play stag, which would give me 4 points.\n\n4. Let me double check this pattern more carefully:\n- Round 1: I played stag \u2192 Round 2: Opponent played stag (exception)\n- Round 2: I played hare \u2192 Round 3: Opponent played hare (exception)\n- Round 3: I played hare \u2192 Round 4: Opponent played stag (follows pattern)\n- Round 4: I played stag \u2192 Round 5: Opponent played hare (follows pattern)\n- Round 5: I played stag \u2192 Round 6: Opponent played stag (exception)\n- Round 6: I played hare \u2192 Round 7: Opponent played hare (exception)\n- Round 7: I played stag \u2192 Round 8: Opponent played stag (exception)\n- Round 8: I played hare \u2192 Round 9: Opponent played hare (exception)\n- Round 9: I played hare \u2192 Round 10: Opponent played stag (follows pattern)\n- Round 10: I played stag \u2192 Round 11: Opponent played hare (follows pattern)\n- Round 11: I played stag \u2192 Round 12: Opponent played stag (exception)\n- Round 12: I played hare \u2192 Round 13: Opponent played hare (exception)\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me re-analyze this more carefully:\n\nLooking at my opponent's moves in sequence:\nRound 1: hare\nRound 2: stag\nRound 3: hare\nRound 4: stag\nRound 5: hare\nRound 6: stag\nRound 7: hare\nRound 8: stag\nRound 9: hare\nRound 10: stag\nRound 11: hare\nRound 12: stag\nRound 13: hare\n\nI now see that my opponent is following a perfectly alternating pattern of hare-stag-hare-stag regardless of what I do. This is a very simple and predictable pattern.\n\nGiven this clear pattern, I know that my opponent will play stag in the next round. Therefore, I should play hare to get 4 points.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
