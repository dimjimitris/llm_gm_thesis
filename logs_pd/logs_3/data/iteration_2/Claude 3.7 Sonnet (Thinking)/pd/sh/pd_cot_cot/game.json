Consider risk vs. reward:\n   - Stag has highest potential reward but requires cooperation\n   - Hare is safer as it guarantees at least 2 points\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I'll assume they might be willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n4.

Expected value calculation:\n   - Expected value of choosing stag (given other's history): 6 points\n   - Expected value of choosing hare: 4 points once, then likely 2 points per round\n\nBased on this analysis, there is no rational reason to change my strategy. Continuing to choose stag is the optimal move as it:\n- Maximizes my points this round\n- Maintains our cooperative equilibrium\n- Preserves the highest expected value for future rounds\n\nTherefore, I will choose stag again for this round.",
