I scored only 1 point while my opponent likely got 6 points.\n\n2. For the next several rounds, I chose \"hare\" and the opponent also chose \"hare\", resulting in us both getting 2 points each time.\n\n3. In round 6, I tried \"stag\" again, but the opponent chose \"hare\" again, so I only got 1 point.\n\n4. Since then, I've been choosing \"hare\" and the opponent has been doing the same.\n\nThis appears to be a classic Stag Hunt game, where mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) would yield the highest collective outcome (4+4=8 points), but there's risk involved. If one player chooses stag and the other chooses hare, the stag hunter gets very little (1 point) while the hare hunter gets the most individually (6 points).\n\nMy opponent seems to be consistently choosing \"hare\" so far. They haven't tried \"stag\" even once from what I can observe.\n\nLet's consider my options:\n1. Continue choosing \"hare\": This guarantees me 2 points per round as long as my opponent also chooses \"hare\".\n2. Try \"stag\" again: This is risky - if my opponent continues with \"hare\", I'll only get 1 point. But if they ever decide to cooperate and choose \"stag\", we'd both get 4 points.\n\nGiven that my opponent has consistently chosen \"hare\" in all previous rounds, it seems unlikely they'll switch to \"stag\" now. The safer option is to continue with \"hare\" to ensure a consistent 2 points per round.\n\nHowever, there's also value in occasionally testing if the opponent might be willing to cooperate. The potential gain from mutual \"stag\" choices (4 points each) is significant compared to mutual \"hare\" choices (2 points each).\n\nFor this round, I'll go with \"hare\" again, as it seems to be the safer option given the opponent's pattern.",
