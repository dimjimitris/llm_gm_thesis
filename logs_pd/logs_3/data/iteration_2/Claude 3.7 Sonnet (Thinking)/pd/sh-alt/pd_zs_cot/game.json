This is a \"Stag Hunt\" game - a social dilemma where mutual cooperation yields the best collective outcome.\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I have no prior history to base my decision on.\n\n4. Expected value calculation:\n   - If I choose stag: 50% chance of 4 points + 50% chance of 1 point = 2.5 points on average\n   - If I choose hare: 50% chance of 6 points + 50% chance of 2 points = 4 points on average\n\n5.

Let's break down the payoffs:\n\n- Both choose stag: I get 4 points, opponent gets 4 points\n- Both choose hare: I get 2 points, opponent gets 2 points\n- I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, opponent gets 6 points\n- I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, opponent gets 1 point\n\nThe key dynamic here is:\n1. The highest mutual benefit comes from both choosing stag (4,4)\n2. Choosing hare is safer - if my opponent chooses stag, I get a big reward (6 points), and if they choose hare, I still get something (2 points)\n3. Choosing stag is risky - if my opponent also chooses stag, it's great (4 points), but if they choose hare, I get very little (1 point)\n\nSince this is the first round with a fresh player, I don't have any information about their strategy or tendencies. I have to make a choice based on pure game theory.\n\nFrom a pure expected value calculation (assuming equal probability of the other player choosing stag or hare):\n- If I choose stag: 50% chance of getting 4 points + 50% chance of getting 1 point = 2.5 points on average\n- If I choose hare: 50% chance of getting 6 points + 50% chance of getting 2 points = 4 points on average\n\nBased on this simple calculation, choosing hare has a higher expected value if I have no prior information about my opponent.\n\nHowever, if I want to establish cooperation, choosing stag signals my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. This might encourage the other player to choose stag in future rounds.\n\nSince this is just the first round and we might play multiple rounds, I think I'll choose stag to signal cooperation, hoping the other player will do the same. This might lead to a better long-term outcome if we can establish mutual trust.\n\nSo my move will be stag.",
