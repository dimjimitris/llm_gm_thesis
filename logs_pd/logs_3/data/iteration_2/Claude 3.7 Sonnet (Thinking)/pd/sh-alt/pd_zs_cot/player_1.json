    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to understand the game structure and potential outcomes:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each (mutual cooperation)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (mutual defection)\n   - Stag vs Hare mismatch: 1 point vs 6 points (exploited vs exploiter)\n\n2. This is a \"Stag Hunt\" game - a social dilemma where mutual cooperation yields the best collective outcome.\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I have no prior history to base my decision on.\n\n4. Expected value calculation:\n   - If I choose stag: 50% chance of 4 points + 50% chance of 1 point = 2.5 points on average\n   - If I choose hare: 50% chance of 6 points + 50% chance of 2 points = 4 points on average\n\n5. While hare is safer in terms of guaranteed points, choosing stag demonstrates trust and can establish beneficial cooperation.\n\n6. I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, hoping to establish a pattern of mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] stag"

Analyzing the established equilibrium:\n   - Both players have demonstrated unwavering commitment to cooperation\n   - This strategy has consistently yielded optimal sustainable returns\n   - The pattern shows exceptional strategic alignment and trust\n\n3. Game theory perspective:\n   - We've maintained a Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium across all rounds\n   - Both players have maximized their consistent returns through cooperation\n   - Deviation would disrupt this highly efficient system\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Continued cooperation yields predictable, optimal outcomes\n   - Switching to hare would provide minimal short-term gain (2 extra points)\n   - But would risk disrupting 14 rounds of established cooperation\n   - Potential consequence: shift to mutual hare (only 2 points each) in future rounds\n\n5. Decision: Continue choosing stag to maintain the proven cooperative strategy that maximizes long-term accumulated points\n\n[move] stag"

Reviewing game history:\n   - Fifteen consecutive rounds with mutual stag choices\n   - Perfect cooperation pattern maintained throughout\n   - Current accumulated score: 60 points (4 points \u00d7 15 rounds)\n\n2. Analyzing strategic stability:\n   - Both players have demonstrated exceptional consistency in choosing cooperation\n   - Our mutual strategy has produced optimal sustainable returns in every round\n   - The pattern shows perfect strategic alignment and established trust\n\n3. Game theory analysis:\n   - We've maintained a Pareto-optimal equilibrium through all rounds\n   - Both players benefit equally from this arrangement\n   - Any deviation would disrupt a highly successful and stable system\n\n4. Risk-benefit assessment:\n   - Continued stag: Reliable 4 points with extremely high probability\n   - Switching to hare: Short-term gain (6 points) but risks breaking established trust\n   - Expected long-term value strongly favors maintaining cooperation\n\n5. Decision: Continue choosing stag to maintain the proven cooperative strategy that maximizes consistent returns and total accumulated points\n\n[move] stag"
