    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: \n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each (good cooperative outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (mediocre outcome)\n   - If I choose stag but opponent chooses hare: I get only 1 point, they get 6 (worst for me)\n   - If I choose hare but opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 (best for me)\n\n2. Consider the risk vs. reward:\n   - Stag offers better mutual benefit but is risky if the opponent doesn't cooperate\n   - Hare is safer as the minimum payoff is 2 instead of 1\n   - Hare also offers the highest possible individual payoff (6)\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a new player, I have no information about their strategy or tendencies\n\n4.

Identify emerging patterns:\n   - My opponent occasionally chooses stag after several rounds of mutual hare (happened in rounds 7 and 12)\n   - Last time this happened (round 7), I tried cooperating with stag in round 8 and got exploited\n   - Every time I've chosen stag (3 attempts), my opponent has chosen hare\n\n3. Consider my strategic options:\n   - Choose stag to attempt cooperation: High risk given historical exploitation\n   - Choose hare: Guarantees at least 2 points, with chance for 6 if they choose stag again\n\n4.
