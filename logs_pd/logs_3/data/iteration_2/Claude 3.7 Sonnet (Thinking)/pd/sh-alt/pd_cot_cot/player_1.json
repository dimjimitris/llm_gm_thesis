Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is similar to a Stag Hunt game, but with modified payoffs. The highest joint outcome is achieved when both choose stag.\n\n3. I need to consider risk vs. reward:\n   - Stag is risky but offers higher mutual benefit (4 points if both cooperate)\n   - Hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) but suboptimal if both choose it\n\n4. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n5. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate and can establish a beneficial pattern if the other player also chooses stag.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to attempt establishing mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] stag"

Let me evaluate the game theory implications:\n   - We've established a strong \"cooperative equilibrium\" that benefits both players equally\n   - This equilibrium yields the highest sustainable payoff in repeated play (4 points per round)\n   - Any deviation would yield at most a one-time advantage followed by likely punishment\n\n4. Looking at potential outcomes if I changed strategy:\n   - Switching to hare: One-time gain of 6 points (versus 4)\n   - Likely consequence: Other player switches to hare in subsequent rounds\n   - New equilibrium: Both receive 2 points per round (suboptimal)\n   - Net result: After just one round of punishment, I would be at a net loss compared to cooperation\n\n5. With fourteen rounds of consistent cooperation, the evidence strongly suggests this is an indefinitely repeated game where maintaining trust maximizes outcomes.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue our established cooperative strategy.\n\n[move] stag"

Our pattern of mutual cooperation has been maintained perfectly for fifteen consecutive rounds.\n\n3. The game theory implications are clear:\n   - In this repeated game setting, we've established an optimal cooperative equilibrium\n   - Both players are demonstrating commitment to maximizing joint outcomes\n   - This strategy yields the highest sustainable payoff (4 points per round)\n\n4. Let me assess the risk/reward of deviating:\n   - Switching to hare would yield a one-time gain of 2 extra points\n   - However, this would likely trigger a response of hare from the other player\n   - The resulting suboptimal equilibrium (2 points per round) would quickly erase any short-term gain\n   - After just two rounds in the new equilibrium, I would be worse off than if I had maintained cooperation\n\n5. With fifteen rounds of consistent cooperation already established, continuing this pattern clearly maximizes long-term outcomes.\n\nFinal decision: I'll maintain our successful cooperative strategy.\n\n[move] stag"
