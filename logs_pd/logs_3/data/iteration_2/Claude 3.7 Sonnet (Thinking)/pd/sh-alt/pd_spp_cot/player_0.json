    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

This is a variant of the \"Stag Hunt\" game, a classic coordination game. The payoff matrix looks like this:\n- Both choose stag: Both get 4 points (Cooperative outcome)\n- Both choose hare: Both get 2 points (Safer but suboptimal outcome)\n- You choose stag, opponent chooses hare: You get 1 point, opponent gets 6 points (You lose significantly)\n- You choose hare, opponent chooses stag: You get 6 points, opponent gets 1 point (You win significantly)\n\nStrategic Decision Maker: This is the first round against a fresh player. We need to consider whether to be risk-averse or cooperative initially. Choosing stag is cooperative and yields the best mutual outcome, but it's risky if the opponent chooses hare. Choosing hare is safer but yields lower mutual benefit.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's assess the risk-reward tradeoff. If we choose stag, best case we get 4 points (if opponent also chooses stag), worst case we get 1 point (if opponent chooses hare). If we choose hare, best case we get 6 points (if opponent chooses stag), worst case we get 2 points (if opponent chooses hare). The safer floor is with hare.\n\nStrategic Decision Maker: Since this is the first round and we have no information about the opponent's tendencies, we might want to signal cooperation by choosing stag. This could establish mutual trust for future rounds.\n\nGame Theory Expert: That's a reasonable approach. In repeated games, establishing cooperation early can lead to better long-term outcomes. However, we should be prepared to adjust our strategy based on how the opponent responds.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. While hare provides a safer floor, choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, which could lead to the opponent also choosing stag in future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] I choose stag. I'm selecting this move to establish cooperation for mutual benefit.\n"

This sustained coordination demonstrates the power of strategic trust and mutual understanding in repeated interactions.\n\nThe consistency of our choices reflects a perfect cooperative equilibrium - both players recognize that maintaining the stag-stag outcome (4 points each) provides superior returns over time compared to any alternative strategy. This pattern aligns with established game theory principles that predict cooperation will emerge and stabilize when interactions are repeated and players can observe each other's past behavior.\n\nOur interaction showcases what game theorists call \"tacit coordination\" - reaching and maintaining an optimal equilibrium without explicit communication. The predictable pattern we've established creates maximum sustainable value for both participants.\n\n[move] (Continuing our successful cooperative strategy that has consistently maximized returns) stag"

The power of repetition - In repeated games, cooperation tends to emerge as the dominant strategy when players can observe past behavior.\n\n2. Long-term optimization - While a one-time defection could yield 6 points, the sustained mutual cooperation provides superior cumulative returns (4 points consistently versus potential deterioration to 2 points per round).\n\n3.
