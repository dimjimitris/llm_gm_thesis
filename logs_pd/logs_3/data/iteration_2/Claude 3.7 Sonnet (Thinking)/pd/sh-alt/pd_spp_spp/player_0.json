    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a variant of the classic Stag Hunt game in game theory. The payoffs are:\n- Both stag: 4 points each (cooperative outcome)\n- Both hare: 2 points each (safe outcome)\n- Stag vs Hare: 1 point for stag chooser, 6 points for hare chooser (exploitation)\n\nThe key strategic consideration is risk vs. reward. Stag has higher mutual benefit but requires trust.\n\nStrategic Thinker: In the first round against a fresh player, we have no history to base our decision on. We need to consider both the immediate payoff and what signal we want to send for potential future rounds. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nPsychology Expert: New players often either play conservatively (hare) to avoid the worst outcome or optimistically (stag) hoping for cooperation. Since this is the first round, choosing stag could establish a cooperative norm if they're also cooperation-minded.\n\nGame Theorist: The stag choice is Pareto optimal - if we can coordinate on it, it's better for both players than the hare-hare outcome. However, it does carry risk.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I recommend choosing stag for the first move. It signals cooperative intent and offers the potential for the best sustainable outcome if the other player reciprocates.\n\n[move] stag - I choose cooperation hoping for mutual benefit in this opening round."

Both players chose stag in the first round, resulting in the optimal cooperative outcome of 4 points each. This suggests the other player is willing to cooperate.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Now that we've established mutual cooperation, the logical move is to continue with stag. In repeated games, maintaining the cooperative equilibrium typically yields the highest long-term payoff.\n\nPsychology Expert: The first round success creates positive expectations. Players typically continue successful strategies, especially when they've experienced the benefit of mutual cooperation. The other player will likely expect us to continue with stag.\n\nGame Theorist: Deviating to hare would give a one-time gain of 6 points (if they continue with stag), but would damage the cooperative relationship we've established. This could lead to both players choosing hare in future rounds (only 2 points each).\n\nStrategic Thinker: The most rational strategy here is to continue signaling cooperative intent by choosing stag again. This reinforces the pattern of mutual benefit and builds trust.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The other player likely expects consistency after a successful first round. Breaking that expectation could trigger defensive play in subsequent rounds.\n\n[move] stag - Continuing with cooperation after our successful first round."

With two successful cooperative rounds, there's strong evidence that the other player understands and values this cooperative strategy. Maintaining our stag choice is the rational move.\n\nPsychology Expert: Two rounds of mutual cooperation creates a strong social contract between players. At this point, the expectation of continued cooperation is quite high. Breaking this pattern could be interpreted as betrayal and might trigger retaliatory behavior in future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated game theory, the most successful long-term strategies typically involve maintaining cooperation until given reason to do otherwise. There's no indication that the other player plans to deviate.\n\nStrategic Thinker: While there's always the temptation to choose hare for a one-time gain of 6 points, this would likely damage the established relationship and reduce future payoffs. The expected value of continued cooperation exceeds the short-term gain from defection.\n\nPsychology Expert: Trust has been built over these two rounds.

Three rounds of consistent stag choices demonstrates their commitment to the mutual benefit strategy. The expected value of continuing with stag remains higher than attempting exploitation with hare.\n\nPsychology Expert: At this point, there's a strong psychological contract between the players. Three rounds create a very established pattern, and breaking this pattern would likely be perceived as an unexpected betrayal. The other player likely trusts that we'll continue choosing stag.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, the optimal strategy is typically to continue cooperation when it's being reciprocated.
