    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let's analyze the payoff matrix: both cooperate (4,4), both defect (2,2), one cooperates while other defects (1,6 or 6,1). In a one-shot game, defection is the Nash equilibrium, but in repeated games, cooperation can emerge as optimal.\n\nPsychologist: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their tendencies. Starting with cooperation signals willingness to establish mutual trust and can set a positive tone for future interactions.\n\nRisk Analyst: Cooperation carries more risk initially - if we cooperate and they defect, we get only 1 point while they get 6. However, if we can establish mutual cooperation, we get 4 points per round instead of the 2 points from mutual defection.\n\nStrategic Planner: A common successful strategy in this game is \"Tit for Tat\" - start with cooperation, then mirror what the opponent did in the previous round. This rewards cooperation and punishes defection while being clear and understandable.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with starting with cooperation. If they defect, we can switch to defection in the next round to signal we won't be repeatedly exploited.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Cooperate\n"

This remarkably consistent pattern demonstrates an exceptionally stable and beneficial relationship that has maximized our earnings throughout the game.\n\nThe game theory analysis continues to strongly support cooperation. Each round of mutual cooperation yields 4 points per player - twice what we would receive from mutual defection. While defecting could provide a one-time gain of 6 points, this short-term advantage would almost certainly disrupt our established pattern and lead to mutual defection in future rounds, substantially reducing our overall earnings.\n\nWith such a long history of successful cooperation and the clear mathematical benefit it provides, maintaining our current strategy remains the most rational choice for maximizing total points.\n\n[move] (Continuing our proven strategy of mutual cooperation for maximum sustained benefit) cooperation"
