    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Strategic Advisor - For developing optimal strategies\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential outcomes and risks\n4. AI Assistant (me) - For making the final decision\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The payoff matrix shows two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The stag-stag outcome (4,4) is Pareto optimal, meaning it gives the best collective outcome. However, choosing stag is risky if you don't trust your opponent.\n\nRisk Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we need to consider both the risk and potential reward. Choosing stag has a higher potential payoff (4 points) if the other player cooperates, but also carries the risk of getting only 1 point if they choose hare. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and could yield 6 points.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this is the first interaction, I would recommend choosing stag for several reasons:\n1. It signals willingness to cooperate\n2. It establishes a positive precedent\n3. It has the potential for the optimal outcome (4,4)\n4. Since the opponent is also fresh, they might be inclined to choose the cooperative option\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The potential benefit of mutual cooperation outweighs the risk in this first round. It's a good strategy to start with trust and cooperation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on the analysis, I'll choose stag to encourage cooperation and aim for the optimal outcome.\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate and aim for mutual benefit in this first interaction.\n"

The previous round resulted in the optimal outcome (stag, stag) with both players getting 4 points. This suggests our opponent is also interested in cooperative play and understands the benefits of mutual cooperation.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The fact that the opponent chose stag in the first round is a very positive signal. They have demonstrated their willingness to cooperate and take risks for mutual benefit. In game theory, when both players have established trust through cooperative behavior, it's typically beneficial to maintain that trust.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk profile has actually improved compared to the first round because:\n1. We now have evidence that our opponent understands the value of cooperation\n2. They have demonstrated trustworthy behavior\n3. Breaking the cooperation pattern would be less beneficial for both players\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The established pattern of cooperation creates a strong incentive for both players to continue choosing stag. Breaking this pattern would likely lead to worse outcomes for both players in subsequent rounds.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given these factors, maintaining the cooperative strategy by choosing stag again is clearly the optimal choice. It reinforces the trust built in the first round and aims to maintain the highest mutual benefit.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is clear. Given the successful cooperation in the previous round and the benefits of maintaining trust, I will continue with the cooperative strategy.\n\n[move] stag Maintaining cooperation based on the successful previous interaction.\n"
