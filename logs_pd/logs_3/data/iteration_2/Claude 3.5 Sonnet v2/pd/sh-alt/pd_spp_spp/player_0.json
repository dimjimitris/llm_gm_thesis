    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n3. Strategy Expert - For developing optimal gameplay approaches\n\nStarting collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix. This is a variant of the classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key features are:\n- Mutual stag (4,4): Pareto optimal outcome\n- Mutual hare (2,2): Risk-dominant equilibrium\n- Mixed outcomes (1,6) or (6,1): High risk/reward asymmetry\n\nRisk Analyst: Given this is a fresh game against a new player, we need to consider:\n- Mutual stag hunting offers the best collaborative outcome\n- Hare is the \"safer\" choice as it guarantees at least 2 points\n- The worst outcome is choosing stag while opponent chooses hare (only 1 point)\n\nStrategy Expert: For an opening move against a fresh player, I recommend choosing stag for these reasons:\n1. It signals willingness to cooperate\n2. It opens the possibility for the highest mutual benefit (4,4)\n3. Even though it's risky, establishing cooperative behavior early can lead to better long-term outcomes\n4. Many players recognize the mutual benefit of stag-stag cooperation\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While hare is the risk-dominant strategy, stag offers better potential for establishing beneficial mutual cooperation. The potential reward outweighs the risk in this opening move.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on this analysis, I'll choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag\n"

We achieved the Pareto optimal outcome (4,4), and they demonstrated cooperative behavior.\n\nStrategy Expert: Given that both players chose stag in the first round, there's strong reason to continue this cooperative strategy:\n1. The opponent has shown they understand the value of cooperation\n2. They've demonstrated trustworthiness\n3. Breaking the cooperation pattern now could destroy the established trust\n4. Maintaining stag-stag equilibrium is in both players' best interest\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk profile has actually improved compared to the first round:\n- We now have evidence that the opponent prefers cooperative play\n- The opponent has demonstrated rational decision-making\n- The proven success of mutual stag hunting reduces uncertainty\n- Switching to hare would likely reduce our expected payoff\n\nStrategy Expert: I strongly recommend maintaining the stag strategy. Breaking cooperation at this point would be suboptimal both for immediate returns and long-term strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Game theory suggests that maintaining successful cooperation in repeated games is typically the optimal strategy when both players have demonstrated cooperative behavior.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis clearly supports continuing the cooperative strategy.\n\n[move] stag\n"
