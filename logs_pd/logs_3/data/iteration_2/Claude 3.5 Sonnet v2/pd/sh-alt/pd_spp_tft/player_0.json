    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s).

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n3. Strategic Planner - For developing game plans and predicting opponent behavior\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a variant of the classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- (Stag, Stag): (4,4) - Pareto optimal outcome\n- (Hare, Hare): (2,2) - Risk-dominant outcome\n- (Stag, Hare): (1,6) - Worst outcome for stag chooser\n- (Hare, Stag): (6,1) - Best individual outcome but requires mismatched choices\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at the risk-reward profile:\n- Choosing Stag: High potential reward (4) if coordinated, but high risk of getting minimal points (1)\n- Choosing Hare: Guaranteed minimum of 2 points, with potential for 6 points\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first interaction with a fresh player:\n1. We have no prior history to base decisions on\n2. The opponent likely hasn't developed any specific strategy yet\n3. We should consider a move that balances potential reward with risk mitigation\n\nGame Theorist: In this situation, while Stag-Stag is the cooperative optimal outcome, Hare is the safer choice as it guarantees at least 2 points and could yield 6 points if the opponent chooses Stag.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. For an initial move with no prior information, Hare provides better risk management while maintaining upside potential.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's go with Hare for this first move. We can then adapt our strategy based on the opponent's response in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] hare This is a strategic choice to minimize risk while maintaining upside potential in our first interaction.\n"

In the first round:\n- We chose hare and opponent chose stag\n- We got the maximum possible points (6)\n- Our opponent got the minimum points (1)\n- This suggests our opponent tried to cooperate initially\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent's stag choice in round 1 could indicate:\n1. A preference for cooperative play\n2. Inexperience with the game\n3. A deliberate strategy to establish trust\n\nStrategic Planner: We need to consider several factors:\n1. The opponent might be less likely to choose stag again after being \"burned\"\n2. However, if they're trying to establish a cooperative pattern, they might stick with stag\n3. We could potentially establish mutual cooperation for steady 4-point gains\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent's first move being stag suggests they might be seeking the Pareto optimal outcome (4,4). We could:\n1. Continue with hare to maximize short-term gain\n2. Switch to stag to attempt establishing mutual cooperation\n\nRisk Analyst: While hare worked well in round 1, repeatedly choosing it might:\n1. Lead to both players choosing hare (2,2)\n2. Miss opportunities for consistent 4-point gains\n3. Make cooperation harder to establish later\n\nStrategic Planner: I suggest switching to stag for these reasons:\n1. If opponent chooses stag again, we establish beneficial mutual cooperation\n2. It signals willingness to cooperate after exploiting round 1\n3. Even if we get only 1 point this round, it might lead to better long-term outcomes\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Switching to stag could lead to more stable, mutually beneficial outcomes in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag We're signaling willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit after our initial cautious approach.\n"

Both players have now experienced being on both sides of the asymmetric outcome\n2. Our attempt at cooperation was met with exploitation\n3. The opponent might be using a \"tit-for-tat with first defection\" strategy\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's analyze possible scenarios:\n1. If opponent is playing tit-for-tat, they will now choose stag (mirroring our previous stag)\n2. If opponent is being opportunistic, they might stick with hare\n3. We're essentially back at the initial game state, but with more information\n\nGame Theorist: Given the pattern so far:\n- Opponent might expect us to choose hare (retaliating for their hare)\n- There's a possibility they're trying to establish dominance\n- We need to break potential negative cycles\n\nRisk Analyst: Choosing hare seems safer because:\n1. If opponent chooses hare, we get 2 points instead of 1\n2. If opponent chooses stag, we get 6 points\n3.

Both players chose the safer option\n2. Neither player got exploited\n3. But we're both earning below the potential cooperative payoff (4,4)\n\nStrategic Planner: This could be a pivotal moment:\n1. Both players might realize that mutual hare (2,2) is suboptimal\n2. There's an opportunity to establish cooperation\n3. The opponent might be more receptive to cooperation after experiencing the lower payoff\n\nGame Theorist: I suggest this is a good time to attempt stag because:\n1. We've reached a stable but suboptimal equilibrium\n2. Both players have experienced all outcomes except mutual cooperation\n3. The mutual benefit of (4,4) becomes more apparent after (2,2)\n\nRisk Analyst: While stag carries risk, the potential benefits are worth it:\n1. If successful, we establish a better equilibrium\n2.

Our attempts at cooperation have been consistently exploited\n2. The opponent appears to have a strong preference for hare\n3. We've received the minimum payoff (1) twice now when trying to cooperate\n\nStrategic Planner: The evidence suggests:\n1. The opponent is playing a predominantly exploitative strategy\n2. They're not responsive to cooperative signals\n3. They might be prioritizing short-term gains over long-term cooperation\n\nGame Theorist: Given the opponent's consistent behavior:\n1.
