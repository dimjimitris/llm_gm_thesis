Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Consider the strategy for first move:\n   * This is a fresh player, with no history\n   * The highest mutual benefit comes from both choosing stag (4 points each)\n   * However, there's risk if other player chooses hare (I'd get only 1 point)\n\n3. Evaluate game theory principles:\n   * This is similar to a \"stag hunt\" dilemma\n   * Cooperation (stag) could establish trust and lead to better long-term outcomes\n   * First move can set the tone for future interactions\n\n4. Make a decision:\n   * Since it's the first move, I'll choose stag to:\n     - Signal willingness to cooperate\n     - Aim for optimal mutual outcome\n     - Establish positive precedent\n   * While this has some risk, the potential reward is worth it\n\n[move] stag\n"

Pattern recognition:\n   * Every time we achieve mutual stag\n   * Opponent follows with hare in the next round\n   * This has happened both times we reached cooperation\n   * It appears to be a deliberate strategy, not random\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   * Continuing stag is foolish given opponent's consistent betrayal\n   * Need to protect against exploitation\n   * Hare gives better minimum outcome (2 vs 1)\n   * Opponent needs to learn that breaking trust has consequences\n\n5. Make a decision:\n   * Switch to hare because:\n     - Cannot trust opponent to maintain cooperation\n     - Need to avoid being repeatedly exploited\n     - Protect against worst outcome\n     - Signal that breaking cooperation will be punished\n     - Opponent's behavior pattern is now clear and predictable\n\n[move] hare\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   * Strong cyclical pattern has emerged:\n     - When one player chooses stag, other chooses hare\n     - Mutual stag cooperation breaks down immediately\n     - Both players take turns exploiting each other\n     - No sustained cooperation has been achieved\n\n3.
