Since I'm playing against a fresh player, and this is a coordination game similar to the Stag Hunt:\n\n- Choosing \"stag\" has the highest mutual benefit (4 points each) if we both cooperate\n- Choosing \"hare\" is safer but gives lower rewards (2 points each)\n- There's risk in choosing stag if the other player chooses hare (getting only 1 point)\n\nIn the first round, I think it's worth trying to establish cooperation for mutual benefit. While there's some risk, the potential reward of 4 points from mutual stag hunting is attractive.\n\n[move] stag I choose to hunt stag, aiming for mutual cooperation and higher rewards.\n"
