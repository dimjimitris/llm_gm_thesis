    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Risk Analyst - Specializes in evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n3. Behavioral Psychologist - Understanding player psychology and decision patterns\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic stag hunt game, which is a coordination game. The Nash equilibrium suggests two pure strategy equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The stag-stag outcome is Pareto optimal, giving both players the highest mutual benefit (4,4).\n\nRisk Analyst: True, but we need to consider the risk-reward profile. Choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, we only get 1 point while they get 6. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 6 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first interaction with a fresh player, they may be inclined to play conservatively. However, establishing cooperative behavior early can lead to better outcomes. Players often reciprocate initial cooperative gestures.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While (hare, hare) is the risk-dominant equilibrium, choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. Against a fresh player, this could set a positive precedent.\n\nRisk Analyst: The potential downside of choosing stag (1 point) is outweighed by the potential upside (4 points) and the strategic value of signaling cooperation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Yes, and first impressions matter. Starting with stag shows trust and encourages reciprocity.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, aiming to establish a pattern of collaborative play that could lead to optimal outcomes for both players.\n"

The other player demonstrated willingness to cooperate.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is a very positive sign. The other player choosing stag in the first round suggests they understand the value of cooperation. Players who have experienced successful cooperation tend to stick with that strategy unless given a reason to deviate.\n\nRisk Analyst: The fact that they chose stag in the first round significantly reduces our risk assessment for choosing stag again. They've demonstrated both understanding of the game and willingness to cooperate.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Game theory suggests that when players successfully coordinate on the Pareto optimal outcome, they tend to maintain that strategy in repeated games unless there's a disruption.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological momentum is in favor of continued cooperation. Breaking this trust now would be counterproductive for long-term gains.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk-reward profile still favors stag here. We've established mutual trust, and maintaining it is likely to yield the best consistent returns.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Maintaining the cooperative strategy after successful mutual cooperation in the previous round.

There's no strategic reason to deviate from a working strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Deviating now could break the trust we've built and potentially trigger a retaliatory response in future rounds, leading to less optimal outcomes.\n\nRisk Analyst: The consistent behavior of our opponent reduces uncertainty.

This type of consistent behavior typically indicates a sophisticated player who understands long-term strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: The Nash equilibrium we've achieved is proving to be very stable.
