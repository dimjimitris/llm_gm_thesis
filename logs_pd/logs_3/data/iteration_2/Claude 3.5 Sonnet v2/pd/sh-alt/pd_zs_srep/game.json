Since I'm playing against a fresh player, and there's no prior history to base decisions on, I believe starting with cooperative behavior might be beneficial to establish mutual trust.\n\nThe stag choice offers the potential for the best outcome (4 points) if the other player also cooperates, though it carries the risk of getting only 1 point if they choose hare. While hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 2 points), it limits the potential for mutual benefit.\n\nI'll choose stag as an opening move to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag\n"
