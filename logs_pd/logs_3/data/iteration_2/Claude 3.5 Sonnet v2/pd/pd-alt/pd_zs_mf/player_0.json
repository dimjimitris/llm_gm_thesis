Since this is the first move against a new player, I'll approach it by considering the payoff matrix carefully.\n\nCooperating offers the potential for mutual benefit (6 points each) while carrying some risk (1 point if exploited). Defecting provides a safer minimum (2 points) and opportunity for higher gain (4 points) if the other player cooperates, but could lead to mutual loss if both defect.\n\nGiven this is the first interaction, I'll choose cooperation as a friendly opening move. This signals willingness to work together for mutual benefit, and research has shown that starting with cooperation can often lead to better long-term outcomes in repeated games.\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to start with cooperation to establish a potential pattern of mutual benefit.\n"
