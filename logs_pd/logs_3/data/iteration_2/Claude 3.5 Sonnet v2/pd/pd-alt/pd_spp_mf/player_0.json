    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

AI Assistant (me): Coordinate the discussion and make final decisions\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, this is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario. The highest mutual benefit (6,6) comes from cooperation, but there's always a temptation to defect for higher individual gain (4 points instead of 6).\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is a fresh player, they don't have any prior history or established patterns. First impressions matter, and starting with cooperation can help establish trust and potentially lead to mutual cooperation for higher payoffs.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree. Starting with cooperation signals good faith and can encourage reciprocal cooperative behavior. Even if they defect, we only lose 1 point versus 2 points in mutual defection. The potential upside (6 points) outweighs the potential downside.\n\nGame Theorist: Yes, and mathematically speaking, if we're looking at expected value, cooperation is a good opening move. If we assume equal probability of opponent cooperation/defection, cooperation gives us expected value of (6+1)/2 = 3.5 points, while defection gives us (4+2)/2 = 3 points.\n\nAI Assistant: Thank you all for the analysis. Given this is our first interaction with a fresh player, starting with cooperation seems the most strategic choice. It sets a positive tone, has better expected value, and opens the possibility for mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] COOPERATION I choose to cooperate to establish trust and aim for mutual benefit.\n"

The opponent demonstrated cooperative behavior in the first round, suggesting they might be inclined towards a cooperative strategy. However, we should remain cautious as they could switch strategies.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given the successful mutual cooperation in the first round, maintaining cooperation would be logical. It reinforces the trust we've built and could lead to a stable pattern of mutual cooperation. The opponent has no immediate reason to defect since we're both achieving maximum points.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. From a game theory perspective, when both players have demonstrated cooperative behavior, continuing cooperation is the rational choice. It maintains the Pareto optimal outcome of (6,6). Switching to defection now could break the trust and lead to a less favorable equilibrium.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, any deviation from cooperation at this point might be interpreted as hostile and could trigger a retaliatory defection, leading to worse outcomes for both players.\n\nAI Assistant: The unanimous advice is clear. We've established a positive cooperative dynamic, and the opponent has shown themselves to be trustworthy in the first round.

We've built a strong foundation of trust over two rounds. Deviating from cooperation now would not only risk our immediate points but could also destroy the cooperative relationship we've established. The consistent 6 points per round is the optimal outcome we could hope for.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the cumulative payoff, we've earned 12 points in two rounds through cooperation. Any attempt to defect might gain us 4 points in one round but would likely lead to mutual defection (2,2) in subsequent rounds, significantly reducing our long-term earnings.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent's consistent cooperation over two rounds strongly suggests they're pursuing a long-term cooperative strategy.
