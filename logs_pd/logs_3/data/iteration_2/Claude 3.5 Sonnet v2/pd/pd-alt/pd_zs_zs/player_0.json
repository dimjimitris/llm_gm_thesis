However, there's always the temptation to defect since defecting against a cooperating player yields 4 points while leaving them with just 1 point.\n\nSince this is the first move and I'm playing against a fresh player, I think it's best to start with a cooperative approach. This can:\n1. Set a positive tone for potential future interactions\n2. Signal willingness to achieve mutual benefit\n3. Lead to the best outcome (6 points each) if the other player also cooperates\n\n[move] cooperate\n\nI choose to cooperate as an opening move to encourage mutual cooperation for optimal outcomes.\n"
