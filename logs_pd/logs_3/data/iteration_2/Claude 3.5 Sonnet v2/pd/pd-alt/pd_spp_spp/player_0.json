    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix. We have a classic prisoner's dilemma structure:\n- Mutual cooperation (6,6) yields the highest combined payoff\n- Mutual defection (2,2) is the Nash equilibrium\n- Unilateral defection (4,1) gives temporary advantage but might lead to retaliation\n- Being defected against while cooperating (1,4) is the worst outcome\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, establishing a cooperative tone early could lead to mutual trust and higher payoffs. However, we should be prepared for the possibility of defection.\n\nStrategic Advisor: In repeated games, starting with cooperation often signals willingness to achieve mutual benefit. It's a good way to establish trust, and if the other player defects, we can adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\nRisk Analyst: While cooperation carries the risk of getting only 1 point if the opponent defects, it also opens the possibility for the highest sustainable payoff (6 points) through mutual cooperation. The potential reward outweighs the risk in this first move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Starting with cooperation gives us the best chance to establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, which would maximize our long-term points.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's choose cooperation for this first move, but remain alert to the other player's response to inform our future moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Cooperate\n"

The pattern is now deeply embedded in the game's dynamic.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Our strategy has maintained perfect effectiveness through thirteen iterations. With such a long history of maximum payoffs, any deviation would not only be suboptimal but would disrupt what has become an exemplary demonstration of successful cooperative gameplay.\n\nRisk Analyst: Thirteen consecutive rounds of proven 6-point outcomes make the risk-reward analysis crystal clear. The demonstrated reliability of our cooperative strategy continues to be the most secure path to maximum points.\n\nGame Theorist: The mathematical case for maintaining cooperation grows even stronger with each successful round. We're experiencing the ideal equilibrium state that game theory predicts for rational players.\n\n[move] (Maintaining our perfect cooperative strategy which has consistently maximized returns for thirteen rounds) cooperation\n"

The consistent achievement of maximum possible points makes any deviation increasingly irrational. We've established and maintained the most efficient possible equilibrium.\n\nRisk Analyst: With fourteen rounds of proven cooperation yielding optimal outcomes, the risk assessment strongly favors maintaining our current strategy. The demonstrated reliability of achieving 6 points per round through cooperation continues to be our best path forward.\n\nGame Theorist: From a game theory perspective, when a strategy achieves and maintains optimal outcomes this consistently over such an extended period, continuing that strategy remains the clear rational choice.\n\n[move] (Continuing our highly effective cooperative strategy which has yielded maximum points for fourteen straight rounds) cooperation\n"
