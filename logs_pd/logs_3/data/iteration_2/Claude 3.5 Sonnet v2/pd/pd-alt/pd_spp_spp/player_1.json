    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert: Understanding human behavior and cooperation dynamics\n3. Strategic Advisor: Helps formulate optimal strategies based on game conditions\n4. Decision Analyst: Evaluates risk-reward scenarios\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. We have:\n- Mutual cooperation: 6,6\n- Mutual defection: 2,2\n- One defects, one cooperates: 4,1 (in favor of defector)\nThe Nash equilibrium in a single-shot game would be mutual defection, but if this is repeated, cooperation might be beneficial.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is a fresh player, they don't have any prior history or established patterns. Initial interactions often set the tone for future exchanges. Starting with cooperation can signal good faith and potentially establish mutual trust.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree. While defection might seem tempting for short-term gain (4 vs 6 points), it could lead to a cycle of mutual defection (2 points each) if the other player retaliates. Cooperation offers the highest mutual benefit.\n\nDecision Analyst: The risk of cooperating is getting only 1 point if the other player defects, while the potential reward is 6 points with mutual cooperation. Given this is a fresh start, cooperation aligns with both optimal outcomes and trust-building.\n\nGame Theorist: For the first move, cooperation indeed seems optimal. It allows for the highest mutual payoff while establishing a cooperative precedent.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the consensus. Starting with cooperation signals good faith and opens the possibility for sustained mutual benefit. Even if the other player defects, we'll have learned something valuable about their strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate as an opening move to signal willingness for mutual benefit.\n"

Players who start with cooperation often continue this pattern unless given reason to distrust. Breaking this trust now could disrupt the beneficial pattern.\n\nStrategic Advisor: With both players demonstrating willingness to cooperate, maintaining this strategy seems optimal. The established mutual trust could lead to sustained high scores of 6 points per round.\n\nDecision Analyst: The risk-reward scenario favors continuing cooperation. We've established a beneficial pattern that's yielding maximum points.
