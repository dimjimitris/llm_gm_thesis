These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

If moves differ, one gets 4 and one gets 1 point (uneven outcome)\n\nIn this case, I'll choose to cooperate for a few reasons:\n- It signals good faith and encourages mutual cooperation\n- It offers the potential for the highest mutual payoff (6 points each)\n- Even if the other player defects, the loss isn't catastrophic\n\n[move] cooperate\n"
