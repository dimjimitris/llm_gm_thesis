Choosing \"hare\" is safer as it guarantees at least 2 points, and could yield 4 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\nSince this is the first move against a fresh player, I think it's worth trying to establish cooperation. While it's risky, the potential mutual benefit of both choosing stag is significant. If we can establish this cooperative pattern early, it could lead to better outcomes for both players.\n\n[move] stag I choose to take the cooperative approach for our first interaction, hoping to establish mutual trust.\n"
