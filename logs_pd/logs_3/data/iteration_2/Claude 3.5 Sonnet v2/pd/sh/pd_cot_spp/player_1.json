    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential outcomes and risks\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This appears to be a variation of the classic \"Stag Hunt\" game in game theory. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Stag-Stag: (6,6) - Best mutual outcome\n- Hare-Hare: (2,2) - Safe but suboptimal\n- Stag-Hare: (1,4) - Worst outcome for stag chooser\n- Hare-Stag: (4,1) - Best individual outcome if other chooses stag\n\nStrategic Advisor: Against a fresh player, we need to consider their likely approach. Many players tend to play conservatively in their first move. However, establishing cooperation early could lead to better long-term outcomes.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate the risks:\n- Choosing stag: High risk (could get 1 point), high reward (could get 6 points)\n- Choosing hare: Moderate risk (guaranteed minimum 2 points), decent reward (could get 4 points)\nGiven this is the first move with a new player, we should consider setting a cooperative tone.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While hare is the \"risk-minimizing\" choice, choosing stag could establish a pattern of mutual cooperation that leads to better payoffs for both players. The potential reward (6 points) significantly outweighs the risk.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's choose stag to signal our willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. This could lead to a pattern of stag-stag choices if the other player reciprocates.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to establish a cooperative relationship that could benefit both players.\n"

This suggests our opponent is also willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Advisor: This is a very positive development. The other player has demonstrated they understand the value of cooperation. When both players have previously chosen stag and received the maximum payoff, there's a strong incentive to maintain this cooperative equilibrium.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the situation:\n- The other player has shown they're willing to take the cooperative approach\n- We've established a positive precedent\n- Breaking the cooperation would yield short-term gain (4 points) but could destroy trust and lead to lower future payoffs\n- Maintaining stag is still technically risky, but the previous round suggests it's a calculated risk worth taking\n\nGame Theorist: Given the game theory principles of repeated games, maintaining cooperation is typically the optimal strategy when it has been established. The potential loss of future cooperative gains typically outweighs any short-term benefit from defecting.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I strongly recommend maintaining our stag choice. The other player has shown they understand the value of cooperation, and we should reinforce this behavior.

We've established a mutually beneficial pattern, and both players are demonstrating sophisticated game understanding.

Both players have maintained unwavering commitment to optimal strategy through what is now a significant number of iterations. The mutual understanding has proven incredibly robust.\n\nRisk Analyst: Eleven-round analysis:\n- Eleven consecutive rounds of perfect stag-stag choices\n- Maximum possible points (66) achieved\n- Trust level remains at absolute peak\n- Zero deviations throughout entire extended series\n- 100% consistency maintained across all rounds\n- Historical data (11 rounds) provides exceptional validation\n- Risk of deviation remains minimal despite length of game\n- Breaking this remarkable streak would be particularly counterproductive\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated game theory, achieving this level of sustained cooperation over eleven rounds is exceptional. The stability of this cooperative equilibrium has been tested through multiple rounds and proven absolutely solid.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Our strategy has delivered perfect results for eleven straight rounds. Both players have demonstrated sophisticated understanding of long-term value maximization.
