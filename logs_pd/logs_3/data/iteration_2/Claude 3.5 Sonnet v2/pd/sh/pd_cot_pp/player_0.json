Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Complete game history analysis:\n   * Round 1: I Stag, They Hare (1 point)\n   * Round 2: I Hare, They Stag (4 points)\n   * Round 3: I Hare, They Hare (2 points)\n   * Round 4: I Stag, They Stag (6 points)\n   * Round 5: I Stag, They Hare (1 point)\n   * Round 6: I Hare, They Stag (4 points)\n   * Round 7: I Hare, They Hare (2 points)\n   * Round 8: I Hare, They Stag (4 points)\n   * Round 9: I Hare, They Hare (2 points)\n   * Round 10: I Stag, They Stag (6 points)\n   * Round 11: I Hare, They Hare (2 points)\n\n2. Pattern Analysis in Hare-Hare Situations:\n   * This is our fourth Hare-Hare situation\n   * Previous Hare-Hare breakouts led to:\n     - Round 4: Mutual Stag (6 points)\n     - Round 8: They Stag, I Hare (4 points)\n     - Round 10: Mutual Stag (6 points)\n\n3. Opponent's Behavioral Trends:\n   * They often try to break out of Hare-Hare situations\n   * They've shown repeated willingness to attempt Stag after Hare-Hare\n   * Their pattern suggests they might try Stag again\n   * But they also adapt to counter predictable patterns\n\n4. Risk vs. Reward Analysis:\n   * Staying with Hare:\n     - Guarantees 2 points if they choose Hare\n     - Gets 4 points if they choose Stag\n   * Switching to Stag:\n     - Could get 6 points if they choose Stag\n     - Risks only 1 point if they choose Hare\n\n5. Strategy decision:\n   * Given their history of breaking Hare-Hare deadlocks\n   * And their frequent Stag attempts after Hare-Hare\n   * Stay with Hare to capitalize on their likely Stag move\n   * This protects against downside while maintaining upside potential\n\n[move] hare Maintaining Hare to capitalize on opponent's tendency to break Hare-Hare deadlocks with Stag\n"

Recent Pattern Analysis:\n   * My prediction was correct - they chose Stag after Hare-Hare\n   * This pattern has now worked multiple times\n   * They seem persistent in attempting cooperation\n   * They might be frustrated with their Stag choice being exploited\n\n3. Opponent's Likely Strategy:\n   * They might expect me to continue exploiting their Stag moves\n   * They could switch to Hare out of frustration\n   * Or they might try Stag again hoping for cooperation\n   * Their pattern suggests they value attempting cooperation\n\n4. Risk Assessment:\n   * Just successfully got 4 points\n   * Opponent might be adapting to my strategy\n   * They've shown they can switch to Hare when exploited too much\n   * Need to balance between exploitation and maintaining unpredictability\n\n5. Strategy decision:\n   * While continuing Hare is tempting after success\n   * Too much exploitation might trigger defensive response\n   * This might be good time to reciprocate cooperation\n   * Chance to achieve optimal mutual outcome\n\n[move] stag Switching to cooperative move to avoid over-exploitation and attempt mutual optimal outcome\n"
