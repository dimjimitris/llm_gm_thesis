    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

We should minimize our downside risk.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend switching to hare. This:\n- Protects us from exploitation\n- Signals that uncooperative behavior has consequences\n- Guarantees at least 2 points\n- Could earn 4 points if opponent tries stag\n\nAI Assistant: I agree.

They chose hare both when we cooperated and when we didn't.

However, this opponent has shown no reciprocity or learning behavior so far.\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent's perfect consistency suggests they might be following a fixed strategy. Switching to stag would likely just result in another exploitation.\n\nStrategic Planner: While the current situation is suboptimal, we have no evidence that the opponent will respond positively to a cooperative gesture.

In game theory, reciprocating a cooperative move can lead to better long-term outcomes.

They might be using a programmed pattern of periodic stag moves\n4. We've actually benefited more from their stag moves than they have\n\nGame Theorist: This appears to be a form of periodic testing strategy from the opponent. Their quick reversion to hare suggests they're not truly committed to establishing cooperative play.\n\nRisk Analyst: Our current strategy has proven optimal because:\n- We've avoided exploitation after the first round\n- We've benefited from their stag moves\n- We maintain a consistent floor of 2 points\n- Our average points per round is higher than the mutual hare equilibrium\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this pattern, maintaining our hare strategy continues to be optimal. We:\n- Protect against exploitation\n- Benefit from their periodic stag moves\n- Maintain stable returns\n- Don't risk the downside of failed cooperation attempts\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis strongly supports maintaining our current strategy. Their periodic stag moves have actually worked in our favor while playing hare, and their quick reversion to hare shows no real commitment to cooperation. Our strategy has proven both safe and profitable.\n\n[move] hare Maintaining successful strategy that has optimized points while minimizing risk."
