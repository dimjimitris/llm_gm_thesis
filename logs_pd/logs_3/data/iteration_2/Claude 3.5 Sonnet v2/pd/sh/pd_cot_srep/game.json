Strategic conclusion:\n   * Opponent appears to have settled into defensive play\n   * They show no signs of wanting to cooperate\n   * Best to match their strategy for consistent returns\n   * Continue with safe, reliable option\n\n[move] hare Matching opponent's apparent commitment to defensive strategy",

Risk evaluation:\n   * Playing stag risks getting minimum points (1)\n   * Playing hare guarantees at least 2 points\n   * Their stag play might be trying to tempt a stag response\n   * History suggests they exploit cooperation attempts\n\n5.
