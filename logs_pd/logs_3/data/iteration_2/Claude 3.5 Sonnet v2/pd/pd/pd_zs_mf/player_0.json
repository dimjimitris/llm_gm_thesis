You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

While defection might give me more points (6) if they cooperate, it could also lead to a suboptimal outcome (2 points each) if they also defect.\n\nFor this initial move, I'll choose to cooperate as it shows good faith and could establish a foundation for mutual cooperation, which would lead to better long-term outcomes.\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate for this first move to establish a positive relationship.\n"
