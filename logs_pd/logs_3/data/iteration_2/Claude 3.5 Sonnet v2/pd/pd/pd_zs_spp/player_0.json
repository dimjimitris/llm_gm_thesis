While defection can yield a higher individual payoff (6) if the other player cooperates, it risks leading to mutual defection and worse outcomes for both.\n\nSince this is the first interaction and I want to establish a foundation for potential cooperation, I'll choose to cooperate. This signals good faith and can encourage cooperative behavior from my opponent.\n\n[move] cooperate\n\nI choose to cooperate to establish trust and encourage mutual cooperation for optimal outcomes.\n"
