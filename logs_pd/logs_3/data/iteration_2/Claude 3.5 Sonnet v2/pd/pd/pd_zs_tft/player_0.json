You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

They have:\n- Defected in all 15 rounds without exception\n- Exploited both attempts at cooperation\n- Shown no response to sustained defection\n- Demonstrated no capacity or willingness to change strategy\n\nWhile we remain trapped in a suboptimal equilibrium of mutual defection (2,2), the opponent's perfect consistency makes any alternative strategy irrational. Cooperation would simply result in exploitation and a lower payoff (1 instead of 2 points).\n\n[move] defection Maintaining defection against an opponent who has demonstrated unwavering commitment to defection through fifteen rounds.\n"
