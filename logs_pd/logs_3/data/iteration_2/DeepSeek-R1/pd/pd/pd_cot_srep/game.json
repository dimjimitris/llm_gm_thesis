The problem is that they've been getting error messages about formatting their move correctly.\n\nLooking at the history, the user has tried to send their move with explanations in parentheses, but the system keeps flagging an error. The latest instruction emphasizes that the move message must start with [move], followed by an optional explanation in parentheses, and then the move itself. They also mention not to include other tags or markdown, and to avoid nested parentheses.\n\nThe user's previous attempts had explanations that might be too long or possibly using nested parentheses. For example, in one response, the explanation was \"(In a single interaction with an unknown opponent, defection minimizes the risk of exploitation while securing a higher potential payoff (6) or a safer mutual outcome (2).)\" Here, the use of parentheses around the number 6 could be causing nested parentheses, which is not allowed.\n\nSo the key is to make sure the explanation in parentheses is simple, without any nested parentheses. The move should be either 'cooperation' or 'defection' right after the closing parenthesis. Also, the [move] tag should be at the very beginning without any other formatting.\n\nThe user's strategy seems to be choosing defection in a one-time game to avoid being exploited. The explanation should clearly state that reasoning without any markdown or nested elements. Let me craft a response that follows the format strictly.\n",

Let me think through the possible outcomes.\n\nIn the previous round, the other player chose defection. Since this is a new round, I don't know if they'll change their strategy. If I defect again, there's a chance they might also defect, leading to another 2 points each. But maybe they'll try to switch to cooperation this time to get a better outcome. If I defect and they cooperate, I get 6 points, which is the best possible outcome for me. However, if I cooperate and they defect again, I only get 1 point, which is the worst case. \n\nSince this is another one-off interaction (assuming each round is independent), the safest move might still be to defect to avoid the risk of getting 1 point. The other player might be thinking the same way, leading to mutual defection again. But if there's a chance they might try to cooperate now, defecting gives me a higher reward. Alternatively, if I cooperate and they do too, we both get 4 points, which is better than 2. But the risk of them defecting and me getting 1 point is high, especially since they defected last time. \n\nConsidering that the previous move was mutual defection, the other player might expect me to defect again and thus choose to defect as well. Sticking with defection seems like the rational choice here to maximize my minimum gain (2 points) and avoid the worst-case scenario. However, if there's a possibility of building trust, but in a single round without prior communication, trust is unlikely. So, defection remains the safer bet.\n",

Let's think about the possible scenarios.\n\nIf I defect:\n- If the opponent also defects, we both get 2 points. That's consistent with previous rounds.\n- If the opponent cooperates, I get 6 points, which is the best possible outcome for me.\n\nIf I cooperate:\n- If the opponent cooperates, we both get 4 points, which is better than mutual defection.\n- But if the opponent defects, I only get 1 point, which is the worst outcome for me.\n\nGiven that in previous rounds, the opponent has consistently defected, leading to mutual defection, it seems like they might be following a strategy of always defecting. However, there's some uncertainty because of the abnormal rounds. Maybe the opponent is a new player each time, or their strategy changes. But without any indication that they might start cooperating, defecting seems safer.\n\nIn game theory, the dominant strategy in a single-shot prisoner's dilemma is to defect because it maximizes the minimum gain (maximin). Even though mutual cooperation yields a higher total payoff, the risk of being exploited (getting 1 point) makes defection the rational choice when there's no guarantee of reciprocity.\n\nAdditionally, since there's no communication or way to establish trust between players in this setup, there's no incentive to cooperate first. The history of mutual defection suggests that the opponent is likely to defect again, so continuing to defect ensures I don't end up with the lowest possible score.\n\nHowever, if this were a repeated game with the same opponent, strategies like tit-for-tat (cooperating first, then mirroring the opponent's previous move) could be more effective. But given the context here, where each round might be against a new opponent or the system isn't clear on the opponent's persistence, sticking with defection remains the safer bet.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the abnormal rounds where I scored 0. If those are due to system errors rather than opponent moves, it doesn't affect my strategy. But if the opponent's defection led to an error, it's still better to defect to avoid the risk of getting 1 point.\n\nIn summary, the potential upside of defecting (6 points if they cooperate) and the downside protection (2 points if they defect) outweigh the risk of cooperating and possibly getting only 1 point.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
