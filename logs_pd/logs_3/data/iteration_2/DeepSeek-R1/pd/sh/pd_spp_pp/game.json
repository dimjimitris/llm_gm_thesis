Since the other player is new, maybe they'll choose stag first, thinking it's the best. But maybe they'll be risk-averse. It's a bit of a gamble. Maybe starting with stag to test the waters.

Let me think about the payoff matrix again.\n\nIf both choose stag, we both get 6. That's the best outcome. But if I choose stag and the other player doesn't, I get only 1. If I choose hare, then if they choose stag, I get 4, which is better. If both choose hare, we both get 2. So maybe choosing hare is safer? But the opponent is a fresh player. Maybe they'll try to go for stag again? Or maybe they'll switch after seeing that I chose stag last time. \n\nWait, in the first round, I chose stag and they chose hare. So they got 4 points. Maybe they think I'll switch to hare this time to avoid getting 1 again. If I choose hare now, and they choose stag again, I get 4. If they also choose hare, we both get 2. But if I stick with stag and they switch to stag, we both get 6. But since they got a good result last time by choosing hare, maybe they'll stick with hare. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to exploit me by choosing hare again. If I choose hare this time, I can at least get 2 points instead of risking 1 again. But if they switch to stag, I get 4. Hmm. It's a bit of a dilemma. Since the opponent is new, maybe they don't have a fixed strategy yet. Maybe they'll try to alternate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to signal cooperation by choosing stag again, hoping they'll switch. But if they keep choosing hare, I keep losing. Maybe I should switch to hare to ensure I don't get the lowest payoff. Let me balance the possible outcomes. If I choose hare, the worst I get is 2, which is better than 1. The best is 4. If I choose stag, the best is 6, but the worst is 1. Since the opponent just got 4 points by choosing hare, they might do it again. So maybe choosing hare is safer this time to get at least 2 points. But I want to maximize my points. Maybe I should try to see if they'll cooperate. But how? Since they're a new player, maybe they don't know the optimal strategy yet. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can alternate my moves. Since I chose stag last time and they chose hare, maybe they expect me to switch. If I switch to hare, and they switch to stag, I get 4. If they stay on hare, I get 2. If I stay on stag and they switch to stag, I get 6. But if they stay on hare, I get 1 again. It's a risk. \n\nGiven that the opponent is new, maybe they'll continue to choose hare because it gave them a higher payoff last time. So to avoid getting 1 again, I should choose hare this time. That way, if they choose hare again, I get 2, which is better than 1. If they switch to stag, I get 4. Either way, it's better than risking another 1. So maybe hare is the safer choice here.\n",

Then in the second round, I switched to hare, and they went stag, so I got 4 points. Now, what's the best move for the next round?\n\nHmm, the opponent seems to be alternating or maybe trying to trick me. First, they defected when I cooperated, then they cooperated when I defected. Maybe they're trying to predict my moves. If I keep switching, they might catch on. But what's the optimal strategy here?\n\nIf I go stag again, maybe they expect me to switch back and they'll choose hare again. But if they choose stag this time, we both get 6. But after I chose hare last time, they might think I'll stick with hare, so they might choose hare again to get 2 points instead of risking 1. Alternatively, they might try to exploit me by choosing stag, hoping I go back to stag. This is a bit of a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, sticking with hare could be safer. If they choose stag again, I get 4. If they choose hare, we both get 2. But 2 is better than 1 if they defect. But if I keep choosing hare, the opponent might start choosing hare too, leading to mutual 2 points each time. But maybe alternating could maximize my points based on their past behavior.\n\nWait, the opponent's moves were hare then stag. So maybe they're alternating? If that's the case, next they might choose hare again. If I choose stag, I get 1 point. If I choose hare, we both get 2. But if they are alternating, then next move is hare. So choosing hare would give me 2, which is better than 1. But if they don't alternate and choose stag again, then choosing hare gives me 4. Hmm, but how predictable is the opponent?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to tit-for-tat. They responded to my stag with hare, then to my hare with stag. If I follow tit-for-tat, I should mirror their last move. Their last move was stag, so I should play stag. But in that case, if they play hare again, I get 1. If they play stag, we both get 6. But given their previous two moves (hare, stag), it's unclear. Maybe they're random.\n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs, the safest move to maximize the minimum gain (maximin) is hare, because the worst case is 2 points, whereas stag's worst case is 1. So maybe hare is safer. But if I can predict their move, maybe stag is better. But without knowing their strategy, it's risky.\n\nGiven the previous two rounds, the opponent first defected, then cooperated. Maybe they're testing my reactions. If I switch back to stag, they might defect again. But if I stick with hare, they might start defecting too. Alternatively, maybe they're trying to alternate. It's hard to tell. \n\nIn game theory, the Nash equilibrium here is both choosing hare, leading to 2 each. But if there's a chance to coordinate on stag, that's better. But with a new player, maybe they're not coordinating. Since in the first round they chose hare, then stag, perhaps they're trying to exploit. Maybe the best is to choose hare again to avoid the risk of getting 1. So I'll go with hare again.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move for the next round. Let me start by reviewing the previous rounds to understand the opponent's behavior.\n\nIn the first round, I chose stag, hoping for mutual cooperation. But the opponent picked hare, so I got 1 point. That was a bit of a letdown. Then, in the second round, I switched to hare, and the opponent went stag, giving me 4 points. That worked out well. The third round, I stuck with hare again, and this time both of us chose hare, resulting in 2 points each. \n\nHmm, so the opponent's pattern seems a bit unpredictable. They started with hare, then stag, then hare. Maybe they're testing my reactions. If I consider the possible payoffs again: \n\n- If both choose stag, we both get 6. That's the best outcome, but it requires trust.\n- If both choose hare, we get 2 each. Safe but low reward.\n- If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1, which is bad.\n- If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4, which is good.\n\nSince the opponent has alternated between hare and stag, maybe they're trying to exploit my choices. After I chose hare twice, they might expect me to continue with hare. If they think I'll keep choosing hare, they might switch to stag to get 4 points. But if I switch back to stag, maybe they'll also choose stag this time, leading to the higher payoff. \n\nAlternatively, if I keep choosing hare, the worst I get is 2 points, which is better than risking 1 point if they choose hare again. But if I can get them to cooperate, stag would be better. However, given their past behavior, they might not be cooperative. \n\nWait, in the third round, both of us chose hare. Maybe the opponent is settling into a pattern of alternating or mirroring. If I choose stag now, they might choose hare again, but if they noticed I switched to hare after the first round, they might expect me to stay with hare. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. Maybe a tit-for-tat strategy would work here. If the opponent defected (chose hare) in the first round, I defect in the next. But they did switch to stag in the second round when I chose hare. Then in the third round, they went back to hare. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they alternate moves. If that's the case, after hare in the third round, they might go back to stag in the fourth. If I choose hare again, I could get 4 points if they choose stag, or 2 if they choose hare. But if I choose stag, I risk 1 point if they choose hare, but gain 6 if they choose stag. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps a safer approach is to stick with hare to ensure at least 2 points, but if I want to try for higher rewards, maybe test the waters with stag again. However, since the opponent has chosen hare twice out of three times, maybe they're more inclined to defect. \n\nAlternatively, since the last round was mutual hare, maybe the opponent will expect me to continue with hare and thus choose hare again. If I switch to stag, I might get 1 point if they choose hare, but if they also switch to stag, we both benefit. \n\nBut given the risk, maybe it's better to alternate strategies. Since I chose hare twice, maybe the opponent expects me to continue, so they might choose hare again. If I choose stag now, I could get 1 or 6. But if I choose hare, I get 2 or 4. \n\nHmm. The opponent's last move was hare. If they follow a pattern of their own previous move, they might repeat hare. If I choose hare again, we both get 2. If I choose stag, I risk 1. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to stag, they might choose hare again. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Maybe the best approach is to alternate between hare and stag to keep the opponent guessing. Since I've chosen hare twice, switching to stag might surprise them. But if they're also alternating, maybe they'll choose stag this time. \n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs, the maximum gain is 6, but the risk is high. The safe choice is hare for 2. But if I can establish a cooperative pattern, maybe stag is better. However, given the opponent's inconsistency, it's hard to predict. \n\nI think I'll take a calculated risk and choose stag this time, hoping the opponent might also switch to stag for mutual benefit.

Then when I switched to hare, they went stag, so I got 4 points. The next round, both of us chose hare, resulting in 2 points each. Then when I tried stag again, they also chose stag, leading to the maximum payoff. \n\nHmm, so the opponent might be reacting to my previous moves. After I chose stag again, they cooperated. Maybe they're using a tit-for-tat strategy, where they mirror my last move. Let me test that. If I keep choosing stag, will they continue to do the same? But if they switch back to hare, I could end up with 1 point again. Alternatively, if I stick with stag, maybe they'll keep cooperating. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to alternate strategies. But after the last successful cooperation, perhaps they're more inclined to cooperate again. However, if I switch to hare now, I could get 4 points if they choose stag, but if they also choose hare, we both get 2. But since the last time we both chose stag, maybe they expect me to continue with stag. \n\nWait, the goal is to maximize my points. If I choose stag again and they do too, that's 6 points. If they switch to hare, I get 1. If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4. If they choose hare, I get 2. So the risk-reward is higher for stag.

If they defect (choose hare), I can adjust in the next round.

When I chose hare before, they went stag once, giving me 4 points. Then when I chose hare again, they also chose hare, so we both got 2. Then I switched back to stag, and they went stag too, giving us 6 each. But then the next time I stayed with stag, they went hare again.

Then when I go hare again, they go stag again. Wait, no, after the mutual hare, I went stag and they went stag too. Then next round I went stag again, they went hare. Then I went hare, they went stag. \n\nHmm, maybe the opponent is trying to exploit my stag choices by sometimes defecting to hare.

But if the opponent is unpredictable, maybe I should aim for a safer choice. The highest mutual payoff is both stag (6 each), but if the opponent defects, I get only 1. If I choose hare, the worst I can get is 2 if both choose hare, or 4 if they choose stag. \n\nSince the opponent has alternated between stag and hare, maybe I can try to anticipate their move. After I chose hare last time and they chose stag, maybe they'll expect me to choose hare again and they might choose hare to get 2 points instead of risking me choosing stag. Or maybe they'll try to go stag again to get 6 if I also go stag. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a tit-for-tat strategy would work. If they defected last time (chose hare when I chose stag), I should defect next time. But in the last round, I chose hare and they chose stag. So they cooperated (stag) while I defected (hare). That gave me 4 points. If I follow tit-for-tat, I should reciprocate their last move. Their last move was stag, so I should choose stag this time. But if I do that and they choose hare again, I get 1. But if they choose stag again, we both get 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they alternate based on my previous moves. Let's see the sequence of my moves: stag, hare, hare, stag, stag, hare. Their moves: hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag. So their moves are hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag. It seems like they are alternating between hare and stag regardless of my moves. If that's the case, then their next move would be hare. So if I choose hare, we both get 2. If I choose stag, I get 1. So choosing hare would be safer. \n\nBut wait, in the last round, their move was stag. If the pattern is alternating, next would be hare. So if I choose hare, we both get hare (2 points). If I choose stag, I get 1. So hare is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to exploit a pattern. If I keep switching, they might adjust. But based on their past moves, the alternating pattern seems consistent. So I should choose hare to get 2 points instead of risking 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to break their pattern by choosing stag, hoping they switch back to stag. But given that when I chose stag twice in a row before, they went stag once and hare once. So maybe it's not reliable. \n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs, the safest bet is to choose hare to ensure at least 2 points, with a chance of 4 if they choose stag. Since the opponent's last move was stag, maybe they'll switch back to hare. If I choose hare, I either get 2 or 4. If I choose stag, I get 1 or 6. Given the risk of 1 vs potential 6, but the opponent's pattern suggests they might choose hare next, so stag would be bad. \n\nSo, probably better to choose hare to secure at least 2, possibly 4.\n",

They alternated between hare and stag but not in a clear pattern. Maybe they're using a strategy where they choose hare more often, especially after I choose hare. \n\nIf I choose stag now, there's a chance they might choose hare again, leading to 1 point. But if they choose stag, we both get 6. However, given their tendency to choose hare when I choose stag, maybe it's too risky. \n\nAlternatively, sticking with hare ensures at least 2 points if they also choose hare, or 4 if they choose stag. Since in the last round, when I chose hare, they chose hare, maybe they're settling into a mutual hare pattern. If I keep choosing hare, maybe they'll continue to do so, giving me 2 each time. But 2 is better than risking 1. \n\nBut maybe the opponent is also adjusting. If I keep choosing hare, they might start choosing stag to exploit me. Wait, in round 5, when I chose hare, they chose stag, giving me 4. Then in round 6, I chose hare again, and they chose hare. So maybe after getting 4 points, they switched back to hare to avoid giving me more points. \n\nThis is tricky. The optimal strategy in game theory for the stag hunt is to cooperate (stag) if you trust the other player to do the same, but defect (hare) if you think they'll defect. Since the opponent has defected more often when I chose stag, maybe the safe choice is hare. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to signal cooperation by choosing stag again, hoping they'll reciprocate. But given the history, they might not. \n\nAlternatively, use a mixed strategy. But since this is a repeated game, maybe a tit-for-tat approach: start with stag, then do what the opponent did last. Last time they chose hare, so I choose hare. \n\nWait, in the last round, opponent chose hare. So tit-for-tat would mean I choose hare this time. That way, if they keep choosing hare, I do too. If they switch to stag, I follow next time. \n\nBut tit-for-tat can lead to mutual cooperation if both start cooperating. However, given that the opponent has been inconsistent, maybe it's better to stick with hare for safety. \n\nAlternatively, since the last mutual hare gave 2 points, and the opponent might continue with hare, choosing hare again would secure 2.

User: hare \u2192 Opponent: hare\n\nHmm, the opponent's moves are: hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare. So every time the user switches to a new move, the opponent alternates. But when the user repeats a move, the opponent sometimes alternates. For example, after user chose hare twice (rounds 2 and 3), opponent went stag then hare. Then when user chose stag (round 4), opponent went stag. Then user chose stag again (round 5), opponent went hare. Then user chose hare (round 6), opponent went stag. Then user chose hare again (round 7), opponent went hare. Then user chose hare again (round 8), opponent went stag. Then user chose hare again (round 9), opponent went hare.\n\nThis seems a bit random. Maybe the opponent is using a mixed strategy. Alternatively, they might be trying to exploit when I play stag by defecting (choosing hare) to get higher points. But when I play hare, they sometimes choose stag to get 4 points, but other times choose hare to get 2.\n\nIf the opponent is unpredictable, maybe the best strategy is to choose hare to minimize the risk. If I choose hare, the worst I can get is 2 points (if they also choose hare), which is better than the 1 point if I choose stag and they defect. Alternatively, if I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4 points. So the expected value might be higher with hare.\n\nAlternatively, if I can establish a pattern of cooperation (both choosing stag), that's the highest payoff. But the opponent doesn't seem to consistently cooperate. They only did that once when I chose stag twice in a row (rounds 4 and 5). Wait, in round 4, I chose stag and they chose stag. Then in round 5, I chose stag again, but they chose hare. So maybe they cooperated once but then defected. So maybe they are not reciprocating consistently.\n\nGiven that, maybe the safest bet is to stick with hare. Because even if they choose stag, I get 4, and if they choose hare, I get 2. That's better than risking 1 point by choosing stag. Unless there's a way to encourage them to cooperate, but given the history, they don't seem to respond to that consistently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a tit-for-tat strategy: do what the opponent did last time. Last round, the opponent chose hare. So if I follow tit-for-tat, I should choose hare. But in the previous round, I chose hare and they chose hare. Wait, no, the last round ended with both choosing hare, so the opponent's last move was hare. So tit-for-tat would mean choosing hare again. But if I do that, maybe they'll choose hare again, leading to 2 points. Or if they switch to stag, I get 4.\n\nAlternatively, if I switch to stag, maybe they'll choose stag again, leading to 6. But given that when I chose stag twice before, they defected the second time, maybe they won't cooperate again.\n\nThis is tricky. The opponent's behavior is inconsistent. Maybe the best approach is to alternate between hare and stag to try to maximize points based on their possible responses. But given the uncertainty, sticking with hare seems safer. Alternatively, try stag again to see if they reciprocate, but that's risky.\n\nConsidering the previous interactions, when I chose hare multiple times, the opponent alternated between stag and hare. The last two times I chose hare, they chose stag and then hare. So maybe they are alternating when I keep choosing hare. If I choose hare again, they might choose stag again (alternating), giving me 4 points. But in the last round, when I chose hare, they chose hare. So maybe they are sometimes alternating, sometimes not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they choose hare if I chose hare last time, and stag if I chose stag. But that doesn't fit the history. For example, when I chose hare in round 2, they chose stag. Then I chose hare again in round 3, they chose hare. Then in round 4, I chose stag, they chose stag. Then in round 5, I chose stag again, they chose hare. So it's not consistent.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, the safest choice is to stick with hare. The potential payoffs are 4 or 2, which are better than the 6 or 1 from choosing stag. Since the opponent's behavior is unpredictable, minimizing the downside risk by choosing hare might be better.\n",

But how? Maybe by occasionally choosing stag to signal cooperation. But when I did that once, they defected. So maybe they aren't responsive. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to stick with hare to ensure at least 2 points and occasionally get 4.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide whether to choose stag or hare in this next round. The game is about strategic moves where the payoff depends on both my choice and the opponent's. Let me recap the previous rounds to understand the opponent's pattern.\n\nIn the first round, I chose stag, and the opponent chose hare, so I got 1 point. Then I switched to hare, and they chose stag, giving me 4 points. The next round, both chose hare, so 2 points each. Then I tried stag again, and they cooperated, so we both got 6. But then they defected again when I chose stag, leading to 1 point. Since then, I've been choosing hare, and sometimes they choose stag (I get 4) or hare (we both get 2). \n\nThe opponent seems to switch between stag and hare, but not in a predictable pattern. When I choose hare, sometimes they go stag, which benefits me, and sometimes they go hare, which is okay. If I keep choosing hare, I can avoid the risk of getting only 1 point if they defect. But maybe if I try stag again, there's a chance they might also choose stag, leading to the maximum 6 points. However, given that they've defected before when I chose stag, it's risky. \n\nConsidering the payoffs, hare gives me a minimum of 2 points if they also choose hare, and up to 4 if they choose stag. Stag could give me 6 if they cooperate, but 1 if they defect. Since the opponent's behavior is inconsistent, sticking with hare seems safer. But maybe alternating strategies could keep them guessing. However, since they sometimes choose stag when I choose hare, leading to 4 points, and other times hare for 2, it's better to maintain hare to ensure at least 2 points and occasionally get 4. The risk of stag isn't worth the potential 1 point loss. So, I'll go with hare again.\n",

The opponent seems to be switching between stag and hare unpredictably.\n\nLooking at the history, when the user chose stag initially, the opponent went hare, leading to a low score. Then switching to hare gave them 4 points when the opponent chose stag. But when both chose hare, they got 2 points. The opponent sometimes picks stag even when the user picks hare, which gives the user 4 points. However, when the user sticks with hare, sometimes the opponent also picks hare, resulting in 2 points. \n\nThe user's strategy has been to mostly choose hare to avoid the risk of getting 1 point if the opponent defects. But the opponent's moves are inconsistent. Maybe the user should try to see if the opponent will reciprocate cooperation if they switch back to stag. But the last few times they tried stag, the opponent went hare again. It's a risk. Alternatively, sticking with hare ensures at least 2 points and sometimes 4. But if the opponent starts cooperating, stag would give 6. However, the opponent hasn't shown a reliable pattern of cooperating. \n\nGiven the opponent's behavior, it might be safer to continue with hare to avoid the 1-point risk. The user has been getting 4 points when the opponent chooses stag and 2 when both choose hare. The opponent hasn't consistently chosen stag when the user does, so the potential 6-point reward is uncertain. Therefore, prioritizing consistent gains with hare seems better here.\n",

If I keep choosing hare, I either get 2 or 4 points. If I switch to stag, there's a chance for 6 if they also choose stag, but a risk of 1 if they don't. Given that the opponent has sometimes chosen stag when I did, maybe testing the waters again could be worth it. But the last few rounds they've been switching between stag and hare when I play hare. Maybe they're trying to exploit my hare strategy by sometimes choosing stag. \n\nAlternatively, if I switch to stag now, maybe they'll follow suit, thinking I'm trying to cooperate. But if they keep choosing hare, I'll lose points. It's a gamble. Since the opponent has been inconsistent, perhaps sticking with hare is safer. But the potential for higher reward with stag is tempting. Let's try stag once more to see if they'll cooperate again. If they do, we both get 6. If not, I lose a point.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
