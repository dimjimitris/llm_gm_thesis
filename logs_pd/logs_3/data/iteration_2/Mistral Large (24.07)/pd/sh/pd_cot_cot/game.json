Consider the risk and reward:\n   - Choosing Stag has a higher risk (could get only 1 point) but also a higher reward (could get 6 points).\n   - Choosing Hare has a lower risk (will get at least 2 points) but also a lower reward (maximum 4 points).\n\n4.

You gain 6 points if your opponent also chooses Stag, but only 1 point if your opponent chooses Hare.\n   - Choosing **Hare** is a low-risk, low-reward strategy. You gain 4 points if your opponent chooses Stag, but only 2 points if your opponent chooses Hare.\n\n3. **Consider the Opponent's Strategy:**\n   - Given that the opponent is a fresh player and lacks a known strategy, assume a balanced or conservative approach initially.\n\n4. **Best Initial Move:**\n   - Choosing **Stag** initially can test the opponent's response and show willingness to cooperate for higher rewards.\n   - If the opponent also chooses Stag, both players benefit significantly.\n   - If the opponent chooses Hare, you can adjust your strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\n### Final Decision:\nBased on the initial analysis and willingness to test the opponent's strategy, the best move to maximize initial points and understand the opponent is:\n\n```plaintext\n[move] I choose to go with Stag to start, aiming for the higher reward if the opponent cooperates.\n```\n\nThis strategic choice allows you to explore the opponent's inclination and potentially secure a higher payoff.\n"
