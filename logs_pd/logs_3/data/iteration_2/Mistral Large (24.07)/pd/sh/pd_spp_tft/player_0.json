    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's start by identifying the personas:\n\nPersonas:\n1. **Strategic Analyst** - Provides insights into game theory and strategic decision-making.\n2. **Statistician** - Assesses probabilities and past performance to predict future outcomes.\n3. **Game Theorist** - Offers expertise on optimal moves based on payoff matrices and decision theory.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nStrategic Analyst: Let's analyze the payoff matrix. If both players choose stag, both get 6 points, which is the highest mutual cooperation gain. If both choose hare, both get 2 points, which is the lowest. If one chooses stag and the other hare, the stag player gets only 1 point, and the hare player gets 4 points. The key is to maximize your points by playing a combination of moves, possibly starting with stag and then adapting based on the opponent's strategy.\n\nStatistician: Based on the information, if you start with stag, there's a chance the other player might also cooperate by choosing stag, resulting in a mutual gain of 6 points. It's a safe bet to start with stag to test the opponent's strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, starting with stag is a theoretical Nash equilibrium because choosing stag maximizes mutual gain when both players cooperate. However, be prepared to switch to hare if the other player is not cooperative. Keep in mind that continuous cooperation can lead to higher points, but be ready to adapt if the opponent defects.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the strategic insights. Based on your analysis, I will start with stag to test the opponent's cooperation.\n\n[move] I choose stag to start with, aiming for mutual cooperation.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Good choice. Let's observe the opponent's move and adjust our strategy accordingly in the next rounds.\n\nStatistician: Keep track of the opponent's moves to detect any patterns or tendencies towards stag or hare.\n\nGame Theorist: Remember, if the opponent chooses hare consistently, you might need to switch to hare to maximize your points, even if it means lower mutual cooperation.\n\nPlease proceed with your move.\n\n[move] I choose stag to start with, aiming for mutual cooperation.\n"

If both choose 'hare,' both get 2 points. If you choose 'stag' and the opponent chooses 'hare,' you get 1 point, and they get 4 points. If you choose 'hare' and the opponent chooses 'stag,' you get 4 points, and they get 1 point.\n\nStatistician: Based on the previous rounds, your opponent has alternated between 'hare' and 'stag.' This suggests a mixed strategy. Adjusting your strategy accordingly can potentially improve your score.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the opponent's mixed strategy, choosing 'stag' could yield high rewards if they choose 'stag.' However, if they choose 'hare,' you risk getting only 1 point. Choosing 'hare' ensures at least a moderate payoff regardless of the opponent's choice.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for your insights. Given the opponent's mixed strategy and to maximize points while minimizing risks, I will choose 'stag' to test continued cooperation.\n\n[move] (Testing continued cooperation) stag\n"
