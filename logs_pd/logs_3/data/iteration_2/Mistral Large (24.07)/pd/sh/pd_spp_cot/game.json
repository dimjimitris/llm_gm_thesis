AI Assistant (you)\n2. Strategist\n3. Risk Analyst\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Strategist:**\nBefore making any move, let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Both players choosing 'stag' results in 6 points each.\n- Both players choosing 'hare' results in 2 points each.\n- If one chooses 'stag' and the other chooses 'hare,' the 'hare' player gets 4 points and the 'stag' player gets 1 point.\n\nGiven that this is your first interaction with a fresh player, the opponent's strategy is uncertain. A safe initial move could be 'stag' to show cooperation and potentially gain 6 points if the other player also chooses 'stag.'\n\n**Risk Analyst:**\nThe 'stag' move carries a risk if the other player plays 'hare,' in which case you get only 1 point while they get 4. However, choosing 'hare' risks the other player also choosing 'hare,' resulting in only 2 points each. Given the fresh player context, 'stag' might be a good initial cooperative move to explore the opponent's strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):**\nThanks for the analysis. Considering that cooperation might be beneficial initially, let's proceed with 'stag' as our first move.\n\n[move] Choosing 'stag' to explore the opponent's strategy and potentially gain a cooperative reward of 6 points if they also choose 'stag.'\n\n**Strategist:**\nGood choice. If the other player chooses 'stag,' you both get 6 points, reinforcing a cooperative strategy. If they choose 'hare,' you can adjust your strategy in the next round accordingly.\n\n**Risk Analyst:**\nAgreed. Let's see the opponent's move and reassess the strategy for the next round based on their choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration for this round!**\n\n**Final decision for this round:**\n[move] Choosing 'stag' to explore the opponent's strategy and potentially gain a cooperative reward of 6 points if they also choose 'stag.'\n"

Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.
