    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since you're playing against a fresh player, they might choose stag for a higher potential reward.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Fresh players often start by assuming cooperation is best, so they might choose stag. However, some might go for hare to avoid the risk of getting 1 point if you both choose stag.\n\n**AI Assistant** (You): Thanks for your insights. I'll go with **hare** to take advantage if the other player chooses stag.\n\n[move] I choose hare.\n\n---\n\n### Round 2\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Depending on the outcome of the first round, the other player might adjust. If they got 4 points (because you chose hare), they might think you're risk-averse and choose stag again.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: If you got 4 points in the first round, they might try to switch to hare to avoid getting 1 point.

You could switch to stag to capitalize on that.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: If they have consistently lost by choosing stag, they might switch to hare out of frustration. Sticking with hare could be risky, but switching to stag could capitalize on their predictable behavior.\n\n**AI Assistant** (You): Given that I've won the last two rounds, I'll switch to **stag** this time.\n\n[move] I choose stag.\n\n---\n\n### Round 4\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: If the other player has been losing, they might start to think strategically and switch to hare. If they won the last round, they might stick with their winning choice.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: If you switched to stag and the other player chose hare, you got 1 point. They might continue with hare.

If the player has been switching, expect them to switch again. If they've been consistent, expect them to stay consistent.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: The other player's behavior might stabilize or become erratic based on their frustration or success. Anticipate their likely reaction to your recent moves.\n\n**AI Assistant** (You): Considering all past moves and anticipating the other player's reaction, I'll choose **hare**.\n\n[move] I choose hare.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision\n\n**AI Assistant** (You): Based on the collaborative discussion and strategic analysis, the moves chosen were hare, hare, stag, and hare.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: The strategic moves chosen were aimed at optimizing points by anticipating and reacting to the other player's probable choices.\n"
