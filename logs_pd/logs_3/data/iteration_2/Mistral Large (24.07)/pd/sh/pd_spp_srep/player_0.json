    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic Stag Hunt game, where mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) yields the highest mutual reward, but there is an incentive to defect to get a higher personal reward if the other player cooperates and chooses stag.\n\nRisk Management Specialist: We should consider the risks involved. Choosing hare is a safer option if you're uncertain about the other player's move, as you will get at least 2 points even if the other player chooses hare as well. However, choosing stag has the potential for a much higher reward if both players cooperate.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Considering this is the fresh player we are dealing with, their strategy might not be fully developed. Should we start with a cooperative move to set a positive tone and potentially encourage mutual cooperation?\n\nStrategic Gaming Expert: Starting with a cooperative move like stag can indeed signal your willingness to cooperate and may influence the other player to do the same. However, be prepared to adjust your strategy based on their response.\n\nRisk Management Specialist: Agreed. Starting with stag is a good approach. If the other player also chooses stag, you both get 6 points, which is the best outcome. If they choose hare, you still get 1 point, which is not too bad for the initial round.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on your insights, let's go with stag for the first round.\n\n[move] I choose stag to start with a cooperative approach and encourage mutual cooperation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: [move] I choose stag to start with a cooperative approach and encourage mutual cooperation.\n"

Choosing stag when the other player also chooses stag yields the highest mutual reward, but there is a risk involved. If the other player chooses hare, you get the lowest points. Conversely, choosing hare is safer but has a lower maximum reward.\n\nRisk Management Specialist: Given that this is a strategic game, we need to balance the potential rewards with the associated risks. Choosing stag has high risk but high reward, while choosing hare is a safer bet with a lower reward. It's crucial to consider the other player's likely strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Let's analyze our first move.

However, if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get only 1 point, while they get 4 points. Conversely, choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, with a potential for 4 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\nRisk Management Specialist: We need to balance the potential rewards with the associated risks. Choosing hare ensures a minimum reward of 2 points regardless of the opponent's choice. Choosing stag could yield a high reward of 6 points if both players cooperate, but carries the risk of getting only 1 point if the opponent chooses hare.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given that in the previous round both players chose different moves and I scored 4 points, what should our next move be? Should we continue with hare to ensure a minimum reward or switch to stag to encourage cooperation?\n\nStrategic Gaming Expert: The opponent's previous choice of stag suggests they may be willing to cooperate. Switching to stag can signal your willingness to cooperate as well, which could encourage mutual cooperation. If both choose stag, both get 6 points. However, be prepared to adapt if the opponent chooses hare.\n\nRisk Management Specialist: Agreed. Switching to stag is a good approach. If the opponent also chooses stag, it's the best outcome. If they choose hare again, you still get 1 point, which is acceptable for maintaining a cooperative strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the advice, I'll switch to stag to encourage cooperation and potentially achieve a higher mutual reward.\n\n[move] (To encourage cooperation and potentially achieve a higher mutual reward) stag\n"
