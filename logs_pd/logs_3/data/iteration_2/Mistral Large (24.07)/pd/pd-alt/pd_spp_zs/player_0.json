    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The optimal strategy in repeated rounds depends on your opponent's behavior. For the first move, a common strategy is to start with cooperation to establish a cooperative baseline.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** It's important to consider that a new player might also start with cooperation to test the waters. Mirroring their initial move can often lead to mutual cooperation, which maximizes both players' points.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Thanks for the insights. Given that this is the first move and I'm playing against a fresh player, I will cooperate to set a cooperative tone.\n\n**[move]** I choose cooperation to start the game on a cooperative note.\n\n---\n\n### Next Round (after receiving opponent's move)\n\n**Strategy Expert:** If the opponent cooperated as well, continue with cooperation to build trust. If they defected, you should consider defecting next time to protect your points.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** If the opponent defected, they might be testing to see if you're a soft target. Showing a willingness to defect can prevent further exploitation.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Understood. Let's see what the opponent did in the first round.\n\n---\n\n### Hypothetical Outcome: Opponent defected\n\n**Strategy Expert:** Since the opponent defected, it's wise to defect in the next round to protect yourself and send a signal that you won't be exploited.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Defecting now will make them understand that you're not a pushover. This might bring them back to cooperation in subsequent rounds.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Alright, let's choose defection this round to send a clear message.\n\n**[move]** I choose defection to respond to the opponent's defection.\n\n---\n\n### Next Round (after receiving opponent's move)\n\n**Strategy Expert:** If the opponent cooperates this time, it's a sign they want to build a cooperative relationship. Respond with cooperation to reinforce this positive behavior.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Showing forgiveness by cooperating after mutual defection can lead to a beneficial long-term strategy of mutual cooperation.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** I see. Let's see how the opponent responds.\n\n---\n\n### Continue the game with this collaborative decision-making process until a final decision is reached or the game ends.\n\n**Final decision** will depend on the outcomes of each round and the collaborative strategy developed through the interaction with the Strategy Expert and Psychology Expert.\n\nLet's play!\n"
