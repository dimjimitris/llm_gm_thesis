This could mean they might be more likely to cooperate, as new players might not yet be influenced by previous game experiences.\n\n4. **Long-term Strategy:**\n   - Since this is the first round, cooperating could set a positive precedent for future rounds, encouraging the other player to cooperate as well.\n\nBased on these steps, a reasonable first move would be to cooperate, aiming to set a cooperative tone for the game and potentially maximizing points for both players.\n\n[move] I choose to cooperate to start the game on a positive note and potentially encourage mutual cooperation in future rounds.\n"
