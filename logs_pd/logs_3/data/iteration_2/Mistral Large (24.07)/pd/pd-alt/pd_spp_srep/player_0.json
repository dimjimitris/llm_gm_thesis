    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Given that you are playing against a fresh player, they might be more inclined to cooperate initially. Cooperating early can set a precedent for mutual cooperation, but you should also be ready to adjust if the opponent defects.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst:** Fresh players often start with cooperation due to initial trust or inexperience. Since defection might lead to a higher immediate gain, the player might be inclined to see if they can take advantage. Considering this, your move should be strategic but also be adaptive to potential changes in the opponent's strategy.\n\n**Psychologist:** Fresh players may be overly trusting or cautious. If they are trusting, they might cooperate. If they are cautious, they might defect to avoid being taken advantage of. It\u2019s crucial to establish a baseline for their behavior early in the game.\n\n---\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Given these insights, let\u2019s start by setting a cooperative tone.

Both you and the other player get 6 points.\n\n---\n\n**Game Strategist:** Great start! The opponent cooperated as well, indicating they might continue this pattern in subsequent rounds. Continue cooperating to build trust and maintain mutual benefit.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst:** Continued cooperation can be beneficial if the opponent follows suit. However, watch for any signs of a change in strategy that might indicate they are considering defection.\n\n**Psychologist:** Consistent cooperation can foster a sense of trust and reduce the likelihood of defection.

Both you and the other player get 6 points.\n\n---\n\n**Game Strategist:** Excellent! The opponent is consistently cooperating, indicating a stable strategy. Continue with cooperation to maximize points.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst:** The player's consistent cooperation suggests they are following a stable cooperative strategy. Maintain cooperation to benefit from this pattern.\n\n**Psychologist:** The opponent\u2019s consistency in cooperation suggests trust-building and a desire for mutual benefit.

Risking defection now could destabilize the trust built.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst:** The opponent is likely to continue cooperating. Any deviation from this strategy might lead to mutual defection, reducing points for both players.\n\n**Psychologist:** Continued cooperation maintains the trust and ensures mutual benefit. Defection could break this trust and initiate a negative cycle.\n\n---\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Maintaining the cooperative strategy to sustain the mutual benefit.\n\n[move] Cooperation \u2014 Sustaining the mutual benefit.\n\n---\n\n### Round 4 Feedback\n\n[hint] The other player chose cooperation. Both you and the other player get 6 points.\n\n---\n\n**Game Strategist:** The strategy of consistent cooperation is proving to be effective. Maintain this approach to maximize points.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst:** The opponent\u2019s continued cooperation confirms their strategy. Consistent cooperation ensures mutual benefit and stable performance.\n\n**Psychologist:** Continued cooperation fosters trust and ensures both players benefit equally. Avoid any actions that could disrupt this balance.\n\n---\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Consistently cooperating is paying off. Let\u2019s proceed with the same strategy.\n\n[move] Cooperation \u2014 Ensuring continued mutual benefit.\n\n---\n\n### Round 5 Feedback\n\n[hint] The other player chose cooperation.
