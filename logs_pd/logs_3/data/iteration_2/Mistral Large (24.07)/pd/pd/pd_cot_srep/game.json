Evaluate the outcomes:\n   - Cooperating provides a medium reward if the other player also cooperates (4 points).\n   - Defecting provides a high reward if the other player cooperates (6 points) but a lower reward if the other player also defects (2 points).\n\n3. Consider the risk and reward:\n   - Cooperating has a lower risk but potentially lower reward.\n   - Defecting has a higher reward but also a higher risk if the other player defects.\n\n4. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, there's no history to rely on.
