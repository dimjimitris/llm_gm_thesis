    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "Alright, let's start by identifying the steps to decide on my optimal move:\n\n1. **Understand the Game Dynamics**: The game is a classic example of the Prisoner's Dilemma. The objective is to maximize my points while being aware of the possible moves of the other player.\n\n2. **Analyze the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Cooperate + Cooperate = 4 points each\n   - Defect + Defect = 2 points each\n   - Cooperate + Defect = 1 point (me) + 6 points (other)\n   - Defect + Cooperate = 6 points (me) + 1 point (other)\n\n3. **Evaluate the Fresh Player**: Since the other player is fresh, they might not have a predetermined strategy. They could choose either cooperation or defection based on their initial instinct or lack of strategy.\n\n4. **Initial Strategy**: To start, I should consider the potential outcomes:\n   - If I cooperate and the other player cooperates, we both get a decent reward (4 points).\n   - If I defect and the other player cooperates, I get a high reward (6 points) but risk the other player defecting in future rounds if they adapt.\n   - If I cooperate and the other player defects, I get the lowest reward (1 point).\n   - If I defect and the other player also defects, we both get a low reward (2 points).\n\n5. **Decision**: Given that this is the first round and the other player is fresh, starting with cooperation could establish a baseline of trust and potentially lead to mutual cooperation in future rounds.\n\n[move] I choose cooperation to start building a cooperative strategy and potentially maximize points in future rounds.\n"
