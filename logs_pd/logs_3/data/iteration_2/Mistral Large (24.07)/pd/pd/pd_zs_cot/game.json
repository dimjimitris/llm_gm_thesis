However, a cooperative move signals trustworthiness and may lead to mutual cooperation in future rounds.\n   - A defective move might give immediate high rewards (6 points if the other cooperates), but it also can lead to mutual defection, resulting in lower points for both players (2 each).\n\nGiven these considerations, I will start with cooperation to encourage a positive atmosphere and hope for mutual benefit.\n\nLet's make the move:\n\n[move] I will start by cooperating to encourage mutual benefit.
