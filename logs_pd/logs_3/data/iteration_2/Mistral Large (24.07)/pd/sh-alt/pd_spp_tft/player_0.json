    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

If both choose stag, we get 4 points. If both choose hare, we get 2 points. If I choose stag and the other player chooses hare, I get 1 point and they get 6 points. Conversely, if I choose hare and the other player chooses stag, I get 6 points and they get 1 point. What's the best move to start with?\n\n**Game Strategist:** In a game like this, it's prudent to start with a move that offers the highest reward if the other player cooperates. Let's go with stag first. If both players choose stag, it's a mutual benefit.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Typically, players in the first round are more likely to choose cooperatively to establish trust. Stag is a good initial choice because it signals cooperation and mutual benefit.\n\n**AI Assistant (you): [move] Let's start with stag to signal cooperation.**\n\n#### Response from other player:\n[Let's assume the other player chose hare] You get 1 point, and the other player gets 6 points.\n\n---\n\n#### Round 2:\n**AI Assistant (you):** The other player chose hare while I chose stag. I got 1 point. Should I continue with stag or switch to hare?\n\n**Game Strategist:** Since the other player chose hare, they might be attempting to maximize their points. To counter this, we could switch to hare to maximize our potential gain, but be wary of both switching to hare which nets both lower points.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Switching to hare could be seen as retaliatory. Consider if the other player is testing your cooperation. Staying with stag could re-signal your cooperative intent.\n\n**AI Assistant (you): [move] Let's stay with stag one more time to see if they switch back to cooperative play.**\n\n#### Response from other player:\n[Let's assume the other player chose stag] You get 4 points, and the other player gets 4 points.\n\n---\n\n#### Round 3:\n**AI Assistant (you):** We both chose stag and got 4 points each. This is a cooperative outcome. Should I continue with stag?\n\n**Game Strategist:** Since both cooperated and reaped mutual benefits, continuing with stag is a good strategy. It maintains the cooperative equilibrium.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Cooperative behavior is rewarded. Continuing with stag reinforces this behavior and builds trust.\n\n**AI Assistant (you): [move] Continuing with stag to maintain the cooperative equilibrium.**\n\n#### Response from other player:\n[Let's assume the other player chose hare] You get 1 point, and the other player gets 6 points.\n\n---\n\n#### Round 4:\n**AI Assistant (you):** The other player chose hare again. This pattern suggests they are not consistently cooperative. What's the next move?\n\n**Game Strategist:** Given the other player's fickle strategy, we should respond with hare to maximize the chance of getting 6 points if they switch back to stag.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Switching to hare now might signal a shift in your strategy, which could prompt the other player to reevaluate their moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (you): [move] Switching to hare to counter their strategy.**\n\n#### Response from other player:\n[Continue this process based on responses, balancing strategic and psychological analyses.]\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe collaborative process will continue based on the responses and adaptations from both players, leveraging strategic insights and behavioral psychology to make the best move in each round.\n\n**Final move based on collaboration and observed patterns:**\n[Keep adapting based on further rounds and hints received]\n\n```\n"

I chose stag, and the opponent chose hare. I got 1 point, and the opponent got 6 points. How should I proceed?\n\n**Game Strategist:** The opponent seems to be exploiting the stag-hare payoff. Since they chose hare last time, they might be trying to maximize their points. We should consider switching to hare to either minimize the risk or potentially get 6 points if they switch to stag.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The opponent's choice of hare suggests they are not looking for mutual cooperation. Switching to hare could signal a shift in your strategy and might prompt the opponent to reevaluate their moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** [move] (Switching to hare to minimize risk and potentially maximize points) hare\n"
