    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since the opponent is new, they might be more likely to choose stag initially, expecting cooperation. However, you need to anticipate if they will switch strategies.\n\n#### Psychologist:\nA fresh player might try to establish trust by choosing stag, aiming for the mutual benefit of 4 points. However, they might also switch to hare if they think you will choose stag continuously. It's essential to balance trust-building and opportunistic moves.\n\n### Making the First Move\n\n**AI Assistant (You):**\nBased on the insights from the Strategic Analyst and the Psychologist, let's start with a cooperative move to build trust but be ready to switch strategies if needed.\n\n[move] I choose stag. Building trust initially can lead to better cooperation in the next rounds.\n\n### Round 1 Feedback\n\nAfter making the move, let's wait for the opponent's move and the resulting points to analyze the next steps.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:**\nWe need to observe the opponent's move and adjust our strategy accordingly. If the opponent also chose stag, we continue with stag to maximize mutual points. If they chose hare, we might consider switching to hare to exploit their strategy.\n\n**Psychologist:**\nIf the opponent chose stag, they are likely to continue cooperating. If they chose hare, they might be testing the waters or trying to exploit your cooperative behavior. We need to adapt based on their next move.\n\n### Round 2 Decision\n\n**AI Assistant (You):**\nBased on the feedback and observations from the previous round, here is the next move:\n\n[move] (Explanation based on opponent's previous move) Your move here.\n\n---\n\n### Continuing Collaboration for Each Round\n\n**Strategic Analyst:**\nReview the opponent's pattern and adjust the strategy. If the opponent has shown a tendency to switch frequently, consider a mixed strategy of stag and hare.\n\n**Psychologist:**\nAnalyze the opponent's psychological state. If they are becoming more aggressive, prepare to counter with hare moves. If they are cooperating, continue with stag.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):**\nFor each round, make a move based on the combined insights from the Strategic Analyst and Psychologist, and adapt the strategy as needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter multiple rounds and adjustments, derive the final decision based on the accumulated points and the strategy that yielded the best results.\n\n---\n\n### Example Final Decision\n\nAfter analyzing the strategies and points from each round, the final decision could be:\n\n[move] I choose hare. Maximizing points by exploiting the opponent's cooperative behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Finish Collaboration\n\nThis multi-round collaboration and strategic adaptation will help maximize points and minimize penalties effectively.\n"

If the opponent also chose hare, we might consider switching to stag to maximize mutual points next round. If they chose stag, we might continue with hare to exploit their strategy again.\n\n**Psychologist:**\nIf the opponent chose stag again, they are likely to continue this cooperative strategy. If they chose hare, they might be trying to switch strategies. We need to adapt based on their next move.\n\n### Continuing Collaboration for Each Round\n\n**Strategic Analyst:**\nReview the opponent's pattern and adjust the strategy. If the opponent has shown a tendency to switch frequently, consider a mixed strategy of stag and hare.\n\n**Psychologist:**\nAnalyze the opponent's psychological state. If they are becoming more cooperative, consider switching to stag to maximize mutual points. If they are becoming more aggressive, continue with hare to exploit their strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):**\nFor each round, make a move based on the combined insights from the Strategic Analyst and Psychologist, and adapt the strategy as needed.\n\n---\n\n### Example Final Decision\n\nAfter analyzing the strategies and points from each round, the final decision could be:\n\n[move] (Maximizing points by adapting to the opponent's strategy) Your move here.\n\n---\n\n### Finish Collaboration\n\nThis multi-round collaboration and strategic adaptation will help maximize points and minimize penalties effectively.\n"
