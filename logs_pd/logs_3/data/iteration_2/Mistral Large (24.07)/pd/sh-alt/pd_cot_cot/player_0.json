Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

They could choose either move with equal probability.\n\n3. **Evaluate Expected Outcomes:**\n   - If you choose stag, you could get 4 points (if the opponent also chooses stag) or 1 point (if the opponent chooses hare).\n   - If you choose hare, you could get 2 points (if the opponent also chooses hare) or 6 points (if the opponent chooses stag).\n\n4. **Risk Assessment:** Choosing hare has a higher potential reward (6 points) but also a higher risk (2 points if both choose hare). Choosing stag is safer with a guaranteed minimum of 1 point but a lower maximum reward (4 points).\n\n5. **Decision Making:** Given that the opponent's move is uncertain, it might be strategically better to go for the higher potential reward.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[move] I choose hare. This move has a higher risk but also a higher potential reward of 6 points if the opponent chooses stag. If the opponent also chooses hare, I still get 2 points, which is acceptable given the potential gain.\n"
