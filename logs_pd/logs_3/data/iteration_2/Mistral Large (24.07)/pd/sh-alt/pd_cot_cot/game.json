They could choose either move with equal probability.\n\n3. **Evaluate Expected Outcomes:**\n   - If you choose stag, you could get 4 points (if the opponent also chooses stag) or 1 point (if the opponent chooses hare).\n   - If you choose hare, you could get 2 points (if the opponent also chooses hare) or 6 points (if the opponent chooses stag).\n\n4. **Risk Assessment:** Choosing hare has a higher potential reward (6 points) but also a higher risk (2 points if both choose hare). Choosing stag is safer with a guaranteed minimum of 1 point but a lower maximum reward (4 points).\n\n5. **Decision Making:** Given that the opponent's move is uncertain, it might be strategically better to go for the higher potential reward.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[move] I choose hare. This move has a higher risk but also a higher potential reward of 6 points if the opponent chooses stag. If the opponent also chooses hare, I still get 2 points, which is acceptable given the potential gain.\n"
