    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'll choose \"hare\".\n\n**Game Strategy Expert (GSE)**: That's a good start. Choosing \"hare\" can help you understand whether the opponent is aggressive or defensive. It\u2019s a safe initial move because it minimizes potential losses while allowing for a strong return if the opponent chooses \"stag\".\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: [move] (Analysis of first round) Hare\n\nProceeding based on the outcome of the first round:\n\n**[Assuming the outcome is received]**\n\n**Risk Analyst (RA)**: Before making the next move, let's analyze the potential outcomes.

Considering the first round, we might infer the opponent's behavior pattern.\n\n**Game Strategy Expert (GSE)**: Indeed, based on game theory, if the opponent chose \"stag\" in the first round, they might switch to \"hare\" in the second round to maximize their points. If they chose \"hare,\" they might continue with \"hare\" to ensure consistent points.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: [move] (Strategy for the second round) Given the analysis, I'll choose \"stag\". This move has a higher potential reward if the opponent switches to \"hare\". If they choose \"stag\" again, it's a safer balance since both get 4 points.\n\n**[Assuming the outcome is received]**\n\n**Risk Analyst (RA)**: Analyzing the outcomes again, let's consider the probabilities. If the opponent has been switching moves, they might revert to \"stag\" if they chose \"hare\" the last time. This pattern can be exploited by choosing \"hare\" this round.\n\n**Game Strategy Expert (GSE)**: Agreed. Countering their predictable behavior can maximize our points.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: [move] (Adjusting strategy) Hare\n\nContinue this process of collaboration and analysis for each subsequent round, adjusting the strategy based on the opponent's past moves and the insights from the personas.\n\n**Final Collaboration**\n\n**Game Strategy Expert (GSE)**: Reflecting on the series of moves, we should assess the opponent's pattern and tendency to either switch or stay consistent. Use this analysis for the final decision.\n\n**Risk Analyst (RA)**: Consider the risk-reward ratio based on the opponent's past behavior and make a calculated move.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: [move] (Final decision) Based on the analysis and pattern recognition, I'll choose \"stag\" to maximize points if the opponent is likely to choose \"hare\" again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: [move] Stag\n\nBy following this structured collaboration process, we can make informed decisions that maximize points and minimize penalties.\n"
