    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Game Theory Expert\n\n**Begin collaboration!**\n\nAI Assistant (you): Let's start by analyzing the game's rules and payoff matrix. We need to strategize our move to maximize our points and minimize penalties.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Based on the payoff matrix, choosing 'stag' yields higher combined points when both players choose it (4 points each). However, if the other player chooses 'hare,' you get only 1 point, which is a significant loss compared to the potential gain.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The game resembles a classic \"Stag Hunt\" scenario in game theory. In this game, there exists a cooperative equilibrium (both choosing 'stag') and a risk-dominant equilibrium (both choosing 'hare'). The best strategy often depends on your assumption of the other player's choice.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thank you for the insights. If we assume the other player might be inclined towards cooperation, choosing 'stag' could be beneficial. However, if the player is new and might choose 'hare' for a quick gain, choosing 'hare' might be safer.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Given that you are playing against a fresh player, they might not yet understand the optimal strategy. It's a gamble, but choosing 'hare' might hedge against a naive choice.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Considering the payoff matrix and the uncertainty of the opponent's choice, choosing 'hare' in the first round might be a safer bet. You lose less if the other player chooses 'stag' (2 points) compared to the 1 point if you choose 'stag' and they choose 'hare'.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the analysis and considering the fresh player aspect, I will choose 'hare' for the first round to play it safe.\n\n[move] (Choosing 'hare' to minimize risk in the first round) Hare\n\n**Finish collaboration for the first round!**\n\n**Final decision:** Hare\n\nPlease let me know if there are any further hints or if another round begins.\n"

This indicates a cautious approach from both sides, avoiding the risk of choosing 'stag' and getting fewer points if the opponent chose 'hare.'\n\nStrategic Analyst: Given that both players chose 'hare' in the last round, the opponent might continue with this choice to play it safe. However, they might also switch to 'stag' if they think you will choose 'hare' again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" scenario. The choice of 'hare' indicates a preference for a risk-averse strategy. Both players are likely to continue this pattern unless one decides to brave the cooperative strategy of 'stag.'\n\nAI Assistant (you): Should we continue with 'hare' to play it safe or switch to 'stag' to test the waters for cooperation?\n\nStrategic Analyst: Continuing with 'hare' ensures a steady, albeit lower, gain of 2 points if the opponent also chooses 'hare.' Switching to 'stag' is riskier but could yield a higher mutual benefit if the opponent switches as well.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Switching to 'stag' signals a willingness to take a risk for a higher reward. However, it's essential to consider the opponent's mindset. If they continue with 'hare,' you stand to lose points.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the analysis, let's continue with 'hare' for this round to maintain a consistent strategy and avoid significant point losses.\n\n[move] (Choosing 'hare' to maintain a consistent and safe strategy) Hare\n\n**Finish collaboration for this round!**\n\nPlease let me know if there are any further hints or if another round begins.\n\nFinal decision: Hare\n"

However, they might also switch to 'hare' if they anticipate you choosing 'hare' again to maximize their points.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" scenario.

However, if they switch to 'hare,' we only get 1 point while they get 6 points.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Switching to 'stag' can signal a cooperative move and encourage the opponent to continue with 'stag.'
