    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This could be an opportunity to set the tone of the game.\n\n**Analyst:** The payoff matrix shows that choosing hare offers a high reward if the opponent chooses stag, but it's risky. Choosing stag is safer but with lower maximum reward.

We should continue to capitalize on this.\n\n**Analyst:** Choosing hare again would continue to maximize our points. However, consider mixing it up to confuse the opponent.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Consistent exploitation might prompt the opponent to change their strategy. Mixing moves can keep them guessing.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Given the consistent payoff from choosing hare, let's continue exploiting this pattern but stay flexible.\n\n[move] Hare - Continuing to exploit the opponent's conservative strategy, with an eye on future adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### Finish Collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Follow the trend of choosing Hare, anticipating the opponent's conservative strategy, while being prepared to adapt if the opponent changes their strategy.\n\n---\n\nThis multi-round collaboration should help maximize your points and minimize penalties by strategically adapting to the opponent's moves.\n"

Both players choose the same move: stag. You scored 4 points.\n\n**Strategic Planner:** Both players choosing stag indicates a cooperative or conservative strategy from the opponent. We should consider this in our next move.\n\n**Analyst:** The payoff matrix shows that choosing hare offers a high reward if the opponent chooses stag, but it's risky. Choosing stag is safer but with a lower maximum reward. Since the opponent chose stag last time, they might continue this pattern.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Players who choose stag may continue to do so, especially if they perceive it as a safe and cooperative strategy. However, they might switch if they think the strategy is too risky or want to maximize their points.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Thanks for the insights. Given the opponent's previous choice of stag, I'll go with a move to capitalize on their potential conservative strategy.\n\n[move] (Anticipating the opponent to choose stag again for a cooperative outcome) Hare\n"
