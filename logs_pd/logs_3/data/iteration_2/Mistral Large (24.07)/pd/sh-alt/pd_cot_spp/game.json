The key is to coordinate your move with the other player to maximize points. Choosing stag is the optimal strategy if both players can trust each other to cooperate. However, choosing hare is a safer option if you cannot trust the other player.\n\nRisk Analyst: Consider the risk-reward ratio. Choosing stag has a higher reward (4 points) if both players cooperate, but a higher risk (1 point) if the other player chooses hare. Choosing hare has a lower reward (2 points) if both players choose it, but a higher reward (6 points) if the other player chooses stag.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the insights. Given that we are playing against a fresh player, it might be risky to assume cooperation immediately. However, choosing stag could set a cooperative tone for future rounds.

Choosing hare might lead to 6 points if the opponent chooses stag but guarantees only 2 points if the opponent also chooses hare.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: The opponent might continue to choose stag if they sense mutual benefit. However, there's a chance they might switch to hare if they want to exploit the situation.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given the previous round's cooperative outcome, it seems beneficial to maintain this strategy to maximize points and encourage further cooperation.\n\n[move] (Choosing stag to maintain cooperation and potentially maximize points if both players choose stag) stag\n"

  "player_1_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.
