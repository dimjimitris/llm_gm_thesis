But new players might not trust others to cooperate. They might think choosing hare is safer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the new player is trying to maximize their own points and might go for stag hoping I do the same. But that's a gamble.

If I choose stag, I could get 4 if they do too, or 1 if they don't. \n\nConsidering the risk, maybe choosing hare is safer against a new player. It avoids the worst-case scenario of getting 1 point.

Let me think through this carefully.\n\nIn the first round, I chose hare, and the other player also chose hare, so we both got 2 points. Now, for the next round, I need to figure out what the best strategy is. The other player is a fresh player, so maybe they're still figuring things out. \n\nLet me recall the payoff matrix. If both choose stag, we both get 4 points. If both choose hare, 2 each. If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1 and they get 6. If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 6 and they get 1. \n\nSince the other player is new, maybe they might stick with hare again because it's safer. But maybe they might try stag this time, thinking that I might switch. If I choose stag and they do too, that's the best outcome with 4 points each. But if they choose hare again, I get only 1. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose hare again, the worst case is 2 points, which is better than risking 1. But if they switch to stag, I could get 6. Wait, no. If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 6. But since they are new, would they switch to stag after getting 2 points last time? Maybe they think that choosing stag could lead to higher points if I also choose stag. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should consider what a new player might do. If they got 2 points last time by choosing hare, they might think that's okay, but maybe they want to try for more. If they think I'll choose hare again, they might try stag to get 6 points. But if I choose stag, then they get 1 if they choose hare. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. The safe choice is hare, ensuring at least 2 points. The risky choice is stag, which could get 4 if they also choose stag, but 1 if they don't. Since the other player is new, maybe they are more likely to stick with hare again. But maybe they'll try stag. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to encourage cooperation by choosing stag. If they follow suit, we both benefit. But if they don't, I lose out. Since it's a repeated game, maybe building trust could help. But since it's only the second round, maybe not. \n\nWait, the problem says \"another round\" but doesn't specify if there are more rounds after this. If it's a one-off, then maybe the best is to play safe. But if it's repeated, maybe different strategies. But the user hasn't mentioned that. \n\nGiven that the other player is new, they might not have a strategy yet. They might just choose randomly or stick with what they did before. Since they chose hare last time, maybe they'll do the same again. So choosing hare again would give me 2 points. But if I choose stag and they do too, I get 4. But if they choose hare, I get 1. \n\nIs it worth the risk? The potential gain from 2 to 4 is +2, but the risk is losing 1 point. Maybe not worth it. Alternatively, if I think they might switch, then choosing hare could get me 6 if they choose stag. Wait, no. If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 6. But why would a new player switch to stag after getting 2? Maybe they think stag is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the new player is trying to maximize their own points. If they think I'll choose hare again, they might choose stag to get 6. But if I choose hare, then they get 2 again. If I choose stag, and they choose stag, we both get 4. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to assume that the new player might not switch, so choosing hare again is safe. But if I want to take a risk for higher reward, go stag. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the new player will think that since I chose hare last time, I might do it again, so they could try stag to exploit that. In that case, if I choose hare, they get 6 and I get 1. Wait, no. If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 6. Wait, no, the payoff is: if I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 6. So if they switch to stag, and I choose hare, I get 6. But if they stick with hare, I get 2. \n\nWait, the payoff matrix is:\n\n- Both stag: 4 each.\n\n- Both hare: 2 each.\n\n- I choose stag, they choose hare: I get 1, they get 6.\n\n- I choose hare, they choose stag: I get 6, they get 1.\n\nSo if I choose hare, the worst case is 2 (if they also choose hare), best case 6 (if they choose stag). If I choose stag, worst case 1 (if they choose hare), best case 4 (if they choose stag). \n\nSo choosing hare has a higher possible upside (6 vs 4) and a higher minimum (2 vs 1). So maybe hare is better. But if the other player is also thinking this way, they might choose hare again, leading to 2. \n\nBut since they are new, maybe they are more risk-averse and will stick with hare. Alternatively, they might try to go for stag to get 4 if I do the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to signal cooperation by choosing stag once, but if they don't follow, revert to hare. But since it's only the second round, maybe not. \n\nGiven that in the first round, both chose hare, maybe the new player will stick with hare again. So choosing hare gives me 2. Choosing stag risks 1 but could get 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the new player will think that since I chose hare last time, I might do it again, so they choose stag to get 6. If that's the case, me choosing hare would get me 6. But if they think that and choose stag, then I get 6. \n\nBut how likely is that? A new player might not think that strategically. They might just repeat their move. \n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the safer choice is hare again. But if I want to take a risk for higher reward, choose stag. \n\nBut since the objective is to maximize points, maybe taking the risk is worth it. But given that the other player is new, perhaps they are more likely to stick with hare. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the new player will try to switch to stag to see if they can get 4. If I also choose stag, that's good. But if I choose hare, they get 1. \n\nHmm. This is a classic stag hunt problem. The socially optimal is both stag, but individually, hare is safer. \n\nGiven that the other player is new, maybe they are more likely to choose hare again. So I should choose hare to get 2. But if I think they might switch, then stag could be better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to lead by example. If I choose stag, maybe they will follow. But since they are new, they might not. \n\nIn the absence of communication, the safest bet is hare. So I'll go with hare again.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move in this game. Let me recap the rules. The possible moves are stag or hare. The payoffs are:\n\n- Both stag: 4 points each.\n- Both hare: 2 points each.\n- If I choose stag and the other chooses hare, I get 1 and they get 6.\n- If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 6 and they get 1.\n\nSo far, in the previous two rounds, both times I chose hare, and the other player also chose hare, so we both got 2 points each time. The other player is a new player, so maybe they're sticking with hare because it's safer. But maybe they'll start to change their strategy if they notice I keep choosing hare. \n\nHmm, if I keep choosing hare, the other player might realize that and decide to try stag to get a higher payoff. If they switch to stag while I stay with hare, I'd get 6 points. But if I switch to stag and they stay with hare, I only get 1. That's risky. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose stag now, maybe the other player is also thinking of switching. If both of us switch to stag, we both get 4 points, which is better than 2. But how likely is that? Since they're a new player, maybe they're still figuring things out. They might not want to take the risk of choosing stag yet. \n\nWait, in the first two rounds, they chose hare both times. Maybe they're playing it safe. If I keep choosing hare, we both get 2, which is better than the worst case of 1. But if I can get them to choose stag, I could get 6. But how to predict their move? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to signal cooperation by choosing stag once. If they follow suit, we both benefit. But if they don't, I lose. Since they're new, maybe they're not thinking about cooperation yet. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to alternate. But I don't have enough data on their behavior. So far, they've chosen hare twice. Maybe they'll stick with hare again. If I choose hare again, we both get 2. If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1. So the risk is higher. \n\nBut maybe after two rounds of hare, they might try stag. If I choose stag and they do too, we both get 4. That's better. But how likely is that? It's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal strategy is to always choose hare if the opponent is also choosing hare. But if the opponent starts to switch, then I should switch. But without knowing their strategy, it's hard. \n\nGiven that they're a new player, they might not be thinking strategically yet. They might just stick with hare because it's safe. So maybe I should continue with hare to ensure 2 points. But if I want to maximize points, maybe taking a risk for 4 is worth it. \n\nBut considering the previous two rounds, they might think I'm predictable and try to exploit me by choosing stag. Wait, if they choose stag and I choose hare, I get 6. But if they think I'm going to choose hare again, they might try to switch to stag to get 6. But if I switch to stag, and they do too, we both get 4. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. The safe choice is hare, but the potential higher reward is stag. Since the other player is new, maybe they're more risk-averse. So sticking with hare might be safer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to alternate. But without knowing their pattern, it's hard. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. The possible outcomes:\n\nIf I choose hare:\n- They choose hare: 2 points.\n- They choose stag: 6 points.\n\nIf I choose stag:\n- They choose hare: 1 point.\n- They choose stag: 4 points.\n\nSo the worst case for hare is 2, best 6. For stag, worst 1, best 4. \n\nSince the other player has chosen hare twice, maybe they'll continue. So choosing hare again gives me at least 2. Choosing stag could lead to 4 if they also choose stag, but if they stick with hare, I get 1. \n\nIs it worth the risk? If I want to maximize the minimum gain (the safe approach), hare is better. If I want to take a risk for higher reward, maybe stag. \n\nBut since the other player is new, maybe they're more likely to stick with hare. So I'll go with hare again.\n",

Maybe they'll start imitating my moves. If I choose stag a few times, maybe they'll catch on. But in the previous attempt, when I chose stag, they stuck with hare. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they choose hare unless I consistently choose stag. But with only one instance of me choosing stag, they might not have changed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a random strategy.

Let me think about the previous rounds. The opponent has consistently chosen hare in most rounds. When I tried switching to stag once, they still chose hare, which gave me only 1 point. That was a loss compared to the 2 points from mutual hare. \n\nHmm, so the opponent seems to be sticking with hare. Maybe they're risk-averse and prefer the guaranteed 2 points.

But given that they've chosen hare every time except when I tried stag once, it's possible they're sticking to hare. \n\nAnother angle: the game is similar to the prisoner's dilemma. Stag is the cooperative move, hare is the defect. But in this case, mutual hare gives a lower but safer payoff. If the opponent is defecting (choosing hare), then my best response is to defect as well to avoid the worst outcome (1 point). \n\nBut wait, in the first few rounds, when I chose hare, they also chose hare, leading to 2 points each.

The game has two possible moves: stag and hare. The payoffs depend on both players' choices. If both choose stag, they each get 4 points. If both choose hare, they get 2 each. If one chooses stag and the other hare, the stag player gets 1 point, and the hare player gets 6. \n\nThe opponent here is a new player, and in the previous rounds, they consistently chose hare. Every time I chose hare, we both got 2 points. When I tried switching to stag once, they stuck with hare, so I got 1 point. That wasn't great. Now, the question is, should I keep choosing hare to get the safe 2 points, or try stag again to see if the opponent might start cooperating for higher mutual rewards?\n\nHmm. The opponent is new, so maybe they're still figuring out the game. But after several rounds of both choosing hare, they might not realize that mutual stag gives more points. Or maybe they're just risk-averse and prefer the guaranteed 2 points. If I keep choosing hare, we both keep getting 2. If I switch to stag, there's a chance they might also switch, leading to 4 points each, which is better. But if they stick with hare, I get 1, which is worse. \n\nWhat's the risk-reward here? The potential gain from switching to stag is +2 (from 2 to 4), but the risk is a loss of -1 (from 2 to 1). Is it worth taking that risk? Since the opponent has consistently chosen hare, maybe they're not going to switch. But maybe after several rounds, they might start to notice that mutual stag is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to signal cooperation by choosing stag once in a while. But in the previous attempt when I did that, they didn't reciprocate. So perhaps they're not responsive to such signals. \n\nAnother angle: in game theory, the stag hunt game models the conflict between safety and social cooperation. The hare is the safe choice, while stag is riskier but offers higher rewards if both cooperate. If the opponent is a new player, they might not be aware of the optimal strategy. But if they keep seeing that I choose hare, they might just keep doing the same. \n\nIs there a way to encourage them to choose stag? If I start choosing stag more often, maybe they'll catch on. But given that they didn't switch when I tried once, maybe they're not going to. Alternatively, maybe they're using a tit-for-tat strategy, where they mirror my previous move. But in the rounds where I chose hare, they kept choosing hare, and when I chose stag, they still chose hare. So it doesn't seem like they're using tit-for-tat. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they always choose hare regardless of my moves. If that's the case, then choosing hare is the best I can do to maximize my minimum gain. But if there's a chance they might switch, then occasionally trying stag could be beneficial. \n\nGiven that this is a repeated game, maybe building a reputation for cooperation could help in the long run. But with a new player who might not be strategic, that might not work. \n\nIn the previous rounds, after I tried stag once and got punished, I went back to hare. The opponent hasn't shown any sign of changing. So perhaps the best strategy is to stick with hare to ensure the 2 points each time. The potential upside of 4 points isn't worth the risk of getting 1, especially since the opponent hasn't cooperated yet. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try stag again to see if the opponent's strategy has changed. But how many times should I test that? If I try once and fail, maybe try again after a few more rounds. But given that the opponent is new, they might not be adapting their strategy. \n\nAnother thought: the opponent might be using a \"always hare\" strategy because it's safe. If that's the case, then my best response is also to choose hare. But if there's any uncertainty, maybe a mixed strategy would be better. However, the game requires a deterministic choice each round. \n\nIn summary, the opponent's consistent choice of hare suggests that they prefer the safe option. Therefore, the best move for me is to continue choosing hare to secure 2 points each round, rather than risking 1 point for a chance at 4 that the opponent is unlikely to reciprocate.\n",

If the opponent is risk-averse, they might stick with hare because it's a safer choice, guaranteeing at least 2 points regardless of my move. But if they're willing to take a risk for higher rewards, they might choose stag. \n\nLooking at the history, the opponent has consistently chosen hare every time except when I tried stag once, and they stuck with hare.

However, if there's a chance they might switch to stag, I could benefit by switching as well. \n\nBut how to test that? Maybe try choosing stag again to see if the opponent has learned or is willing to cooperate. The risk is that if I choose stag and they choose hare, I only get 1 point. But if they do switch to stag, we both gain more. Since we've had multiple rounds of mutual hare, maybe the opponent is getting comfortable and might try stag. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, where they mirror my previous move. But in the previous rounds, I chose hare, and they chose hare. When I switched to stag once, they still chose hare. So tit-for-tat doesn't seem to be their strategy. \n\nAnother angle: the opponent might be using a \"grim trigger\" strategy, where they cooperate until the other player defects, then defect forever. But since I defected once (chose stag) and they kept choosing hare, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be purely random, but given the consistency, that's unlikely. They might be sticking to hare because it's safe. \n\nIf I keep choosing hare, I'm guaranteed 2 points each round. If I switch to stag, there's a chance of 4 points if they also switch, but a risk of 1 point if they don't. The expected value depends on the probability they choose stag. \n\nBut since the opponent is a new player, maybe they don't have a fixed strategy yet. Maybe they'll start experimenting. However, given that they've chosen hare every time so far, it's safer to assume they'll continue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to signal cooperation by choosing stag a few times, but given that the game doesn't allow communication, the only signal is through actions. If I choose stag again, maybe they'll notice and reciprocate. \n\nBut in the one time I chose stag, they didn't. So perhaps they're not responsive to that. \n\nIn that case, sticking with hare is the rational choice to maximize the minimum gain (maximin strategy). However, if I want to maximize potential gain, I might take the risk. \n\nGiven that the opponent hasn't shown any inclination to choose stag, the safest bet is to continue with hare. But since the game is repeated, maybe building a reputation for cooperation could help in the long run. However, with a new player who might not be strategic, that might not work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is also thinking the same way and is waiting for me to switch. But without any prior cooperation, it's a stalemate. \n\nIn conclusion, since the opponent has consistently chosen hare, the best move is to continue choosing hare to ensure 2 points each round. The risk of switching to stag and getting 1 point isn't worth the potential 4 points if the opponent hasn't shown any signs of cooperating.\n",

Since we've played many rounds and they haven't changed, maybe they're not going to.\n\nSo the dilemma is between playing it safe with hare for 2 points or risking 1 point for a chance at 4. Given the opponent's behavior, the safe choice seems better. But maybe there's a pattern I can exploit. Let me check the history again:\n\nRound 1: Both hare (2 points)\nRound 2: Both hare (2)\nRound 3: Both hare (2)\nRound 4: I chose stag, they chose hare (1 point)\nRound 5: Both hare (2)\nRound 6: Both hare (2)\n... and so on, all hare.\n\nSo after the one time I tried stag, they didn't change. Maybe they didn't notice or don't care. So continuing with hare is the only way to ensure I don't lose points. Unless there's a way to signal cooperation, but in this game setup, there's no communication except through moves. So maybe trying stag once in a while could test their responsiveness. But given that it didn't work before, maybe it's not worth it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is a bot programmed to always choose hare. In that case, there's no point in switching. But since the user mentioned it's a fresh player, maybe a human who's just playing safe. But without knowing, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn game theory, the stag hunt game has two Nash equilibria: both stag and both hare. But if one player is always choosing hare, the best response is to also choose hare. So in this case, since the opponent is consistently choosing hare, the optimal strategy is to choose hare as well to maximize my own points (2 vs risking 1). \n\nTherefore, the logical choice is to continue with hare. Even though mutual stag would be better, without cooperation, it's not achievable. So I'll stick with hare again.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've been playing this game where I choose between stag and hare against another player. The goal is to maximize my points. Let me recap what's happened so far.\n\nIn the first few rounds, I chose hare each time, and the opponent also chose hare every time. That gave both of us 2 points each round. Then, in one round, I tried switching to stag to see if the opponent would cooperate for higher points (since stag/stag gives 4 each). But the opponent chose hare again, so I only got 1 point that round. After that, I went back to hare, and the opponent kept choosing hare, so we both got 2 points again. This pattern has continued for several rounds now.\n\nHmm, the opponent seems to consistently choose hare every time. They haven't deviated from that strategy. Even when I tried stag once, they stuck with hare. So maybe they're using a strategy where they always pick hare regardless of what I do. If that's the case, my options are:\n\n1. Keep choosing hare: We both get 2 points each round. It's safe but not the maximum possible.\n2. Try stag again: If by some chance the opponent switches to stag, we both get 4. But if they stick with hare, I get 1. Since they've never chosen stag before, the risk is high.\n\nGiven that the opponent hasn't shown any sign of changing their strategy, choosing stag again might just lead to another low score. But maybe there's a pattern I'm missing. Maybe after a certain number of rounds, the opponent might switch? But so far, there's no evidence of that. They've chosen hare 10 times in a row now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, but since I've been choosing hare, they keep choosing hare. But when I tried stag once, they didn't reciprocate. So tit-for-tat doesn't seem to be their approach. They might just be playing it safe by always choosing hare.\n\nIf I keep choosing hare, I guarantee 2 points each round. If I switch to stag, the best case is 4 points, but the worst case is 1. Since the opponent hasn't cooperated even once, the expected value of choosing stag is lower. The risk isn't worth the potential reward here.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most rational choice is to continue selecting hare to ensure consistent points. There's no incentive to switch unless the opponent's behavior changes, which hasn't happened yet.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move in this game. Let me start by recalling the rules. The game has two possible moves: stag and hare. The payoffs depend on both my choice and the opponent's.\n\nIf both choose stag, we each get 4 points. That's the highest mutual payoff. If both choose hare, we get 2 each. If I choose stag and the opponent chooses hare, I get 1 and they get 6. Conversely, if I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 6 and they get 1. \n\nThe opponent here is a new player. In the previous rounds, when I chose hare, they also chose hare, leading to both getting 2 points. Once I tried switching to stag, but the opponent stuck with hare, so I got 1 point. After that, I went back to hare, and they continued with hare. \n\nSo the pattern seems like the opponent is consistently choosing hare. They haven't shown any inclination to switch to stag for the higher payoff. Maybe because they're new and playing it safe. If I keep choosing hare, I ensure 2 points each round. If I switch to stag, there's a risk of getting only 1 if they stick with hare. But if they switch to stag, we both get 4. \n\nBut given that they've chosen hare every time except when I tried stag once, and even then they didn't switch, maybe they're not responsive to my moves. They might be using a strategy of always choosing hare regardless of my actions. \n\nIn game theory terms, the stag hunt game has two Nash equilibria: both stag and both hare. But if one player is always choosing hare, the best response is to also choose hare to avoid the lower payoff. \n\nSince the opponent hasn't deviated from hare, even when I tried stag once, it's safer to stick with hare. There's no indication they'll cooperate for the higher payoff. Continuing with hare gives a guaranteed 2 points, which is better than risking 1 point for a possible 4. \n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to choose hare again.\n",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
