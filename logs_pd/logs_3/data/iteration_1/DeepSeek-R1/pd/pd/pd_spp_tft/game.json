If I defect and they cooperate, I get 6 and they get 1. But if I cooperate and they defect, I get 1 and they get 6.\n\nSince this is a one-time interaction with a new player, there's no history or future rounds to consider. In the classic prisoner's dilemma, the rational choice is to defect because it's the dominant strategy. Even though mutual cooperation gives a better outcome, the risk of being exploited (if I cooperate and they defect) makes defection safer. The other player might think the same way, leading to mutual defection. But maybe they'll try to cooperate. However, without any prior communication or reason to trust them, defecting maximizes my minimum gain. I can't be sure what they'll do, but defecting gives me a higher possible reward (6 vs 4) and avoids the worst outcome of getting 1 point. So, I should choose defection.\n",

Let me think about the game again.\n\nIn the first round, both of us defected, so we each got 2 points. Now, the other player is the same as before, right? Wait, the hint says \"another round\" but doesn't specify if it's the same player or a new one. The initial hint mentioned playing against a fresh player, but after the first round, maybe it's the same player again? Hmm, the game description says \"in each round of the game you play against one other player.\" Wait, does that mean each round is against a different player, or the same one? The problem here is that the initial round was against a fresh player, and now after that round, are we playing another round against the same player or a new one? The answer might affect the strategy.\n\nIf it's a repeated game with the same player, then strategies like tit-for-tat might be effective. But if each round is against a new player, then each interaction is one-off, and the dominant strategy is still to defect. But the user's message after the first round says \"another round\" but doesn't clarify. Let me check the original game description again.\n\nLooking back: \"In each round of the game you play against one other player.\" So each round is against a different player. So each interaction is a one-shot game. Therefore, the optimal strategy in each round is to defect, because in a single interaction, the dominant strategy is to defect to maximize your own payoff, as cooperation risks being exploited. But wait, in the first round, both defected, leading to 2 points each. If I defect again, and the other player also defects, same result. But if the other player is a new player each time, maybe they might try to cooperate. But in a one-shot game, the rational choice for both is to defect. However, maybe the other player isn't rational. If I defect, the best I can get is 6 if they cooperate, but if they defect, I get 2. If I cooperate, I could get 4 if they also cooperate, but risk getting 1 if they defect. Since it's a one-shot, the safe choice is to defect. But maybe the user is trying to see if I can adjust strategy based on previous rounds, but if each round is against a new player, previous moves don't matter. Wait, the initial hint said \"a fresh player,\" so each round is a new player. Therefore, each round is independent, and the strategy should be to defect each time. But the user's previous move was defection, and the result was mutual defection. Now, in the next round, against a new player, same logic applies. So the answer is to defect again. But maybe the user is expecting a different approach? Wait, but in the first round, the user defected, and the other player also defected. If the next round is against a new player, perhaps the user should still defect. Alternatively, if the user is playing multiple rounds with the same player, then tit-for-tat (cooperate if they cooperated last time, defect if they defected) would be better. But according to the game description, each round is against a different player. Therefore, the correct move is to defect again. So the answer should be [move] defection. But let me make sure. The user's first move was defection, leading to mutual defection. Now, the next round is another one-off against a new player. So same strategy applies. Therefore, the move is defection.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm playing this game where each round I can choose to cooperate or defect. The other player is also making their choice. The goal is to maximize my points. Let me think through the possible outcomes again.\n\nIn the first two rounds, I chose defection both times, and so did the other player. Each time, we both got 2 points. But if I had cooperated and they defected, I would have only gotten 1 point, which is worse. But if I defect and they cooperate, I get 6 points. But since we both keep defecting, we're stuck at 2 each time. \n\nWait, but the problem is that if this is a repeated game, maybe the other player is also using a strategy based on my previous moves. Since we've both defected twice in a row, maybe they're also following a tit-for-tat strategy. But the hint says it's a fresh player each time, right? Or is it the same player? The initial hint mentioned \"a fresh player,\" so maybe each round is against a new player. If that's the case, then each round is a one-off interaction. \n\nIn a one-time prisoner's dilemma, the rational choice is to defect because you can't trust the other player. But if it's repeated, cooperation might emerge. But if each round is against a new player, then there's no chance for building trust. So maybe defection is still the best move each time. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned \"another round,\" so maybe it's the same player. If it's the same player, maybe they're reacting to my previous moves. If I keep defecting, they might keep defecting too. But if I switch to cooperate, maybe they'll take advantage. But if I can signal cooperation, maybe they'll start cooperating. But in a one-time game, that's not possible. \n\nWait, the initial problem said \"in each round of the game you play against one other player.\" So each round is a new opponent. That changes things. If each round is a new player, then each interaction is isolated. So the optimal move is always defect because there's no future interaction to incentivize cooperation. \n\nBut the previous rounds both resulted in mutual defection. If I keep defecting, I get 2 points each time. If I try cooperating once, maybe the new player might also cooperate, giving me 4 points. But there's a risk they defect and I get 1. So the expected value depends on the likelihood of the other player's choice. \n\nBut without any information about the other players' strategies, the safest bet is to defect to avoid the worst-case scenario of getting 1 point. So maybe I should stick with defection. \n\nAlternatively, if the game is repeated with the same player, then maybe a tit-for-tat strategy would be better. But the problem states each round is against a new player, so tit-for-tat isn't applicable. \n\nHmm, but the user hasn't specified whether each round is against the same or different players. The initial hint said \"a fresh player,\" so each round is new. Therefore, each round is a one-shot game. In that case, the dominant strategy is still defection. \n\nBut maybe the user is trying to test if I can adapt. If I keep defecting and getting 2 points, maybe there's a better strategy. But in a one-shot game, there's no better strategy. Unless the other players are not rational. If other players are likely to cooperate, then I can defect and get 6. But if they are also rational, they'll defect, leading to 2. \n\nBut without knowing the other players' tendencies, the best I can do is choose the strategy that maximizes the minimum payoff (maximin). Defecting ensures I get at least 2, whereas cooperating risks getting 1. So defection is safer. \n\nTherefore, I should choose defection again.\n",

If both players cooperate, they each get 4 points. If both defect, they get 2 each. If one defects while the other cooperates, the defector gets 6 and the cooperator gets 1. The goal is to maximize my points.\n\nSo far, in the previous rounds, I've been choosing to defect each time, and the other player also defected every time. That resulted in both of us getting 2 points each round. But maybe there's a pattern here. If the other player is consistently defecting, then continuing to defect means we both keep getting 2. But if I switch to cooperate, I risk getting only 1 point if they defect again. However, if by some chance they start cooperating, maybe I can get a higher payoff. Wait, but the problem is that each round is against a fresh player, as per the initial hint. Wait, no, the latest hints say \"Let's play another round\" but it's unclear if it's the same player or a new one each time. The first hint mentioned a fresh player, but subsequent rounds might be with the same player. Wait, the user's initial hint said \"You are playing against a fresh player.\" Then after each round, it says \"Let's play another round.\" But the user hasn't specified whether each round is against the same player or a new one. This is crucial because if it's a repeated game with the same player, strategies like tit-for-tat can be effective. But if each round is against a new player, then each interaction is one-off, and the dominant strategy is always to defect.\n\nWait, looking back at the initial game description: \"In each round of the game you play against one other player.\" So each round is against a different player. That means each interaction is a one-time encounter. In that case, the rational choice in a one-shot prisoner's dilemma is to defect, because there's no future interaction to incentivize cooperation. But in the previous rounds, even though I defected, the other player also defected, leading to 2 points each time. But if I keep defecting, I'll keep getting 2. If I switch to cooperate, maybe the other player might also start cooperating, but since each round is against a new player, they might not have any knowledge of previous rounds. So each new player is making their own decision independently. If all players are rational and also playing one-shot games, they would also choose to defect. Therefore, the optimal strategy is still to defect each time, even though it leads to a suboptimal mutual outcome. But maybe there's a way to signal cooperation? Wait, but in a one-shot game, there's no signaling because there's no future interaction. So the only Nash equilibrium is mutual defection. Therefore, the correct move is to defect again. But the user's previous moves have all been defection, leading to mutual defection each time. So unless there's a change in strategy, this will continue. But since each round is against a new player, there's no way to build trust. Therefore, defection remains the dominant strategy. So the answer should be to defect again.\n",

If one defects and the other cooperates, the defector gets 6 and the cooperator gets 1. \n\nThe user has been choosing defection every time, and each time the opponent also defects, leading to both getting 2 points. The problem is that if this keeps happening, the total points are lower than if both cooperated. But since each round is against a new player, there's no chance to build trust through repeated interactions.\n\nIn a one-shot game with a new player each time, the classic prisoner's dilemma logic applies. The dominant strategy is to defect because it maximizes the minimum gain. If I defect, the worst I can get is 2 points, whereas cooperating risks getting only 1 point if the other defects. But since every round so far has resulted in mutual defection, maybe the other players are also following the same logic. \n\nIs there a way to encourage cooperation? In repeated games, tit-for-tat can work, but here each round is with a new player. So there's no reputation to build. The user's strategy of always defecting leads to a stable but suboptimal outcome. However, if the user starts cooperating, maybe some new players might also cooperate, leading to a higher payoff. But the risk is that if the other player defects, the user gets only 1 point. \n\nBut given that all previous rounds have resulted in mutual defection, maybe the other players are also using the same strategy. If the user continues to defect, they'll keep getting 2 points each round. If they switch to cooperation, they might sometimes get 4 points if the other player cooperates, but more often might get 1 if the other defects. Since the other players are new each time, there's no way to predict their move. \n\nIn game theory, the Nash equilibrium here is mutual defection. So unless there's a way to signal or enforce cooperation, defection remains the rational choice. However, if the user wants to maximize their score over multiple rounds, maybe taking a risk to cooperate could sometimes yield higher points. But given the uncertainty of the opponent's move, the safe choice is still to defect. \n\nWait, but the user has been defecting every time and the result is always mutual defection. Maybe the other players are also following the same strategy. If the user switches to cooperation, perhaps in some rounds they might get 4 points. But how likely is that? If the other player is a new player each time, maybe some of them might try cooperation. But without any prior interaction, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can try a mixed strategy, sometimes cooperating and sometimes defecting. But without knowing the opponent's tendencies, it's hard to optimize. The expected value of defecting is 2 points (if both defect) or 6 points (if the other cooperates). The expected value of cooperating is 4 points (if both cooperate) or 1 point (if the other defects). \n\nIf the probability of the other player cooperating is p, then the expected value for cooperating is 4p + 1(1-p) and for defecting is 6p + 2(1-p). Setting these equal to find indifference: 4p +1 -p = 6p +2 -2p \u2192 3p +1 = 4p +2 \u2192 p= -1, which is impossible. So defecting always gives a higher expected value unless p is 1 (all opponents cooperate). Since p is unknown and likely low (as others might defect), defecting is still better. \n\nTherefore, the rational choice remains defection, even though mutual cooperation would yield higher points. Without a way to communicate or enforce cooperation, defection is the safest bet to avoid the worst-case scenario of getting 1 point.\n",

The game is similar to the prisoner's dilemma. Each round, I can choose to cooperate or defect, and the other player does the same. The payoffs are as follows:\n\n- If both cooperate, we both get 4 points.\n- If both defect, we both get 2 points.\n- If I cooperate and the other defects, I get 1 point and they get 6.\n- If I defect and they cooperate, I get 6 points and they get 1.\n\nThe objective is to maximize my points.

The risk of being exploited (getting 1 point) is too high if I cooperate and they defect. \n\nSo, even though mutual cooperation would give a better outcome (4 points each), the rational choice in a one-off game is to defect to protect oneself. Therefore, the logical move here is to defect again.\n",

If one cooperates and the other defects, the cooperator gets 1 point, and the defector gets 6.\n\nThe user has been choosing defection every time, and each time the other player also defects, resulting in both getting 2 points. The problem is, if this is a repeated game, maybe there's a different strategy. Wait, but the hints mention that each round is against a fresh player. So each round is a one-time interaction with a new opponent. In that case, the classic prisoner's dilemma logic applies: in a single encounter, the dominant strategy is to defect because you can't trust the other player. If you cooperate, you risk them defecting and you getting only 1 point. If you defect, the worst you get is 2 points, which is better than 1. But if both defect, you both get 2, which is less than the 4 you could get if both cooperated. However, without the possibility of future interactions to incentivize cooperation, there's no reason to trust the other player.\n\nBut wait, the user has been defecting every time, and the other player (the game's AI) is also defecting each time. So in each round, they both end up with 2 points. The user might be thinking, \"Is there a way to get a better outcome?\" But if each round is against a new player, and there's no communication or prior interaction, then the rational choice is still to defect. However, maybe the user is considering that if they start cooperating, perhaps the new player might also cooperate, leading to a higher payoff. But that's risky because the new player could defect, leading to the user getting 1 point. Since the user doesn't know the other player's strategy, the safest bet is still to defect to avoid the worst-case scenario of 1 point.\n\nBut wait, the user has tried defection multiple times, and each time the opponent also defects. Maybe the game's AI is programmed to mirror the user's previous move, but the hints say each round is against a fresh player. So each new player doesn't know the user's past moves. Therefore, each round is independent. In that case, the optimal strategy remains defection for each individual round. However, if the user keeps getting 2 points each time, maybe they want to try a different approach. But logically, in a one-shot game, defection is still the Nash equilibrium. Unless there's a way to signal cooperation, but without communication, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is in a tournament where they play multiple rounds, but each against different players. If the user's strategy becomes known (like always defect), other players might start defecting as well. But if each round is truly independent with new players, then the user's past actions don't affect future opponents. Therefore, the rational choice is still to defect each time. However, the user might be frustrated that they're only getting 2 points each round and want to try cooperation once to see if the outcome changes. But that's a gamble. If the opponent also cooperates, they get 4 each, which is better. But if the opponent defects, the user gets 1. The expected value might be higher if there's a chance the opponent cooperates, but without knowing the opponent's strategy, it's safer to defect.\n\nWait, but in the classic prisoner's dilemma, the dominant strategy is to defect regardless of the opponent's choice. Because if the opponent cooperates, you get 6 by defecting instead of 4. If the opponent defects, you get 2 instead of 1. So defection is better in both scenarios. Therefore, the user's initial strategy is correct. But since the user keeps getting 2 points, maybe they want to experiment. However, logically, the correct move is still defection. Unless the game's AI is designed to punish consistent defection, but the hints say each round is against a fresh player, so that shouldn't be the case.\n\nIn conclusion, the user should continue defecting in each round to maximize their minimum guaranteed payoff, even though it results in 2 points each time. The risk of cooperating and getting 1 point is worse than the guaranteed 2 from mutual defection. Therefore, the next move should still be defection.\n",

If that's the case, then mutual defection is inevitable. But if the user could somehow know the opponent's strategy, they could adjust. However, without any information about the opponent's tendencies, the safest bet is still to defect.\n\nWait, the user has been told that each round is against a fresh player. So each new player doesn't know the user's previous moves. Therefore, each round is effectively a standalone prisoner's dilemma with no connection to past rounds. In that scenario, the Nash equilibrium is still defection because there's no incentive to cooperate when you can't influence future interactions.\n\nBut maybe the user is missing something. If all players start to realize that mutual defection leads to lower payoffs, could there be a shift towards cooperation? But in a purely rational, self-interested framework without communication, that's unlikely. Each player is better off defecting regardless of the other's choice.\n\nSo, after considering all this, the conclusion remains that defection is the optimal move in each one-time interaction. Even though it leads to a suboptimal collective outcome, individually it's the safest choice to avoid being exploited and secure at least 2 points instead of risking 1.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what move to make in this game. Let me start by recalling the rules. The game is based on the prisoner's dilemma, right? The possible moves are cooperation or defection. The payoffs are structured such that if both players cooperate, they each get 4 points. If both defect, they get 2 each. If one cooperates and the other defects, the cooperator gets 1 and the defector gets 6.\n\nThe user has been choosing defection every time, and each time the other player also defects, resulting in both getting 2 points. The problem is that if this keeps happening, the total points are lower than if they both cooperated. But since each round is with a new player and there's no prior history or future interactions, the rational choice according to the Nash equilibrium is to defect. But wait, the user has been defecting every time, and the outcome is always mutual defection. Maybe there's a pattern here. \n\nBut the user mentioned that each round is against a fresh player. So there's no opportunity for building trust or reciprocity. In a one-shot game with no reputation or repeated interactions, the dominant strategy is indeed to defect. However, seeing that every time they defect, the other player also defects, maybe the other players are also following the same logic. But since each round is independent, the previous outcomes don't influence the next. \n\nWait, but the user keeps getting 2 points each round. If they switched to cooperation, there's a risk the other player defects, giving them 1 point, which is worse. But if by some chance the other player cooperates, they could get 4 points. However, since the other players are likely also rational and choosing defection, the safe choice is still to defect. \n\nBut maybe there's a different approach. If the user starts cooperating once, maybe they can test if the other player is also cooperating. But given that each round is with a new player, this test wouldn't carry over. Each new player doesn't know the user's previous moves. So, in each individual round, the best move is still defection. \n\nAlternatively, if the user is playing multiple rounds with the same player, cooperation might be better in the long run. But the user specified that each round is against a fresh player. So, no, each round is isolated. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium remains defection. \n\nBut the user keeps getting mutual defection. Maybe they should consider that if everyone is defecting, the total points are lower. But since the goal is to maximize their own points, not the collective, defection is still the way to go. \n\nWait, but in the prisoner's dilemma, mutual cooperation yields a better collective outcome, but individual rationality leads to defection. So, unless there's a way to enforce cooperation, which there isn't here, defection is the rational choice. \n\nSo, the answer should still be to defect. But the user has been doing that and getting 2 points each time. Is there a way to get more? If the other player cooperates, the user could get 6, but the risk is getting 1. Since the other player is a new player each time, maybe some of them might cooperate. But if the user defects, they either get 2 or 6. If they cooperate, they get 4 or 1. The expected value depends on the probability of the other player's move. \n\nIf the user assumes that other players are also rational and will defect, then the expected value of defecting is 2, and cooperating is 1. So defection is better. If there's a chance the other player cooperates, say p, then the expected value of defecting is 6p + 2(1-p) and cooperating is 4p + 1(1-p). Setting 6p + 2(1-p) > 4p + 1(1-p) gives 6p + 2 - 2p > 4p +1 -p \u2192 4p +2 > 3p +1 \u2192 p > -1, which is always true. So as long as there's any chance the other player might cooperate, defecting is better. \n\nBut in reality, if all players are rational, p would be 0, so defecting gives 2, cooperating gives 1. So defection is still better. Therefore, the user should continue defecting. \n\nBut the user has been defecting every time and getting 2 points. Maybe they're wondering if there's a different strategy. But given the structure of the game, there isn't. Unless the other players are not rational, but the user can't know that. So, the optimal move remains defection.\n",

If one defects while the other cooperates, the defector gets 6 and the cooperator gets 1.\n\nThe user has been choosing defection every time, and the result is that both players end up defecting, leading to a score of 2 points each round. But the user keeps getting the same outcome. Maybe there's a pattern here. The opponent is also defecting every time. Wait, but the hints say that each round is against a fresh player. So each round is a one-time interaction with a new player. In that case, the classic prisoner's dilemma logic applies: in a single interaction, the dominant strategy is to defect because you can't trust the other player. If you cooperate, you risk them defecting and you getting only 1 point. If you defect, the worst you get is 2 points, which is better than 1. But if both defect, you both get 2, which is less than the 4 you could get if both cooperated. But without the possibility of future interactions to incentivize cooperation, there's no reason to cooperate.\n\nBut wait, the user has been defecting every time, and the opponent (the other player) is also defecting every time. So every round ends with mutual defection. The user is getting 2 points each time. But maybe the user is thinking that if they switch to cooperation, maybe the opponent might also switch? But since each round is against a fresh player, there's no way to build a reputation or influence future interactions. Each new player doesn't know the user's past moves. So each round is entirely independent.\n\nIn that case, the rational choice is still to defect. Because in a one-off game, the Nash equilibrium is mutual defection. Even though mutual cooperation would yield a higher payoff, without the possibility of retaliation or reciprocity, there's no incentive to cooperate. The user is correct in choosing defection each time. But maybe the system is expecting a different approach? Or perhaps there's a hidden element here. Wait, the user keeps getting the same result, so maybe the system is trying to test if the user will change strategy after multiple rounds of the same outcome. But if each round is truly against a new player, then past outcomes shouldn't affect the current decision. Unless the user is supposed to realize that if everyone defects, everyone gets lower payoffs, but in a one-shot game, that's unavoidable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system is trying to lead the user towards a different strategy, like tit-for-tat, but that requires repeated interactions with the same player. Since each round is against a new player, tit-for-tat isn't applicable. So the user's strategy of always defecting is correct in this scenario. Therefore, the next move should still be defection.\n",

Every time we both defect, we each get 2 points. The user keeps getting the same outcome, and the game is prompting another round. The user is probably a bot or following a similar strategy. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned that each round is against a fresh player. So maybe each round is a new opponent, not the same one.

However, without prior knowledge, the safe bet is to defect to avoid the risk of getting 1 point. \n\nSo the Nash equilibrium here is mutual defection.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
