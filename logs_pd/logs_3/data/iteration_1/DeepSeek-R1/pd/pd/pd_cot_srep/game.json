I'm playing against a new player, and we each have to choose between cooperation and defection. The payoffs are structured such that mutual cooperation gives both 4 points, mutual defection gives 2 each. If one defects while the other cooperates, the defector gets 6 and the cooperator gets 1.\n\nSince this is a one-time interaction with a new player, there's no history or future rounds to consider. The other player might not know my strategy, and I don't know theirs. In game theory, the rational choice in a single-shot prisoner's dilemma is usually to defect because it maximizes the potential payoff regardless of the other's choice. If I defect, the worst I can get is 2 points if they also defect, but if they cooperate, I get 6. If I cooperate, I risk getting only 1 point if they defect. So, defecting seems safer and offers a higher possible reward. However, if both cooperate, we both get 4, which is better than mutual defection. But without any assurance that the other will cooperate, defection is the dominant strategy here.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I just played a round where both of us defected, and we each got 2 points. Now, the next round is starting. Let me think about what to do this time.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the payoff structure. If we both cooperate, we get 4 each. If both defect, 2 each. If I cooperate and they defect, I get 1 and they get 6. If I defect and they cooperate, I get 6 and they get 1. \n\nIn the first round, I chose defection because it was a one-time game with a new player. The logic was that defecting either gives me 6 if they cooperate or 2 if they also defect, which is better than risking getting 1 if I cooperate and they defect. But now, after the first round, maybe the other player's strategy could change based on what happened before. Wait, but the hint says \"another round\"\u2014does that mean this is a repeated game now? Or is each round a separate one-time interaction? The initial problem said \"in each round of the game you play against one other player,\" so maybe each round is against a different player. But the current hint says \"another round,\" so perhaps it's the same player again. That's a bit confusing. \n\nIf it's a repeated game with the same player, then building trust could lead to mutual cooperation for higher payoffs. But if it's a new player each round, then each round is independent. The first hint mentioned \"a fresh player,\" so maybe each round is against a new player. But the current hint says \"another round\" after the previous one ended, so maybe it's the same player. Hmm. The user hasn't clarified whether this is a repeated game or a series of one-shot games. \n\nAssuming it's another one-shot game with a new player, the same logic as before might apply. But maybe the other player learned from the previous round. Wait, no\u2014if each round is against a different player, then the previous outcome doesn't affect the current one. But if it's the same player, then they might be retaliating. \n\nWait, the first round was against a fresh player, and now the user says \"another round.\" The initial problem didn't specify if it's a repeated game or multiple one-shot games. Since the first round was with a new player, maybe this next round is also with a new player. So each round is independent. \n\nIn that case, the same reasoning applies: in a one-shot game, the dominant strategy is to defect because it maximizes the minimum payoff. Cooperating risks getting 1 point if the other defects, while defecting guarantees at least 2, with a chance of 6 if they cooperate. \n\nBut maybe there's a different angle. If the other player is also a rational agent, they might think the same way and defect, leading to mutual defection. But if there's a chance they might cooperate, defecting gives a higher payoff. \n\nAlternatively, if the game is repeated, then strategies like tit-for-tat (cooperate first, then mirror the opponent's previous move) can be effective. But since the user hasn't indicated that this is a repeated interaction with the same player, I should assume it's another one-shot game. \n\nTherefore, the rational choice is still to defect. However, in the first round, both defected, leading to 2 points each. If I switch to cooperate this time, maybe the other player will too, leading to 4 each. But that's risky because if they defect, I get 1. \n\nBut since it's a new player each time, there's no history. So each round is independent. The optimal strategy in a one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma is to defect. So I should defect again. \n\nWait, but maybe the other player in this new round is also a new player who might have a different strategy. If they are more cooperative, I could exploit them by defecting. If they are also defecting, I get 2. If I cooperate and they defect, I get 1. So defecting is safer and has a higher possible reward. \n\nTherefore, the best move is to defect again.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what move to make in this next round. Let me recap the game rules to make sure I understand them correctly.\n\nThe game is a variation of the prisoner's dilemma. If both players cooperate, they each get 4 points. If both defect, they get 2 each. If one defects while the other cooperates, the defector gets 6 and the cooperator gets 1. The goal is to maximize my own points.\n\nSo far, in the previous two rounds, I chose defection both times, and so did the other player. That resulted in both of us getting 2 points each time. The problem here is that mutual defection leads to a lower payoff than mutual cooperation. But since this is a one-time interaction each round with a new player, there's no opportunity to build trust or establish a pattern of cooperation.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"another round\" each time. However, the initial hint said \"You are playing against a fresh player\" each time. So each round is a separate interaction with a new player, not repeated with the same one. That's important because in repeated games, strategies like tit-for-tat can work, but in one-shot games, the rational choice is typically to defect to avoid being exploited.\n\nBut in the first two rounds, when I defected, the other player also defected. That suggests that maybe the other players are also using a similar strategy, expecting defection. But if everyone defects, we all end up with 2 points, which is worse than the 4 points from mutual cooperation. However, the risk of cooperating is that if the other player defects, I get only 1 point, which is worse than 2.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a different approach. If I start cooperating, maybe some players will also cooperate, leading to a higher payoff. But since each round is against a new player, there's no way to influence their decision based on past interactions. So each round is independent.\n\nIn game theory, the Nash equilibrium for a one-shot prisoner's dilemma is mutual defection because regardless of the other's choice, defecting gives a higher individual payoff. If the other cooperates, I get 6 instead of 4. If the other defects, I get 2 instead of 1. So rationally, defection is better. But this leads to a suboptimal outcome for both.\n\nHowever, if there's a chance that the other player might cooperate, maybe I should take that risk. But how likely is that? If the other player is also a rational agent, they'll defect. But if they're not (maybe they're naive or altruistic), cooperating could yield a better result.\n\nBut the problem is that the user hasn't given any information about the other player's tendencies. The first two times, the other player defected. Maybe all players are programmed to defect, or maybe they're following the same logic. If that's the case, continuing to defect will keep getting 2 points. But if I switch to cooperate, and the other player defects, I get 1, which is worse. So the safe choice is still defection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other players are adjusting their strategy based on previous rounds. But the user said each round is against a fresh player, so previous moves don't affect the current one. Therefore, each decision should be made independently.\n\nSo, considering all this, the rational choice remains defection to maximize the minimum payoff (avoiding the worst-case scenario of 1 point) even though mutual cooperation would be better collectively. But since there's no communication or repeated interaction, defection is the dominant strategy.\n",

The game is based on cooperation and defection. If both players cooperate, they each get 4 points. If both defect, they get 2 each. If one cooperates and the other defects, the cooperator gets 1 point and the defector gets 6. \n\nSo far, in the previous rounds, both of us have chosen defection each time, resulting in 2 points each. The other player seems to be sticking with defection as well. Since this is a repeated interaction now, maybe the strategy should change? Wait, but the user mentioned \"another round\" but didn't specify if it's a repeated game or still one-off. The initial hint said \"playing against a fresh player,\" but now after several rounds, maybe the same player is continuing?\n\nIf it's a repeated game, the optimal strategy might be different. In repeated interactions, cooperation can be beneficial because of the possibility of reciprocal behavior. But if each round is against a new player, then defection might still be the best choice. However, the user hasn't clarified whether each round is with the same player or a new one. The initial hint said \"a fresh player,\" but subsequent rounds might be with the same one. \n\nWait, looking back, the first hint said \"You are playing against a fresh player.\" Then after each round, the message says \"Let's play another round.\" It's possible that each round is a new game with a new player. If that's the case, then each interaction is one-off, and the best move is still defection because there's no future interaction to incentivize cooperation. \n\nBut in the previous rounds, the opponent also defected each time. If it's the same player, maybe they are using a tit-for-tat strategy, where they mirror your previous move. But since all previous moves were defection, they might continue to defect. However, if I switch to cooperation, maybe they'll take advantage again. But if it's a new player each time, then their move isn't influenced by past interactions. \n\nAlternatively, if the game is iterated with the same player, then building trust could lead to mutual cooperation. But given the initial setup, it's unclear. The user hasn't specified, but the initial hint mentioned a fresh player, so perhaps each round is a new opponent. \n\nIn a one-shot game, the Nash equilibrium is mutual defection because defecting is the dominant strategy. However, if there's a chance of repeated interaction, cooperation can emerge. But without knowing the number of rounds, it's safer to defect. \n\nGiven that the previous rounds resulted in mutual defection and the same outcome each time, maybe the opponent is also using a strategy of always defecting. If I continue to defect, I'll keep getting 2 points. If I try cooperating once, I risk getting 1 point if they defect again, but if they also switch to cooperate, we both get 4. But since in a one-off game, the rational choice is to defect, and if each round is independent, then sticking with defection is safer. \n\nHowever, the user hasn't clarified if the rounds are with the same player. If they are, maybe a tit-for-tat approach would be better. But given the initial information, it's safer to assume each round is a new player, so defection remains the optimal choice to avoid exploitation and secure at least 2 points. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be defection again.\n",

That's really bad for me. On the flip side, if I defect and they cooperate, I get 6 points. If we both defect, we each get 2. \n\nSince each round is against a new player, there's no chance to build trust or retaliate. The previous rounds all ended with both of us defecting and getting 2 points. But maybe the other player is starting to catch on? Wait, no, each round is a new player, so they don't know my past moves. \n\nBut if every time I defect, the other player might also be thinking the same way. So we both end up with 2 points. But if I try cooperating once, maybe the new player might also cooperate, giving us both 4 points. But there's a risk they defect and I get 1. \n\nBut since it's a one-time interaction, the rational choice from game theory is still to defect, right? Because defecting guarantees at least 2 points, whereas cooperating risks getting only 1. Even though mutual cooperation is better, without any way to communicate or enforce trust, defection is the safer bet. \n\nWait, but maybe if I keep defecting every time, all new players will also defect, leading to the same 2 points each round. But if I switch to cooperation, maybe some players will also cooperate, leading to higher points. But how likely is that? Since they're new each time, they might have different strategies. Some might try cooperating, others defect. \n\nBut without any information about the other player's tendencies, the safest move is still defection. Because the worst-case scenario with defection is 2 points, whereas cooperating could lead to 1. So even though mutual cooperation is better, the risk of being exploited makes defection the dominant strategy here. \n\nSo I should stick with defection again. Even though it's leading to 2 points each time, it's better than risking 1 point. Unless there's a way to signal cooperation, but since it's a one-off, there's no way to do that.

If both players cooperate, they each get 4 points. If both defect, they get 2 each. If one defects while the other cooperates, the defector gets 6 and the cooperator gets 1. \n\nThe user has been choosing defection every time, and each time the opponent also defected, leading to 2 points each round. The problem here is that mutual defection gives a lower payoff than mutual cooperation. But since this is a one-time interaction each round with a new player, there's no opportunity to build trust or retaliate in future rounds.\n\nIn a single round with no prior interactions, the dominant strategy in game theory for the prisoner's dilemma is to defect. This is because, regardless of what the other player does, defecting either gives a higher payoff (if they cooperate) or avoids the worst outcome (if they defect). If I cooperate, the best I can hope for is 4 points if they also cooperate, but I risk getting only 1 if they defect. If I defect, the worst I get is 2 points, which is better than 1, and the best is 6. \n\nBut wait, the user has been defecting every time, and the opponent is also a new player each round. If all new players are also following the same logic (defect), then mutual defection is the result. But maybe there's a chance that some players might try cooperation, especially if they're hoping for mutual benefit. However, without any communication or prior interaction, it's risky to switch to cooperation now. \n\nIs there any reason to change strategy? If the user keeps defecting, they'll keep getting 2 points each round. If they switch to cooperation, maybe once in a while, they might hit a cooperative opponent and get 4 points. But the risk is getting 1 point, which is worse. Since each round is independent, there's no learning or adaptation from previous rounds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent's behavior could be influenced by the user's past moves, but the hint says each round is against a fresh player. So previous moves don't affect the current opponent. Therefore, each round is a completely new game with no history. \n\nIn that case, the rational choice remains defection. Even though mutual cooperation is better, without any way to signal or enforce cooperation, defecting is the safest bet to avoid the worst outcome. The user's strategy so far has been consistent with this logic, leading to 2 points each time. \n\nBut perhaps the user is wondering if there's a better approach. Maybe if they start cooperating, they might encourage the opponent to cooperate in future rounds. But since each round is against a new player, this doesn't apply. Each new player doesn't know the user's previous moves. \n\nSo, sticking with defection is the optimal strategy in this scenario. The user might be frustrated with the low payoff of 2 each time, but switching to cooperation could lead to even lower payoffs if the opponent defects. The game's structure inherently punishes unilateral cooperation. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is to continue defecting in each round to secure at least 2 points, avoiding the risk of getting 1 point if the opponent defects. There's no incentive to cooperate in a one-shot game with a stranger.\n",

The other player is also making a choice, and the points depend on both our moves. Let me think through this again.\n\nIn the previous rounds, every time I chose defection, the other player also chose defection. That resulted in both of us getting 2 points each. But if I had chosen cooperation, maybe things would be different? Wait, but the problem is that if I cooperate and the other player defects, I only get 1 point while they get 6. That's a big risk. Since these are one-time interactions with new players each time, there's no way to build trust or establish a pattern. \n\nThe first time, I thought defection was the safest bet because it avoids the worst-case scenario of getting 1 point. Even though mutual cooperation gives 4 points each, which is better, the risk of the other player defecting and me getting screwed over is too high. Especially since I don't know anything about the other player's strategy. They might be thinking the same way as me, leading to mutual defection every time. \n\nBut wait, maybe if I try cooperating once, just to see what happens. If the other player also cooperates, we both get 4 points, which is better than 2. But how likely is that? If they're a new player each time, maybe some of them might try cooperating. But if they're rational, they might also choose defection to protect themselves. It's a classic prisoner's dilemma. \n\nIn a single round game, the Nash equilibrium is mutual defection because no player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other's remains unchanged. So rationally, defection is the dominant strategy. But maybe there's a different approach if the game is repeated, but the user said each round is against a fresh player, so there's no repetition with the same opponent. \n\nSo sticking with defection seems logical. Even though mutual cooperation is better, the risk of being exploited is too great. By defecting, I ensure I get at least 2 points, and if the other player by some chance cooperates, I get 6. But in all previous rounds, the other player also defected. Maybe all players are using the same strategy. \n\nAlternatively, if I start cooperating, maybe some players will reciprocate, but without any prior interaction, it's a gamble. Since the goal is to maximize my points, maybe the safe choice is still defection. But I'm consistently getting 2 points each time. If I could get 4 points by cooperating, that's better. But how to signal cooperation without being taken advantage of? \n\nHmm. Maybe in a one-shot game with no communication, the only safe move is defection. There's no way to enforce cooperation, so the rational choice is to defect. Even though it leads to a suboptimal outcome, it's the best individual strategy. \n\nSo, I think I'll stick with defection again. The potential gain from mutual cooperation isn't worth the risk of getting 1 point. Plus, the other player's likely thinking the same way, leading to mutual defection. So, defection it is.\n",

But in a one-shot game, there's no incentive for the other player to cooperate because they can maximize their gain by defecting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other player is using a tit-for-tat strategy, but since each round is against a new player, that's not possible. So in each new round, the other player has no history with me. Therefore, their decision is based solely on their own strategy. \n\nIf I assume that other players are rational and also trying to maximize their points, they might also choose defection for the same reasons I did. But if everyone defects, we all get stuck in a suboptimal outcome. However, if I take a risk and cooperate, maybe some players will too, leading to a higher payoff. \n\nBut the problem is that in a single round with no prior interaction, the dominant strategy is still to defect.

But according to the game theory, unless there's a possibility of future interactions, cooperation isn't rational. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"another round\" each time. Are these rounds part of a repeated game with the same player or new players each time? The initial hint said \"playing against a fresh player,\" so each round is a new opponent. Therefore, each round is a one-shot game. \n\nIn that case, the optimal move is still defection. Because there's no way to build trust or punish/reward past behavior. So even though mutual cooperation gives a higher payoff, the risk of being exploited (getting 1 point) makes defection the safer choice. \n\nBut maybe the user is trying to test if I'll ever change strategies. If I keep defecting, I'll keep getting 2 points. If I try cooperating once, maybe the other player (if they're not a bot) might also cooperate.

So, sticking with defection is the rational choice here. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be to defect again, even though it leads to the same outcome.

The problem is that if this continues, they'll keep getting 2 points each round. But if they could somehow coordinate to cooperate, they'd both get 4 points, which is better. However, the challenge is that without communication or prior agreement, it's risky to switch to cooperation because the other player might still defect, leading to a worse outcome for the user (1 point instead of 2).\n\nThe user's previous reasoning is that in a one-off game, defection is safer. But since this is now multiple rounds, even though each round is against a new player, maybe there's a different approach. Wait, no\u2014each round is against a fresh player, so there's no history or reputation to build. Each interaction is isolated. That means each round is effectively a one-time game. So the same logic applies: defection is the dominant strategy because it maximizes the minimum gain (2 points) and avoids the risk of getting 1 point if the other player defects when you cooperate.\n\nBut let me double-check the payoffs. If I defect and the other player cooperates, I get 6 points. If I cooperate and they defect, I get 1. If both cooperate, 4 each. Both defect, 2 each. So the best outcome for me individually is to defect when the other cooperates. The worst outcome is cooperating when they defect. Since there's no way to know what the other player will do, especially in a one-time game, the safest bet is to defect to ensure I don't get the worst payoff. \n\nEven though mutual cooperation gives a better collective result, without any assurance that the other player will cooperate, it's too risky. The Nash equilibrium here is both players defecting, which is why the user keeps ending up there. So unless there's a way to signal cooperation or establish trust, which there isn't in this setup, defection remains the rational choice.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the user is trying to see if the opponent will ever switch. But since each round is against a new player, there's no learning or adaptation happening. Each new player doesn't know the history of previous rounds. So each round is independent. Therefore, the strategy shouldn't change based on past rounds because each opponent is different and unaware of prior interactions.\n\nIn conclusion, sticking with defection is still the best move here. It ensures a minimum of 2 points and avoids the risk of getting only 1. Even though mutual cooperation would be better, without any mechanism to encourage it, defection is the only safe choice.\n",

If both players cooperate, they each get 4 points. If both defect, they get 2 each. If one defects and the other cooperates, the defector gets 6 and the cooperator gets 1. \n\nThe user has been choosing defection every time, and the opponent (which is probably another instance of the same logic) is also defecting each time. So every round ends with both defecting and getting 2 points each. But the user keeps getting 2 points each round, which is better than the 1 they'd get if they cooperated and the opponent defected.\n\nBut wait, in the classic prisoner's dilemma, the rational choice in a single round is to defect because it's the dominant strategy. But here, since the user is playing multiple rounds with the same opponent, maybe there's a chance to build trust? Wait, no, the hints say \"Let's play another round\" but it's unclear if it's the same opponent each time. The initial hint mentioned \"a fresh player\" each time, so maybe each round is against a new player. If that's the case, then each round is a one-off interaction with no future consequences. In that scenario, the Nash equilibrium is still to defect because there's no way to punish or reward future behavior. \n\nBut the user has been defecting every time, and the opponent (if it's a new player each time) is also defecting. So the user is stuck at 2 points each round. If they tried cooperating once, maybe the opponent (if it's a new player) might also cooperate, leading to 4 points. But the risk is that the opponent defects, giving the user 1 point. Since the user is risk-averse, they might prefer the guaranteed 2 over the risk of 1. \n\nBut maybe the opponent's strategy is also to defect every time, so changing to cooperation would just result in lower points. However, if the opponent is a new player each time, perhaps some of them might cooperate. But without any information about the opponent's tendencies, the safest bet is still to defect. \n\nWait, but the user has been defecting every time, and the result is always mutual defection. If the user wants to maximize their points, maybe they should try cooperating once to see if the opponent does the same. But in a one-shot game with a new player, the opponent's best response is to defect, so cooperating would lead to a lower payoff. \n\nAlternatively, if the game is actually a repeated game with the same opponent, then the strategy might change. But the hints suggest each round is against a fresh player, so it's a series of one-shot games. In that case, defection is still the dominant strategy. \n\nSo the conclusion is to keep defecting to ensure at least 2 points each round, avoiding the risk of getting 1 point if the opponent defects. Even though mutual cooperation would yield higher points, without the possibility of building trust over multiple interactions, it's too risky. Therefore, the optimal move remains defection.\n",

If one cooperates and the other defects, the cooperator gets 1 point and the defector gets 6. \n\nThe user has been choosing defection every time, and each time both players end up defecting, resulting in 2 points each. The problem is, if this keeps happening, we're both stuck at 2 points per round. But the best outcome for both would be mutual cooperation, giving 4 points each. However, the risk is that if I switch to cooperation and the other player defects, I get only 1 point. \n\nSince the user mentioned that each round is against a fresh player, there's no history or future interactions. In game theory, the Nash equilibrium for a single-round Prisoner's Dilemma is mutual defection because there's no incentive to cooperate without the possibility of future retaliation. But maybe the other player is also following the same logic, leading to endless mutual defection.\n\nWait, but the user has been told that each round is against a new player. So there's no way to build trust over multiple rounds. If every interaction is one-off, then the rational choice is still defection. But maybe if I try cooperating once, just to see if the other player might also switch. But given that each round is a new player, the other player's strategy isn't influenced by previous rounds. So if I cooperate, the new player might defect, leading me to get 1 point. That's worse than the 2 points from mutual defection. \n\nAlternatively, if I keep defecting, the worst I get is 2 points, which is better than the 1 point risk. So maybe sticking with defection is safer. But the user has been defecting every time, and the result is always mutual defection. Maybe the system is designed to mirror the user's move? But the user is told that they're playing against fresh players each time. \n\nHmm, but if all players are using the same strategy (always defect), then mutual defection is inevitable. But if there's a chance that a new player might cooperate, then defecting gives a higher payoff (6 vs 4). But the problem is, without any information about the other player's tendencies, the safest bet is to defect. \n\nWait, but in the initial rounds, the user chose defection, and the other player also defected. So maybe the other players are also programmed to defect. If that's the case, then mutual defection is the only outcome. But the user's goal is to maximize points. If mutual cooperation gives 4, which is better than 2, but the risk is too high. \n\nIs there a way to signal cooperation without risking too much? But in a one-shot game, there's no signaling. So the rational choice remains defection. Therefore, the user should continue defecting to avoid the risk of getting 1 point. \n\nBut maybe the system is trying to test if the user will ever switch strategies. However, given the structure of the game, unless there's a change in the rules or the possibility of repeated interactions, defection is still the dominant strategy. \n\nSo, the conclusion is to keep choosing defection to secure the 2 points, avoiding the risk of getting 1 point if the other player defects. Even though mutual cooperation is better, without any way to enforce or encourage it, defection is the safer choice.\n",

The user keeps choosing defection, and I've been doing the same. But maybe there's a pattern here. Wait, the hints mention that each round is against a fresh player. Oh, right! Each round is a one-time interaction with a new player. That changes things.\n\nIn a one-time prisoner's dilemma with a new player each time, the rational choice is usually to defect because there's no future interaction to incentivize cooperation.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
