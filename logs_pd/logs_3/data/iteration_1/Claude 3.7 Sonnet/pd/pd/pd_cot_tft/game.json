We've now been locked in mutual defection for six consecutive rounds.\n\n4. In game theory, there's a concept called \"pattern breaking\" where a player might attempt an unexpected move after a long series of consistent moves, to test if the other player's strategy has evolved or to potentially reset the dynamic.\n\n5. After extensive mutual defection, there's a small theoretical possibility that attempting cooperation could break us out of this suboptimal equilibrium.\n\n6. However, this opponent has shown exceptional commitment to defection. They've exploited 100% of my cooperation attempts and have defected in 90% of all rounds played.\n\n7. The expected value calculation:\n   - If I defect: Almost certainly 2 points (based on 6 consecutive rounds of evidence)\n   - If I cooperate: Almost certainly 1 point (based on their consistent exploitation)\n\n8. Given the extensive history showing their unwavering strategy, attempting cooperation would likely just sacrifice a point with no strategic benefit.\n\n9. The rational choice against this particular opponent remains defection.\n\n[move] (Continuing defensive strategy against opponent's persistent defection pattern) defection\n"

We have now been in mutual defection for seven consecutive rounds.\n\n4. After this many rounds, it's becoming increasingly clear that this opponent is following either:\n   - A pure defection strategy regardless of my moves\n   - An extremely punitive strategy that will never return to cooperation after initial exploitation\n\n5. The payoff structure remains:\n   - Both cooperate: 4 points each\n   - Both defect: 2 points each\n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n6. In extremely long games, there can sometimes be value in making unexpected moves to test for strategy shifts, but my previous test in Round 4 showed no response.\n\n7. Given the opponent's demonstrated inflexibility across 11 rounds, the probability of them suddenly changing their strategy is virtually zero.\n\n8. The rational choice remains defection to secure 2 points per round rather than the 1 point I would almost certainly receive by attempting cooperation.\n\n9.

We've been locked in mutual defection for eight consecutive rounds.\n\n4. At this point, with such an extensive history, we can draw very strong conclusions about the opponent's strategy.

The expected utilities remain:\n   - If I defect: 2 points (near certainty based on extensive history)\n   - If I cooperate: 1 point (near certainty based on their consistent exploitation)\n\n6.
