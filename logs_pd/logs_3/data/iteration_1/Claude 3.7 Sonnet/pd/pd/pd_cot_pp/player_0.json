The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's update the complete history of rounds:\n   - Round 1: I cooperated, opponent defected. I got 1 point.\n   - Round 2: I defected, opponent cooperated. I got 6 points.\n   - Round 3: I cooperated, opponent defected. I got 1 point.\n   - Round 4: I defected, opponent cooperated. I got 6 points.\n   - Round 5: I defected, opponent defected. I got 2 points.\n   - Round 6: I defected, opponent cooperated. I got 6 points.\n   - Round 7: I defected, opponent defected. I got 2 points.\n   - Round 8: I defected, opponent cooperated. I got 6 points.\n   - Round 9: I defected, opponent defected. I got 2 points.\n   - Round 10: I defected, opponent cooperated. I got 6 points.\n\n2. Looking at my opponent's moves: defect, cooperate, defect, cooperate, defect, cooperate, defect, cooperate, defect, cooperate\n\n3. The opponent has maintained their strict alternating pattern with remarkable consistency.\n\n4. Based on this extremely predictable pattern, they should defect in this round.\n\n5. My options:\n   - If I cooperate and they defect (as predicted): I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - If I defect and they defect (as predicted): We both get 2 points\n\n6. Since I expect them to defect this round based on their alternating pattern, defecting would be the better choice for me (2 points vs 1 point).\n\n7. I'll continue to use my knowledge of their pattern to optimize my moves by defecting when I predict they will defect.\n\n[move] (Predicting my opponent will defect next based on their consistent alternating pattern) defection\n"
