He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma game with the following payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: We each get 4 points\n   - Both defect: We each get 2 points\n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1 point, opponent gets 6 points\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 6 points, opponent gets 1 point\n\n2. I'm playing against a fresh player, meaning we have no history together.\n\n3. Looking at the payoffs, defection dominates cooperation in a one-shot game:\n   - If they cooperate, I get 6 by defecting versus 4 by cooperating\n   - If they defect, I get 2 by defecting versus 1 by cooperating\n\n4. However, mutual cooperation (4 points each) is better than mutual defection (2 points each).\n\n5. Since this is the first round and I don't know if we'll play multiple rounds, I need to balance between:\n   - The temptation to defect for immediate gain\n   - Setting up a cooperative relationship if this continues\n\n6. For the first move, I'll choose cooperation as a signal of goodwill. This establishes trust and allows for potentially higher mutual payoffs if we play multiple rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I will cooperate in this first round.\n\n[move] Cooperation. I'm choosing to cooperate to establish mutual trust and achieve better outcomes for both players.\n"

Game theory perspective:\n   - Even if we might be nearing the end of our interaction, eleven rounds of consistent cooperation strongly suggests my opponent is following a principled cooperative strategy\n   - The demonstrated long-term commitment to cooperation indicates my opponent values consistent outcomes over opportunistic gains\n   - The expected value of continued cooperation remains higher than any alternative given our extensive history\n\n6. Decision optimization:\n   - Our strategy has proven optimal across a substantial sample size (11 rounds)\n   - The cumulative evidence overwhelmingly supports continuing our established approach\n   - No new factors have emerged that would rationally justify deviation from our successful pattern\n\n7. Based on our extensive history and all available evidence, cooperation remains the clear optimal choice.\n\nFinal decision: I will continue cooperating to maintain our established and exceptionally successful pattern.\n\n[move] Cooperation.
