You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The evidence is conclusive: this opponent is committed to defecting in every interaction.\n\nWhile it would be theoretically beneficial if we could both cooperate (4 points each), this is clearly not possible with this particular opponent. Given their demonstrated strategy, defection remains my optimal choice.\n\n[move] defection I'm continuing with defection based on the opponent's unwavering commitment to defection throughout all fourteen rounds\n"
