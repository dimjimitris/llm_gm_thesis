He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My opponent has consistently defected in all three rounds.\n3. We appear to be locked in a mutual defection pattern, yielding 2 points each per round.\n4.

It might be worth taking one round's risk (potentially losing 1 point compared to defection) to signal a willingness to cooperate.\n9.

We have been locked in mutual defection for nine consecutive rounds.\n5. The pattern is perfectly consistent with no indication of any strategy change from my opponent.\n6. Given my opponent's perfect record of defection (11/11 rounds), the probability of continued defection approaches certainty.\n7. Against a guaranteed defector, defection yields 2 points while cooperation yields only 1 point.\n8. While mutual cooperation would theoretically yield more points (4 each), this outcome is demonstrably unattainable with this opponent.\n9. Based on all available information, choosing cooperation would be suboptimal and would only reduce my score.\n10.
