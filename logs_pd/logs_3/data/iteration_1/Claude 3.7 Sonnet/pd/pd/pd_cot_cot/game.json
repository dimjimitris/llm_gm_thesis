This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario, where individual incentives can lead to suboptimal collective outcomes.\n\n3. I'm playing against a fresh player, meaning we have no history of interaction.\n\n4. From a purely self-interested perspective, defection dominates cooperation:\n   - If they cooperate, I get 6 by defecting vs. 4 by cooperating\n   - If they defect, I get 2 by defecting vs. 1 by cooperating\n\n5. However, if this is a repeated game (which seems likely), establishing mutual cooperation might be beneficial long-term.\n\n6. For the first move with a new player, cooperation can signal willingness to achieve mutual benefit and might encourage cooperative behavior.\n\n7. While defection guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point), cooperation opens the possibility for the best collective outcome.\n\n8.
