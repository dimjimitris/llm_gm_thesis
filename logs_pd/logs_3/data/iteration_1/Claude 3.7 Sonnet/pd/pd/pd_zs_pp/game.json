Instead, they've consistently defected whenever I cooperate after they cooperate. Here's the updated history:\n\n- Round 1: I cooperated, they defected (I got 1)\n- Round 2: I defected, they cooperated (I got 6)\n- Round 3: I cooperated, they defected (I got 1)\n- Round 4: I defected, they cooperated (I got 6)\n- Round 5: I defected, they defected (I got 2)\n- Round 6: I cooperated, they cooperated (I got 4)\n- Round 7: I cooperated, they defected (I got 1)\n- Round 8: I defected, they cooperated (I got 6)\n- Round 9: I cooperated, they defected (I got 1)\n- Round 10: I defected, they cooperated (I got 6)\n- Round 11: I defected, they defected (I got 2)\n- Round 12: I cooperated, they cooperated (I got 4)\n- Round 13: I cooperated, they defected (I got 1)\n- Round 14: I defected, they cooperated (I got 6)\n- Round 15: I cooperated, they defected (I got 1)\n\nThe clearest pattern is that my opponent almost always cooperates after I defect (rounds 2, 4, 8, 10, 14). Given this consistent pattern and the fact that they've defected 5 out of 6 times when I cooperate, the optimal strategy is to defect again.\n\n[move] (Following the established pattern to maximize points) defection\n"
