In many successful iterative game strategies (like Tit-for-Tat with forgiveness), occasionally returning to cooperation after mutual defection can break negative cycles\n8. Since we're in a cycle of mutual defection (2 points each), which is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (4 points each), it may be worth the risk to attempt cooperation again\n9.

Game theory perspective:\n   - Against a pure defector strategy, the optimal response is defection\n   - We are in a stable Nash equilibrium of mutual defection\n   - While suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation, this equilibrium is the best possible outcome given my opponent's committed strategy\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - With 11 rounds of clear evidence, the rational choice remains defection\n\n[move] Defection. My opponent has consistently defected for ten consecutive rounds, showing an unwavering commitment to this strategy. Defection remains my optimal move to secure 2 points rather than the 1 point I would receive if I cooperated.\n"
