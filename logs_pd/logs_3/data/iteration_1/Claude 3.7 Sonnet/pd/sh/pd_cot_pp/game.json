This is a classic \"stag hunt\" game with the following payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - One chooses stag, one chooses hare: The stag hunter gets 1 point, the hare hunter gets 4 points\n\n2. Let me analyze the strategic considerations:\n   - Stag has the highest mutual payoff (6 points each) but requires coordination\n   - Hare is safer - guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 4 points\n   - If I expect the other player to choose stag, I should choose stag (6 > 4)\n   - If I expect the other player to choose hare, I should choose hare (2 > 1)\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player:\n   - There's no history to base decisions on\n   - The payoff structure incentivizes coordination on stag for maximum mutual benefit\n   - Many players would recognize this and aim for the optimal cooperative outcome\n   - However, there's risk involved with choosing stag\n\n4. Given it's the first round, I'll choose stag as an initial cooperative move:\n   - It signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n   - It opens the possibility for the highest payoff (6 points)\n   - If the other player also recognizes this optimal strategy, we both benefit\n\n[move] stag - I'll choose stag as the optimal cooperative strategy that maximizes potential mutual benefit.\n"

This suggests several possibilities about my opponent:\n   - They might be playing cautiously by choosing the safer option\n   - They might be strategically exploiting cooperative players\n   - They might not understand the optimal cooperative strategy\n\n3. Looking at my options now:\n   - If I choose stag again and they keep choosing hare, I'll get 1 point again\n   - If I choose hare and they keep choosing hare, I'll get 2 points\n   - If I choose hare and they switch to stag, I'll get 4 points\n\n4. Given the opponent's history of choosing hare:\n   - The rational response is to adapt and match their strategy\n   - Choosing hare guarantees me at least 2 points instead of 1\n   - This also prevents them from exploiting my cooperation again\n\n5. For this round, I'll choose hare:\n   - It minimizes my risk (floor of 2 points vs. 1 point)\n   - It's more likely to maximize my score against this particular opponent\n   - It signals that I won't continue to be exploited\n\n[move] hare - Adapting to my opponent's previous behavior to secure a better outcome for myself.\n"

Let me review the game history so far:\n   - Round 1: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1 point, they got 4 points\n   - Round 2: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 4 points, they got 1 point\n\n2. Our pattern suggests we might be in a cycle:\n   - When I play stag, they play hare\n   - When I play hare, they play stag\n   - This could indicate they're either trying to exploit me or they're responding to my previous moves\n\n3. If this pattern continues:\n   - If I choose stag now, they might choose hare again \u2192 I'd get 1 point\n   - If I choose hare now, they might choose stag again \u2192 I'd get 4 points\n\n4. Alternative hypothesis: they might be trying to establish cooperation:\n   - Their stag play in round 2 could be signaling a desire to coordinate on stag-stag\n   - If we both play stag, we both get 6 points, which is optimal for collective outcome\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If opponent is predictably alternating, I should play hare (expected 4 points vs 1 point)\n   - If opponent is attempting to establish cooperation, I should play stag (potential 6 points)\n   - Given the limited information, I have to weigh risk vs. reward\n\n6. Decision calculation:\n   - Based on the observed pattern, playing hare seems safer with higher expected value\n   - However, missing an opportunity for stag-stag coordination has opportunity cost\n   - Since this is potentially an iterated game, signaling cooperation might be valuable\n\n7. For this round, I'll choose hare:\n   - The pattern suggests my opponent might play stag again\n   - Getting 4 points is better than risking only 1 point if they play hare\n   - If they're trying to establish cooperation, my hare choice will be clear signal that we need to find a different cooperation mechanism\n\n[move] hare - Continuing with the strategy that worked in the previous round based on the observed pattern of play.\n"

Analyzing the pattern:\n   - My opponent isn't simply alternating moves as I hypothesized\n   - They seem to be adapting their strategy based on our interactions\n   - They matched my hare move in the last round after playing differently in prior rounds\n\n3. This suggests several possibilities:\n   - They might be using a tit-for-tat strategy with a one-round delay\n   - They might be trying to establish some pattern of coordination\n   - They might have switched to a more cautious strategy after our first two rounds\n\n4. Considering potential outcomes for this round:\n   - If we both choose stag: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - If we both choose hare: 2 points each (same as last round)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (worst case)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points\n\n5.

Analyzing the current situation:\n   - We successfully coordinated on stag-stag in the previous round\n   - This resulted in the optimal outcome of 6 points each\n   - We've demonstrated mutual understanding of the benefits of cooperation\n   - This creates a potential path toward continued cooperation\n\n3. Game theory considerations:\n   - Stag-stag is a Nash equilibrium (no player benefits from unilaterally changing strategy)\n   - It's also Pareto optimal (no other outcome makes one player better without making the other worse)\n   - However, it's a risky strategy compared to hare, which has a higher minimum payoff\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - Having experienced the high payoff from cooperation, both players are likely motivated to continue\n   - The successful coordination builds trust and establishes a precedent\n   - Deviating now would break this trust and potentially revert to lower-payoff outcomes\n\n5. Expected strategies:\n   - Since we've established successful cooperation, my opponent is likely to continue with stag\n   - Maintaining the stag choice reinforces the cooperative equilibrium\n   - Any deviation would likely trigger a cascade of retaliatory moves and reduced payoffs\n\n6.

Strategic adjustment:\n   - I need to protect myself from further exploitation\n   - Playing hare provides a better minimum outcome (2 vs 1)\n   - It also potentially punishes their defection if they expected me to continue with stag\n\n6.

Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
