Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where cooperation can yield the best mutual outcome.\n2. Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each (12 total)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (4 total)\n   - One stag, one hare: 1 point for stag chooser, 4 points for hare chooser (5 total)\n3. The highest individual payoff I can get is 6 points by choosing stag, but only if the other player also chooses stag.\n4. If I choose stag but the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point (worst outcome).\n5. Choosing hare guarantees me at least 2 points and possibly 4 points.\n6. This is the first round with a fresh player, so there's no history to base my decision on.\n7. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, which could establish trust.\n8. Since this is a fresh game, I'll try to establish a cooperative norm by choosing stag.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to aim for the optimal mutual outcome.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing cooperation for mutual benefit\n"

Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each (optimal mutual outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (suboptimal)\n   - One stag, one hare: 1 point for stag chooser, 4 points for hare chooser\n4. Since the other player chose stag in the first round, they've demonstrated cooperative behavior.\n5. There's a good chance they'll continue this cooperation strategy.\n6. Deviating to hare could get me 4 points if they stick with stag, but this would break cooperation.\n7. If I switch to hare and they anticipate this by also switching to hare, we both only get 2 points.\n8. Maintaining cooperation with stag seems most beneficial for long-term gain.\n9.

The payoff structure remains unchanged:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each (optimal mutual outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (suboptimal mutual outcome)\n   - One stag, one hare: 1 point for stag chooser, 4 points for hare chooser\n4. Our pattern of mutual cooperation has been perfectly consistent across all previous rounds.\n5. The other player has shown exceptional reliability in choosing stag throughout our extensive interactions.\n6. This established pattern of cooperation represents the Pareto optimal solution.\n7. With thirteen rounds of consistent cooperation, the level of established trust is extremely high.\n8. There are no indications of any change in game parameters or the other player's strategy.\n9. The extensive history strongly predicts continued cooperative behavior.\n10. The expected value of continuing with stag (6 points) remains superior to any alternative strategy.\n\nFinal decision: I will maintain our successful cooperative strategy.\n\n[move] stag - Continuing our optimal cooperative strategy that maximizes mutual benefit and has proven successful across thirteen consecutive rounds\n"
