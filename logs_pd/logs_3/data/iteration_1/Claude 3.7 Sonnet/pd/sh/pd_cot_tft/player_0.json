Given the opponent's previous behavior of choosing the individually safer option (hare), it's reasonable to protect myself from exploitation while maintaining a reasonable score.\n\n5.

My opponent's complete sequence of moves: hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, hare, stag, hare, hare.\n   I notice they've chosen hare in rounds 8 and 9, breaking the alternating pattern they seemed to follow earlier.\n\n3. Looking at their most recent choices:\n   - Rounds 7, 8, 9: stag, hare, hare\n   - This could indicate they're more likely to choose hare now\n\n4. However, considering their overall pattern, they've never chosen hare more than twice in a row:\n   - After rounds 5-6 (both hare), they switched to stag\n   - This suggests they might switch to stag after choosing hare in rounds 8-9\n\n5. Also relevant is that they've chosen hare 6 times and stag 3 times overall, showing a preference for hare (the safer option).\n\n6. Given these considerations, there's still a reasonable chance they'll switch to stag for round 10, especially if they had some alternating strategy that was temporarily suspended.\n\n7. If they choose stag:\n   - My choosing stag would give us both 6 points\n   - My choosing hare would give me 4 points and them 1 point\n\n8. If they choose hare:\n   - My choosing stag would give me 1 point and them 4 points\n   - My choosing hare would give us both 2 points\n\n9. Given their overall preference for hare and recent consecutive hare choices, I think hare is the safer choice for me - it guarantees at least 2 points rather than risking getting only 1 point.\n\n[move] (Considering the opponent's preference for hare and their recent consecutive hare choices, choosing the safer option) hare\n"

Therefore, to protect myself from exploitation and ensure a consistent, if modest, payoff, I should continue choosing hare.\n\n[move] (Based on the opponent's consistent pattern of choosing hare in recent rounds, choosing the safer option to avoid exploitation) hare\n"

This might suggest they occasionally \"reward\" my stag choice with a stag in the following round.\n\n6. However, this pattern hasn't held recently - after my stag choice in round 6, they did choose stag in round 7, but I've chosen hare ever since, and they've settled into consistently choosing hare.\n\n7.

I'm faced with a decision:\n   - Continue with the safe hare choice, guaranteeing 2 points\n   - Risk choosing stag to potentially break the pattern and establish cooperation\n\n9. Since the opponent has shown such a strong preference for hare (especially recently), choosing stag is highly risky with little evidence they would respond cooperatively.\n\n[move] (Based on the opponent's established pattern of consistently choosing hare in recent rounds, maintaining the safer strategy) hare\n"

A pattern is becoming clearer:\n   - They chose stag in rounds 2, 4, 7, and now 14\n   - These rounds all came after I had chosen stag in the previous round (rounds 1, 3, 6) or after I had chosen hare following my own stag choice (rounds 12-13-14)\n\n4.
