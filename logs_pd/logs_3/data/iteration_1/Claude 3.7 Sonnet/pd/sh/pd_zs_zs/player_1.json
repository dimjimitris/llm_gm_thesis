This is a stag hunt scenario where mutual cooperation (stag-stag) yields the best collective outcome, but choosing hare is safer if I'm uncertain about my opponent's move.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I have no information about their tendencies. The most cooperative and potentially rewarding option would be to choose stag, hoping they also choose stag for the best mutual outcome (6 points each). However, if they choose hare, I would only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nI'll choose stag as a signal of willingness to cooperate, which could establish a cooperative pattern for future rounds if we play multiple times.\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing stag to aim for mutual cooperation and the best collective outcome.\n"
