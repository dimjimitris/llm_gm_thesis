You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The stag choice has the highest mutual benefit (6 points) if we coordinate, but carries risk if the other player chooses hare (leaving me with only 1 point). The hare choice guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4.\n\nFor this first move without any prior information about my opponent's tendencies, I'll choose the cooperative option that offers the highest mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag\n"
