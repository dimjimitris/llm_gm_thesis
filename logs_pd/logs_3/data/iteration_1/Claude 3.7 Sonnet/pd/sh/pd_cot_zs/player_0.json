Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: We both get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: We both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4 points, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic coordination game (specifically a \"stag hunt\") where mutual cooperation (stag) yields the best collective outcome.\n\n3. If we both choose stag, we both maximize our points (6 each).\n\n4. However, choosing stag is risky - if my opponent chooses hare while I choose stag, I only get 1 point.\n\n5. Choosing hare is the safer option - I get at least 2 points, and possibly 4 if my opponent chooses stag.\n\n6. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, with no prior history to inform my decision, I should consider what most players would rationally choose.\n\n7. The collective-optimal choice is stag, and most rational players would recognize this. If both players trust each other to be rational, choosing stag is better.\n\n8. I'll choose stag as it offers the highest potential payoff, signaling my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing stag to aim for the optimal outcome where we both get 6 points.\n"

Let me review the payoff matrix again:\n   - Both choose stag: We both get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: We both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4 points, opponent gets 1\n\n4. Since my opponent chose stag in the first round, there's a good chance they'll continue this cooperative strategy.\n\n5. If I continue choosing stag and they do too, we both maximize our points at 6 each.\n\n6. If I switch to hare while they continue with stag, I would get 4 points but potentially damage future cooperation.\n\n7. The long-term benefit of sustained stag-stag cooperation (6 points per round) outweighs the one-time gain from defecting to hare (4 points once, then likely deteriorating to lower payoffs).\n\n8. Since there's evidence of willingness to cooperate from the first round, maintaining that cooperation is the optimal strategy.\n\n9.
