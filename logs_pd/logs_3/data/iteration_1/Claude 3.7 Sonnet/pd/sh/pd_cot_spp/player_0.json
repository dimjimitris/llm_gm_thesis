Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This game is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" coordination game where cooperation (both choosing stag) yields the highest joint reward.\n2. Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6 (best joint outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2 (safe but lower outcome)\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4 (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1 (best individual outcome)\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, there's no history to base decisions on.\n4. The stag choice offers higher reward (6) but higher risk (could get only 1).\n5. The hare choice offers lower maximum reward (4) but is safer (minimum 2).\n6. With no prior information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to decide if I want to promote cooperation or play safe.\n7. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate which could establish mutual trust for future rounds if they also choose stag.\n8. In the long run, mutual cooperation (stag-stag) yields the highest payoff.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to promote cooperation from the beginning.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6 (best joint outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2 (safe but lower outcome)\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4 (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1 (best for opponent)\n4. Since my opponent chose stag in the previous round, they demonstrated willingness to cooperate.\n5. The rational move for both of us is to continue choosing stag, as this maximizes our individual and joint payoffs.\n6. Deviating to hare would break the cooperation and likely lead to worse outcomes in future rounds.\n7.

Looking at our history:\n   - Round 1: Both chose stag, each scored 6 points\n   - Round 2: Both chose stag, each scored 6 points\n4.

While choosing hare might yield 4 points in one round if my opponent stays with stag, this would likely break our cooperative pattern.\n7. Breaking cooperation would probably lead to both of us choosing hare in future rounds (only 2 points each).\n8.
