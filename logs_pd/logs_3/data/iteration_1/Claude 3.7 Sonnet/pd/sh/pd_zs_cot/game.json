This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare), but (stag, stag) is Pareto optimal.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, there's no history to base my decision on. I need to consider what's likely for a first move.\n\n4. The stag strategy offers higher reward (6 points) but carries higher risk (only 1 point if they choose hare).\n\n5. The hare strategy is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) and could yield 4 points if they choose stag.\n\n6. Without communication, coordination is difficult. However, many players might recognize that (stag, stag) is the optimal outcome and choose accordingly.\n\n7.
