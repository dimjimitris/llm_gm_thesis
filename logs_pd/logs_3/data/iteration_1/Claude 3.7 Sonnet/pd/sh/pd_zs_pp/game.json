I understand we're going to play the stag hunt game, and I'm facing a new player.\n\nLooking at the payoff matrix:\n- If both choose stag: 6 points each\n- If both choose hare: 2 points each\n- If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point for me, 4 points for them\n- If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points for me, 1 point for them\n\n[move] stag\n\nI'm choosing stag because it offers the potential for the highest mutual benefit (6 points each). While there's some risk if my opponent chooses hare (in which case I'd only get 1 point), I believe starting with cooperation is a good strategy in this game. The stag choice represents an investment in mutual cooperation that could lead to better outcomes for both of us if we can establish trust.\n"

They may have been testing different strategies and now expect me to continue with hare\n3. If we can establish a pattern of both choosing stag, we both get 6 points consistently, which is optimal\n\nBy switching to stag, I'm signaling a willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.
