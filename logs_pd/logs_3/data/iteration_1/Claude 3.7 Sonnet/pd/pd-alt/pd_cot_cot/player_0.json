He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Our game history shows perfect cooperation through all ten rounds:\n   - Round 1-10: Both cooperated \u2192 6 points each per round\n   - Total so far: 60 points each\n\n2. The pattern of mutual cooperation has been maintained without exception through ten consecutive rounds, demonstrating a deeply established cooperative relationship.\n\n3. This cooperative strategy has consistently yielded the maximum possible outcome (6 points per round) for both players, proving to be optimal for individual and collective benefit.\n\n4. I should evaluate whether any circumstances have changed that might warrant reconsidering my approach:\n   - No indication of the game ending soon\n   - My opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to cooperation\n   - The payoff structure remains unchanged\n\n5. In extended repeated games like this one, where the endpoint remains unknown, cooperation continues to be the theoretically optimal strategy when trust has been firmly established.\n\n6. The expected utility of continued cooperation (6 points per round) substantially exceeds the one-time advantage from defection (4 points) followed by the likely breakdown of cooperation.\n\n7. With ten rounds of successful cooperation creating a robust foundation of trust and predictability, continuing with cooperation remains the rational choice to maximize my total points.\n\n[move] (Maintaining our long-established pattern of mutual cooperation that has consistently yielded optimal outcomes for both players) cooperation\n"
