This pattern has been remarkably stable in the second half of our game. My total score is currently 29 points (1+4+1+4+2+1+4+2\u00d78).\n\nWhile it's theoretically possible that we could both benefit from mutual cooperation (6 points each instead of 2), my opponent has:\n1. Defected every single time I've cooperated (3/3 attempts)\n2. Consistently defected for the last nine rounds straight\n3. Given no signals of willingness to cooperate lately\n\nUnder these circumstances:\n\n[move] (With my opponent having defected in nine consecutive rounds and exploited 100% of my cooperation attempts, there is no strategic basis to expect they would suddenly cooperate) defection\n"
