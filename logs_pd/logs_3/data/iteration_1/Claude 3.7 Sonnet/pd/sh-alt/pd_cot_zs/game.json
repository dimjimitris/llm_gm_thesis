This is the first round with a fresh player, so I have no information about their tendencies.\n\n3. The stag option yields higher mutual benefit (4 points each) but carries risk of exploitation (only 1 point if they choose hare).\n\n4. The hare option guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 6 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\n5. In the absence of prior history, mutual cooperation (stag-stag) would be optimal for collective benefit.\n\n6. Since this is a repeated game (multiple rounds), establishing a cooperative norm early might be beneficial for long-term gains.\n\n7. I'll choose stag as an initial gesture of cooperation, hoping to establish a pattern of mutual stag choices for maximum joint benefit.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing stag to aim for mutual cooperation and establish trust from the beginning.\n"
