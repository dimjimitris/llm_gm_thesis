At this mature stage of repeated interaction, the cooperative equilibrium is fully solidified and appears to be the definitive strategy for both players.\n\n9. The expected utility calculation continues to heavily favor cooperation:\n   - The short-term gain from defection remains small (only 2 additional points)\n   - The potential long-term loss from breaking cooperation would be substantial\n   - The risk of damaging such a well-established relationship for a minor gain would be irrational\n\n10. There continue to be no strategic indicators, changes in pattern, or logical reasons that would warrant altering our highly successful approach.\n\nFinal decision: I'll maintain our extremely successful cooperative relationship by choosing stag again.\n\n[move] stag\n"
