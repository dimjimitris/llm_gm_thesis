Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I need to analyze the payoff matrix for this game:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, they get 6\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6, they get 1\n\n2. This is a classic stag hunt game with a twist - the payoffs for mismatched choices are asymmetric, heavily favoring the hare chooser.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I can't base my decision on their past behavior.\n\n4. The cooperative equilibrium (both stag) yields the highest mutual benefit (4 points each).\n\n5. However, choosing stag is risky - if they choose hare while I choose stag, I only get 1 point.\n\n6. Choosing hare guarantees me at least 2 points (if they also choose hare) and potentially 6 points (if they choose stag).\n\n7. As a new game with a new player, they might be inclined toward cooperation, so choosing stag could be beneficial.\n\n8. However, without knowing their strategy or having established trust, the safe play is hare.\n\n9. Since this appears to be the first round, I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate, hoping to establish a pattern of mutual stag choices for maximum joint benefit.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to attempt establishing cooperative play.\n\n[move] stag\n"

This suggests the other player may be open to cooperation since they chose stag in the first round.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each (optimal mutual outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (suboptimal mutual outcome)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, they get 6 (I get exploited)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6, they get 1 (I exploit them)\n\n4. Since the other player chose stag in the first round, there's a good chance they will continue with this cooperative strategy.\n\n5. By choosing stag again, I can maintain the cooperative equilibrium which benefits us both optimally.\n\n6. There's always a risk they might switch to hare to exploit my stag choice, but based on their first move, cooperation seems likely.\n\n7. The mutual stag choice (4 points each) is better than the mutual hare choice (2 points each).\n\n8. Given the positive first interaction, continuing with stag is the rational choice to maintain cooperation.\n\n9. If they defect to hare in this round, I can reconsider my strategy for subsequent rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue the cooperative strategy with stag.\n\n[move] stag\n"

The consistent cooperative behavior through two rounds strongly indicates the other player is likely to continue choosing stag.\n\n5. We've established a mutually beneficial equilibrium, with both of us receiving the maximum possible consistent payoff (4 points per round).\n\n6. Deviating from stag to hare would yield me a one-time gain of 6 points if they continue choosing stag, but it would likely break the cooperation pattern.\n\n7. This could lead to future rounds where we both choose hare (only 2 points each), or unpredictable mixed strategies with lower expected returns.\n\n8. Since this appears to be a multi-round game, maintaining the cooperative equilibrium is likely the best long-term strategy.\n\n9.
