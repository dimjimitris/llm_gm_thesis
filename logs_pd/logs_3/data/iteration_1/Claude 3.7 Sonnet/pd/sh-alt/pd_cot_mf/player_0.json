Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Round 10: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each\n11. Round 11: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each\n\n2. We've now completed 11 rounds with a remarkably consistent pattern:\n   - Initial cooperation in round 1 (stag-stag)\n   - My opponent has chosen hare for 10 consecutive rounds\n   - We've had 8 consecutive rounds of mutual hare choices\n\n3. At this point, the evidence is overwhelming that my opponent has a fixed strategy of always choosing hare after the first round.\n\n4. In repeated games, even with very consistent opponent behavior, there can be theoretical value in occasionally testing if the opponent might change strategy.\n\n5. After 11 rounds, this might be a reasonable point to test whether the opponent might reconsider cooperation, especially given that:\n   - The cost of testing is relatively small (1 point instead of 2 points for one round)\n   - The potential benefit if opponent also chooses stag is significant (4 points instead of 2)\n   - The long period of stability might have shifted the opponent's thinking\n\n6. However, the probability of my opponent suddenly changing their strategy after 10 consecutive hare choices is extremely low.\n\n7. The expected value calculations still strongly favor choosing hare:\n   - If I choose stag: Based on extensive history, opponent will almost certainly choose hare \u2192 1 point\n   - If I choose hare: Based on extensive history, opponent will almost certainly choose hare \u2192 2 points\n\n8.

After 12 rounds, the pattern remains extraordinarily consistent:\n   - My opponent chose stag only in round 1\n   - My opponent has chosen hare for 11 consecutive rounds\n   - We've had 9 consecutive rounds of mutual hare choices\n\n3. This game has now lasted long enough to establish with extremely high confidence that my opponent is committed to the hare strategy for the foreseeable future.\n\n4.

At this point, the rational strategy is to continue with the established equilibrium, which guarantees me the best outcome given my opponent's demonstrated behavior.\n\n7.

This extended history provides overwhelming evidence that my opponent has adopted a fixed strategy of always choosing hare after the initial round.\n\n4.
