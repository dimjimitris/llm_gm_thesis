He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

The payoff matrix shows:\n   - Both choose stag: both get 4 points (cooperative outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: both get 2 points (safer but suboptimal)\n   - Mixed choices: the stag hunter gets 1 point, the hare hunter gets 6 points\n3. This is a classic coordination game with risk/reward tradeoffs.\n4. I'm playing against a new player with no history to base decisions on.\n5. The cooperative outcome (stag-stag) gives the best joint reward (8 total points).\n6. However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I'll only get 1 point.\n7. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, and possibly 6 points.\n8. Since this is the first round with a new player, I should consider what most people would choose.\n9. People often start with cooperative moves in repeated games to establish trust.\n10. The potential for mutual benefit (4 points each) from choosing stag is attractive.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag and hope to establish a cooperative pattern.\n\n[move] stag I'm selecting stag in hopes we can establish mutual cooperation for the best joint outcome."

My opponent has now chosen hare in eleven consecutive rounds without any deviation.\n\n3. This extensive history provides overwhelming evidence that my opponent has a fixed strategy of always choosing hare.\n\n4. I've tested cooperation twice (rounds 1 and 4) and was exploited both times, receiving only 1 point.\n\n5. We've been in a stable hare-hare equilibrium for nine consecutive rounds now.\n\n6. While this equilibrium yields suboptimal outcomes compared to mutual cooperation (stag-stag), it represents the best possible outcome given my opponent's demonstrated strategy.\n\n7. At this point, the probability of my opponent suddenly changing their strategy after eleven consistent rounds is negligible.\n\n8. Game theory principles clearly indicate that the best response to an opponent who always plays hare is to play hare as well.\n\n9. Expected value calculation:\n   - If I choose hare: ~100% chance of 2 points based on extensive history\n   - If I choose stag: ~100% chance of 1 point based on extensive history\n\n10. The only rational choice continues to be choosing hare to secure the consistent 2 points.\n\n11. While one might be curious about testing stag again after so many rounds, doing so would be irrational given the clear pattern and would likely result in a worse outcome for me.\n\n[move] hare After eleven rounds with identical opponent behavior, continuing with hare remains the only rational choice to maximize my points."
