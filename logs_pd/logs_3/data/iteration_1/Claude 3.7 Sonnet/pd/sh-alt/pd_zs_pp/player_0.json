You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

This suggests they might be adapting their strategy.\n\nLooking at the broader pattern, after a mutual hare outcome (like we just had in round 15), choosing stag has consistently led to mutual stag cooperation (rounds 6, 10, 14).
