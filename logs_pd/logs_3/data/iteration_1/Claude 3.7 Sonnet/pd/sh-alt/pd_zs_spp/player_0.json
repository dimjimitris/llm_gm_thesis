You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The payoffs are:\n- Both choose stag: 4 points each (mutual cooperation)\n- Both choose hare: 2 points each (mutual defection)\n- One chooses stag, one chooses hare: 1 point for stag, 6 points for hare (exploitation)\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no established history, I need to balance risk and reward. Choosing \"stag\" has the highest mutual benefit (4 points each) but risks being exploited (1 point if they choose hare). Choosing \"hare\" guarantees at least 2 points and possibly 6 points.\n\nIn the first round, I'll choose the cooperative option to establish goodwill.\n\n[move] stag\n"
