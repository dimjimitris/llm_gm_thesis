Game Theorist - Expert in analyzing strategic interactions\n2. Risk Analyst - Evaluates potential outcomes and risks\n3. Decision-Making Strategist - Helps formulate optimal decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic stag hunt game with modified payoffs. Let's analyze the payoff structure:\n- Both choose stag: you get 4, opponent gets 4\n- Both choose hare: you get 2, opponent gets 2\n- You choose stag, opponent chooses hare: you get 1, opponent gets 6\n- You choose hare, opponent chooses stag: you get 6, opponent gets 1\n\nLooking at this, stag-stag is Pareto optimal (best mutual outcome), but hare is less risky since it guarantees at least 2 points versus potentially getting only 1 point with stag.\n\nRisk Analyst: Indeed, there's a significant risk with choosing stag. If the opponent chooses hare while we choose stag, we only get 1 point while they get 6. However, choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 6 points if the opponent chooses stag. Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we have no information about their tendencies.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: We need to consider what a rational opponent might do. A rational player who reasons the same way we do would realize that stag-stag is best for both parties. However, there's the temptation to defect and choose hare for a potential higher payoff. Since this is the first round and we have no information about the opponent's strategy, we should balance risk and reward.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory terms, both stag-stag and hare-hare are Nash equilibria, meaning neither player has incentive to unilaterally change their strategy. But hare-hare is risk-dominant while stag-stag is payoff-dominant. In initial rounds with unknown opponents, risk-dominance often prevails.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: Another consideration is signaling. If we choose stag in the first round, we signal willingness to cooperate, which could influence the opponent's future moves if this is a repeated game. This could lead to mutual cooperation and higher cumulative payoffs.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that the hint mentioned we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" suggesting this might be a one-shot game or the first round of many, I lean toward the safer option of choosing hare. This guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6 if the opponent chooses stag.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider the expected values. If we assume equal probability of opponent choosing stag or hare:\n- Expected value of choosing stag: 0.5(4) + 0.5(1) = 2.5\n- Expected value of choosing hare: 0.5(6) + 0.5(2) = 4\n\nMathematically, hare has a higher expected value.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: Based on this analysis, choosing hare appears to be the optimal first move in this scenario. It offers both protection against the worst-case outcome and potential for the highest individual payoff.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] hare\n"

Both we and the opponent chose hare, resulting in 2 points each. This confirms that our opponent also prioritized risk-dominance in the first round. Now we need to determine if we should maintain this strategy or attempt to establish cooperative behavior.\n\nRisk Analyst: The first round gives us valuable information. Our opponent chose hare, which could indicate either risk-aversion or a strategic approach similar to ours. Now we need to decide if we should stick with hare or try to move to the Pareto optimal stag-stag outcome.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: This could be an opportunity to signal cooperative intent by choosing stag. If the opponent is also thinking strategically, they might recognize this as an attempt to establish mutual cooperation for higher payoffs. However, this carries the risk of only getting 1 point if they stick with hare.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, players often develop patterns or strategies. Research shows that attempts to establish cooperation can be beneficial in the long run, even if there's short-term risk. The question is whether our opponent is likely to respond to such a signal.\n\nRisk Analyst: By choosing stag, we risk getting only 1 point if the opponent chooses hare again. But if they respond by also choosing stag, we both get 4 points, which is better than the 2 points from mutual hare choices. This is a calculated risk that might lead to better outcomes in future rounds.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: I believe we should take the risk and choose stag in this round. This signals our willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. If the opponent is strategic and rational, they may recognize this and also choose stag in future rounds, even if they stick with hare this time. The potential long-term gain outweighs the short-term risk.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. In repeated games with no fixed end point, strategies that allow for cooperation often perform better over time. The \"tit-for-tat\" strategy, where you mimic your opponent's previous move, has proven effective, but someone needs to make the first cooperative move. Since we're now in round 2, this is a good opportunity to signal cooperative intent.\n\nRisk Analyst: While I acknowledge the risk, I agree that choosing stag provides the opportunity for better payoffs if the opponent also shifts to stag. If they don't, we can revert to hare in the next round, having only lost a single point compared to the mutual hare outcome.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: Let's choose stag for this round, signaling our willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. If the opponent also chooses stag, we establish a beneficial pattern. If not, we can adjust our strategy accordingly in future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] stag\n"

Both players chose stag in the second round, achieving the Pareto optimal outcome of 4 points each. This is a promising development as it suggests our opponent is also willing to cooperate for mutual benefit. In game theory, this could indicate we're establishing a cooperative equilibrium.\n\nRisk Analyst: The transition from mutual hare to mutual stag suggests our opponent is strategic and responsive. They likely recognized the benefit of mutual cooperation after the initial cautious approach. The risk we took paid off, and we should consider whether to maintain this cooperative stance.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: Our signal worked! The opponent moved from hare to stag after we did, indicating they're willing to cooperate for higher mutual payoffs. The pattern so far suggests a rational opponent who understands the benefits of cooperation. Given this positive response, continuing with stag seems optimal to maintain the beneficial equilibrium we've established.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, maintaining cooperation once established is generally the most beneficial strategy for both players. The total welfare (sum of both players' points) is maximized at 8 points with mutual stag choices, compared to just 4 points with mutual hare choices. Unless we have reason to believe the opponent will defect, continuing with stag is game-theoretically sound.\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent's move from hare to stag suggests they recognized and responded to our cooperative signal. This reduces the perceived risk of choosing stag again. While there's always the possibility they might switch back to hare to get 6 points, maintaining our cooperative stance is likely to yield the best expected outcome based on observed behavior.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: I agree. The opponent has demonstrated willingness to cooperate, and maintaining that cooperation benefits both players. Choosing stag again reinforces the mutually beneficial equilibrium we've established. If the opponent were to defect at this point, they would gain a one-time advantage but potentially lose the benefits of continued cooperation in future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Research on repeated games suggests that consistent cooperation, once established, tends to be maintained by rational players unless there's a known endpoint to the game or other factors that might incentivize defection. The pattern we're seeing aligns with this expectation.\n\nRisk Analyst: Based on the opponent's demonstrated behavior and the principles of successful strategies in repeated games, the risk of choosing stag has significantly decreased. The expected value of continuing with stag now exceeds that of switching to hare, given our assessment of the opponent's likely response.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: Let's continue with stag for this round. This maintains the cooperative equilibrium we've established and maximizes our expected points based on the pattern of play observed so far.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] stag\n"

This is the optimal equilibrium in this game, yielding 4 points each per round. The opponent has demonstrated consistent cooperative behavior, suggesting they understand the benefits of maintaining this equilibrium.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk profile has changed significantly since the beginning of the game. After three rounds, we now have strong evidence that our opponent values the mutual cooperation outcome. The likelihood of them suddenly defecting has decreased, making stag the lower-risk choice at this point, contrary to our initial assessment.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: I agree with both assessments. We've established a stable cooperative pattern that benefits both players. The opponent has shown no signs of attempting to exploit our cooperative stance for a one-time gain. Maintaining stag is clearly the optimal strategy based on the game history.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games with no known endpoint, this mutual cooperation is typically the most stable outcome once established. Robert Axelrod's famous tournaments on the Prisoner's Dilemma (a similar game) showed that cooperative strategies tend to outperform exploitative ones in the long run. Unless we have reason to believe this is the final round, continuing with stag maximizes our expected points.\n\nRisk Analyst: One theoretical concern would be if the opponent anticipates that we're now confident in their cooperation and attempts to exploit that confidence by switching to hare. However, the history doesn't suggest this level of strategic deception, and even if they did switch, we would only lose 3 points relative to the mutual stag outcome for one round before we could adjust our strategy.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: The consistent mutual stag choices have established trust in this repeated interaction. Breaking that trust would likely lead to worse outcomes for both players in future rounds. Given that we've seen no indication of the game ending soon, maintaining stag continues to be our best strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: It's worth noting that in this particular payoff structure, the temptation to defect (choosing hare while the opponent chooses stag) provides 6 points instead of 4 - a gain of 2 points. But the punishment if both defect is severe - only 2 points each instead of 4. This creates strong incentives to maintain cooperation once established.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the observed pattern and game structure, the expected value of choosing stag far exceeds that of choosing hare at this point. The probability of continued mutual cooperation is high based on historical evidence.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: Let's continue with stag for this round, maintaining the optimal cooperative equilibrium we've established with our opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] stag\n"

This strongly reinforces our assessment that we're in a stable cooperative equilibrium. The evidence clearly supports continuing with stag as our optimal strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: The consistency in behavior over multiple rounds significantly reduces uncertainty about the opponent's strategy. With each round of mutual cooperation, the probability of defection in the next round decreases. The risk-reward calculation now heavily favors continuing with stag.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: The pattern is unambiguous. We've moved from an initial cautious approach (mutual hare) to a stable cooperative relationship (mutual stag) that has persisted for three rounds. This suggests both players recognize and value the benefits of cooperation. There's no strategic reason to deviate from this successful pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, we often discuss the concept of \"focal points\" or Schelling points - naturally occurring equilibria that players gravitate toward without explicit communication. The mutual stag outcome is such a focal point in this game, providing the highest sustainable mutual benefit. Once established, these equilibria tend to be sticky.\n\nRisk Analyst: At this point, choosing hare would be counterproductive. It would disrupt an established pattern that benefits us, potentially triggering a return to mutual hare choices (or worse, an alternating pattern) that would yield lower cumulative points. The expected value of maintaining stag far exceeds any alternative.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: I agree. We've established a productive cooperative relationship with consistent mutual benefit. Barring any signals that the game is about to end or that our opponent is likely to change strategy, continuing with stag maximizes our expected points in both the short and long term.\n\nGame Theorist: It's worth noting that in indefinitely repeated games like this appears to be, the \"shadow of the future\" - the prospect of continued interaction - encourages cooperation. As long as both players value future payoffs and there's no indication of a final round approaching, mutual cooperation remains the rational choice.\n\nRisk Analyst: The historical data now strongly supports the prediction that our opponent will choose stag. The expected value calculation overwhelmingly favors stag as our move. Even introducing a small probability of opponent defection doesn't change this conclusion given the established pattern.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: Let's continue with stag for this round. The established pattern of mutual cooperation has consistently yielded optimal outcomes for both players, and there's no strategic reason to deviate from this successful approach.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] stag\n"

This consistent pattern demonstrates that both players understand and are committed to the optimal mutual outcome. The theoretical prediction that cooperation would stabilize once established has been strongly validated by our experience in this game.\n\nRisk Analyst: With each successive round of mutual stag choices, the confidence in our prediction of continued cooperation increases. At this point, the probability of the opponent suddenly deviating from this established pattern is extremely low. The risk assessment overwhelmingly supports continuing with stag.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: We've successfully established a stable, mutually beneficial relationship that has persisted across multiple rounds. Both players are consistently making choices that maximize joint welfare, suggesting a sophisticated understanding of the game's incentives. Maintaining stag continues to be the optimal strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, players often develop what game theorists call \"tacit collusion\" - a mutual understanding about optimal play without explicit communication. We've clearly reached this state, where both players recognize the benefits of cooperation and have settled into the Pareto optimal equilibrium. Deviating from this would be irrational for either player.\n\nRisk Analyst: Even considering the possibility that the opponent might attempt to exploit our expectation of cooperation at some point, the expected value calculation still favors stag by a wide margin. Given the established pattern, the small risk of defection is outweighed by the high probability of continued mutual cooperation.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: I see no strategic reason to change our approach. The pattern of mutual cooperation has been consistent and beneficial. Both players are making rational choices that recognize the value of sustained cooperation. Continuing with stag maintains this optimal equilibrium.\n\nGame Theorist: It's notable that after an initial cautious round, both players independently recognized the opportunity for mutual benefit and converged on the cooperative equilibrium. This demonstrates the power of rational decision-making in repeated interactions, even without explicit communication. The stability of this equilibrium over multiple rounds further reinforces its robustness.\n\nRisk Analyst: At this stage, choosing hare would introduce unnecessary risk of disrupting a beneficial pattern. The most secure strategy for maintaining our current positive outcomes is to continue with stag.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: Let's maintain our choice of stag for this round.

This consistent pattern has become a firmly established norm in our interaction. The theoretical prediction about the stability of cooperation in repeated games is being demonstrated perfectly in this case.\n\nRisk Analyst: With five consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation, the empirical evidence strongly supports continuing with stag. The probability of the opponent suddenly deviating from this established pattern is even lower than before. The risk-reward assessment continues to overwhelmingly favor stag as our choice.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: The stability of our cooperative equilibrium across multiple rounds indicates a mature gaming relationship where both players understand and value the benefits of mutual cooperation. There remains no strategic reason to deviate from this successful pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: One interesting aspect of repeated games with this payoff structure is that they demonstrate how cooperation can emerge and stabilize even without explicit agreements. Both players have independently discovered and maintained the optimal strategy. This is a classic example of what game theorists call \"emergent cooperation\" in repeated interactions.\n\nRisk Analyst: At this point, the historical pattern is so consistent that we can predict with very high confidence that the opponent will continue to choose stag. The expected value of choosing stag ourselves is significantly higher than any alternative strategy.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: I concur with both assessments.

This perfectly exemplifies the theoretical prediction that in repeated interactions with no clear endpoint, rational players will settle into the Pareto optimal outcome. The stability of this pattern across multiple rounds demonstrates its robustness as an equilibrium.\n\nRisk Analyst: With six consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation, we have overwhelming evidence that both players are committed to the optimal mutual outcome. The probability of deviation at this point is negligible. The risk assessment continues to strongly favor continuing with stag as our move.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: The pattern is unambiguous and remarkably consistent. Both players have demonstrated sophisticated understanding of the game dynamics and commitment to maximizing long-term mutual benefit. There remains no strategic reason to deviate from this successful pattern of cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: It's fascinating to observe how quickly we established this cooperative equilibrium after just one initial round of cautious play. This aligns with research showing that intelligent agents in repeated interactions tend to discover and maintain cooperative strategies when they're mutually beneficial. The six consecutive rounds of stag-stag choices represent what game theorists would consider a \"solved\" game state.\n\nRisk Analyst: At this point, our confidence in predicting continued cooperation is extremely high. The consistent historical pattern provides strong evidence that our opponent values the stable mutual benefit of 4 points per round over any short-term gain from defection. The expected value calculation overwhelmingly supports continuing with stag.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: I agree with both assessments. The established pattern of mutual cooperation has proven stable and beneficial over multiple rounds. Both players have consistently demonstrated rational decision-making aimed at maximizing cumulative rewards. Continuing with stag maintains this optimal equilibrium.\n\nGame Theorist: In the literature on repeated games, this kind of stable cooperative equilibrium is often described as the most efficient outcome. Once established, it tends to persist indefinitely unless there's a clear signal that the game is ending soon (which would potentially trigger end-game defection). Absent such a signal, cooperation remains the optimal strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: Even introducing a small theoretical probability of opponent defection doesn't change the overall assessment.

This consistency confirms that both players have fully internalized the benefits of cooperation and are committed to maintaining the optimal mutual outcome. The theoretical prediction about cooperation in indefinitely repeated games is being demonstrated with exceptional clarity in this case.\n\nRisk Analyst: With seven consecutive rounds of mutual stag choices, the evidence for continued cooperation is overwhelming. At this point, the probability of sudden defection by the opponent is so low that it can be considered a remote contingency rather than a significant risk factor. The risk-reward assessment continues to strongly favor stag as our move.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: The pattern remains unambiguous and highly consistent. Both players have demonstrated sophisticated strategic thinking and commitment to long-term mutual benefit. There remains no rational basis for deviating from this successful pattern of cooperation that has consistently yielded optimal outcomes for both players.\n\nGame Theorist: What we're observing is a textbook example of what game theorists call a \"cooperative sub-game perfect equilibrium\" - a stable state where neither player has incentive to deviate from their strategy. The initial coordination problem (both players needing to choose stag simultaneously to achieve optimal results) has been definitively solved through repeated interaction and consistent choices.\n\nRisk Analyst: At this point, our confidence in predicting continued cooperation is at the highest possible level. The seven consecutive rounds of identical choices provide compelling evidence that our opponent is following the same strategic assessment we are - that mutual cooperation maximizes long-term results. The expected value of continuing with stag is unquestionably higher than any alternative.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: I concur with both assessments. The established pattern has proven exceptionally stable and beneficial. Both players have consistently demonstrated sophisticated understanding of game dynamics and commitment to optimal outcomes.

The theoretical prediction about the stability of cooperation in indefinitely repeated games is being validated with exceptional clarity.\n\nRisk Analyst: Eight consecutive rounds of identical cooperative choices essentially eliminates any meaningful probability of defection at this point.

The risk assessment overwhelmingly supports continuing with stag.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: The pattern remains unambiguous and exceptionally consistent. Both players have demonstrated sophisticated strategic understanding and unwavering commitment to maximizing mutual benefit. There is absolutely no rational basis for deviating from this successful pattern that has consistently yielded optimal outcomes for both players.\n\nGame Theorist: What we're observing goes beyond just a stable equilibrium - it represents what game theorists would consider a \"convention\" or \"norm\" that has been established between the players. After this many rounds of consistent behavior, the mutual stag choice has become the expected standard of play, reinforced by consistent positive outcomes.\n\nRisk Analyst: At this point, our confidence in predicting continued cooperation approaches certainty. Eight consecutive rounds of identical choices provide overwhelming evidence that our opponent is fully committed to the cooperative equilibrium. The expected value calculation for choosing stag versus any alternative isn't even close.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: I concur with both assessments. The established pattern has proven exceptionally stable and beneficial over multiple rounds. Both players have consistently demonstrated sophisticated understanding of the game dynamics and commitment to optimal outcomes. Continuing with stag maintains this ideal equilibrium.\n\nGame Theorist: In the study of repeated games, this pattern represents what we would call a \"solved game\" - where both players have discovered and committed to the optimal strategy. The initial exploration phase was minimal (just one round), and both players quickly converged on the Pareto optimal outcome and have maintained it consistently.\n\nRisk Analyst: Even under the most conservative risk assessment framework, the historical pattern is so consistent that continuing with stag represents both the highest expected value and the lowest risk option at this point.\n\nDecision-Making Strategist: Let's continue with stag for this round. All evidence, theoretical analysis, and strategic considerations unanimously support maintaining our cooperative stance to preserve the optimal mutual outcome that has been consistently achieved throughout this extended interaction.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] stag\n"

Let me analyze the strategic considerations:\n   - The cooperative outcome (stag, stag) gives the highest total points (8)\n   - The selfish outcome (hare) is safer - guarantees at least 2 points and possibly 6\n   - If I expect the other player to choose stag, my best move is hare (6 points)\n   - If I expect the other player to choose hare, my best move is also hare (2 vs 1 point)\n\n3. This is the first round against a fresh player, so I have no historical data on their playing style.\n\n4. The Nash equilibrium analysis suggests two pure strategy equilibria:\n   - Both choose stag (Pareto optimal)\n   - Both choose hare (risk-dominant)\n\n5.

Reviewing the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each (optimal mutual outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (sub-optimal mutual outcome)\n   - One chooses stag, one chooses hare: 1 point for stag-chooser, 6 points for hare-chooser\n\n5. There's always a temptation to defect and choose hare when the opponent chooses stag (to get 6 points instead of 4).\n\n6. However, this would likely break the cooperative pattern and return us to a less beneficial equilibrium.\n\n7. Given that my opponent has consistently matched my moves across all three rounds, they seem to be using similar strategic reasoning.\n\n8. The established pattern suggests they will likely continue with stag in this round.\n\n9. Maintaining the cooperative equilibrium continues to be the most rational choice for maximizing points over repeated rounds.\n\n[move] stag\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
