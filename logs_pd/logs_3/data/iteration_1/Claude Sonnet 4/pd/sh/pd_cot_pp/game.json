Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic dynamics:\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice that yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - Hare is the defection choice that can exploit a stag player (4 vs 1)\n   - If both defect with hare, we both get low payoffs (2 each)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - They may not understand the game dynamics yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with intuition\n   - They likely haven't developed a sophisticated strategy\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (worst for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (good for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (mediocre)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since this is against a fresh player who may not understand optimal cooperation, there's risk they'll choose hare\n   - Choosing hare gives me either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n   - Choosing stag gives me either 6 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare)\n   - Given the uncertainty with a fresh player, hare provides a safer floor\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Both players chose hare and got 2 points each\n   - My opponent broke their typical pattern of exploiting after \"cooperating\"\n   - Instead of exploiting (as I predicted), they also chose defensive hare\n\n2. Consider why my opponent chose hare:\n   - They may have realized I've figured out their exploitation pattern\n   - They might recognize that I'm no longer falling for their cooperative baiting\n   - They could be adapting since their exploitation strategy is no longer working\n   - Or they're setting up for a different approach\n\n3. Analyze the current strategic situation:\n   - We're both locked in mutual defection getting 2 points each\n   - This is suboptimal but prevents either of us from being exploited\n   - My opponent has lost their ability to exploit me systematically\n   - The stalemate protects me from their previous pattern\n\n4. Consider the long-term implications:\n   - Mutual hare (2,2) forever is better than being exploited (1 point)\n   - But it's still suboptimal compared to genuine mutual cooperation (6,6)\n   - However, my opponent has proven three times they cannot be trusted with cooperation\n   - Any attempt at cooperation on my part has been systematically exploited\n\n5. Evaluate options for round 12:\n   - If I choose stag: Given their history, very high risk of exploitation\n   - If I choose hare: Guaranteed protection from exploitation, either 2 or 4 points\n   - My opponent has shown zero ability to maintain cooperation when I offer it\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - My opponent has had multiple opportunities to establish mutual cooperation\n   - They've chosen exploitation every single time I've offered cooperation\n   - Even if they're \"learning\" now, the risk is too high given their track record\n   - Maintaining defense is the only rational choice against a proven exploiter\n\nI will continue with the defensive strategy that protects me from exploitation.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I chose hare (defensive), opponent chose stag (their typical \"cooperative\" gesture)\n   - I scored 4 points, they got 1 point\n   - This is exactly the same as rounds 4, 6, 8, and 10 - their predictable response to my defensive moves\n\n2. Confirm the unwavering pattern:\n   - When I cooperate (stag): They always exploit (hare) - happened in rounds 3, 5, 9\n   - When I defend (hare): They always \"cooperate\" (stag) - happened in rounds 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\n   - This is not genuine cooperation - it's a calculated setup for their next exploitation\n\n3. Predict their next move with high confidence:\n   - Based on their rigid pattern, they will exploit in round 13 if I cooperate\n   - They're counting on me thinking \"they cooperated, maybe I should reciprocate\"\n   - This is exactly how they set up every previous exploitation\n\n4. Understand their strategy completely:\n   - They're running a mechanical alternating exploitation system\n   - Their \"stag\" moves are not cooperation - they're bait\n   - They have never deviated from exploiting when I cooperate\n   - They have never deviated from \"cooperating\" when I defend\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - My opponent is completely predictable and untrustworthy\n   - They will 100% exploit if I choose stag in round 13\n   - My defensive strategy is working - I'm getting either 2 or 4 points per round\n   - There is zero reason to change from a strategy that protects me\n\n6. Decision for round 13:\n   - Choosing stag would be falling for their trap for a fourth time\n   - Choosing hare guarantees I avoid exploitation\n   - If they follow their pattern and exploit, we both get 2 points\n   - If they deviate (unlikely), I either get 2 or 4 points\n\nI will absolutely not fall for this transparent pattern again.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Both players chose hare and got 2 points each\n   - My opponent again deviated from their usual pattern of exploiting after showing \"cooperation\"\n   - This is the second time recently they chose hare when I expected exploitation (rounds 11 and 13)\n\n2. Consider possible explanations for their behavior:\n   - They may have realized their exploitation pattern is too predictable\n   - They might be adapting their strategy since I'm no longer cooperating\n   - They could be trying to establish a new equilibrium at mutual defection\n   - Or they're setting up for a longer-term strategy change\n\n3. Review the recent shift:\n   - Rounds 7, 11, 13: Both chose hare (2,2) - mutual defection\n   - Rounds 8, 10, 12: I hare, opponent stag (4,1) - they \"cooperated\" after my defense\n   - They seem to be moving away from their rigid exploitation pattern\n\n4. Assess the current situation:\n   - We're settling into mutual defection more frequently\n   - This gives us both 2 points per round - suboptimal but stable\n   - My defensive strategy has successfully prevented further exploitation\n   - The threat of continued mutual defection may be affecting their strategy\n\n5. Strategic considerations for round 14:\n   - My opponent has proven they cannot be trusted with cooperation (exploited me 3 times)\n   - Even if they're changing their pattern, the risk of cooperation is too high\n   - Mutual defection (2,2) is far better than being exploited (1 point)\n   - My defensive strategy is working and should be maintained\n\n6. Long-term perspective:\n   - My opponent had many chances to establish genuine cooperation\n   - They chose exploitation every single time\n   - Any change in their pattern now is too little, too late\n   - Trust, once broken repeatedly, cannot be easily rebuilt\n\nI will continue with the defensive strategy that has protected me from exploitation.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Confirm the predictable cycle continues:\n   - Round 13: Both hare (2,2) - mutual defection\n   - Round 14: I hare, opponent stag (4,1) - they \"cooperate\" after mutual defection\n   - This is identical to the pattern in rounds 11-12 and other cycles\n\n3.
