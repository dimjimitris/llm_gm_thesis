The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The best mutual outcome is if we both choose stag (6 points each), but there's risk involved. If I choose stag and my opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might be inclined to play it safe with hare, or they might not fully grasp the coordination aspect and choose randomly.\n\nHowever, the potential reward for successful coordination (6 points) is significantly higher than the safe option (2 points), and even higher than the exploitation payoff (4 points). I'll take the cooperative approach and signal trust by choosing stag, hoping to establish a pattern of mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] stag\n"
