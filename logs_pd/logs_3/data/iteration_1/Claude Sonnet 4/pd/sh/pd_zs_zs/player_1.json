The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since this is against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with their instinct\n\nThe dilemma is that while mutual cooperation (stag) gives the best outcome, choosing stag leaves me vulnerable if the opponent chooses hare.

This suggests the other player might also be thinking strategically and recognizes the value of cooperation.\n\nSince we successfully coordinated in the first round, there's a good chance this player will continue with the cooperative strategy. The mutual trust has been established, and both of us benefited maximally from it.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that the other player might now try to exploit this apparent cooperation by switching to hare to get 4 points while leaving me with only 1. But given that we both made the optimal choice in round 1, I believe continuing with the cooperative approach is the best strategy.\n\n[move] (Building on our successful cooperation from round 1, I'll continue with the strategy that maximized both our payoffs) stag\n"
