    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The key insight is that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest joint payoff and highest individual payoff when successful. However, it's risky because if the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might either:\n1. Choose randomly\n2. Play conservatively (hare for guaranteed minimum 2 points)\n3. Try to cooperate (stag for potential 6 points)\n\nGiven that this appears to be an opening move and fresh players often start with cooperative intentions before learning to be more strategic, I'll choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] I choose stag, aiming for the cooperative solution that benefits both players maximally.\n"

This suggests my opponent is also thinking cooperatively and understands the mutual benefit of coordination.\n\nSince we successfully coordinated in the first round, there's a good chance this player will continue with the cooperative strategy. The fact that they chose stag initially indicates they're willing to take the risk for the higher payoff, rather than playing it safe with hare.\n\nI should continue with stag to maintain this successful coordination pattern, as it maximizes both our points when we both cooperate.\n\n[move] (Building on our successful coordination from the previous round) stag\n"
