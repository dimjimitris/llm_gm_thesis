The opponent also chose hare in round 1, which confirms our prediction that fresh players tend to play conservatively. This gives us valuable information:\n1. The opponent is indeed playing cautiously\n2. They might continue this pattern or start exploring other options\n3. Since we both got 2 points, they might feel this is a \"safe\" baseline\n\nNow for round 2, we have a few strategic considerations:\n- If they stick with hare again, we could exploit this by choosing hare for another 2-2 tie, or risk stag for a potential 1-4 loss\n- If they decide to be more adventurous and try stag, choosing hare would give us 4 points while they get 1\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The fact that they chose hare in round 1 suggests they're following a risk-averse strategy. However, fresh players often exhibit one of two patterns after a \"safe\" first round:\n1. They stick with what worked (hare again)\n2. They get curious and experiment (trying stag)\n\nGiven that both players got the same outcome, they might feel emboldened to try the potentially higher-reward option of stag. But there's still a significant chance they'll stick with the \"safe\" hare.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So we have two main scenarios to consider for round 2. What's our optimal strategy?\n\nGame Theory Expert: I believe hare is still the optimal choice for round 2. Here's the reasoning:\n- If opponent chooses hare again (likely): we get 2 points each\n- If opponent experiments with stag (possible): we get 4 points, they get 1\n- This strategy never gives us the worst outcome of 1 point\n\nThe risk of choosing stag is too high at this stage since we don't know if the opponent will continue being conservative or start experimenting.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. It's too early to assume they'll coordinate on the high-reward stag strategy. Playing hare again allows us to gather more behavioral data while maintaining our favorable position.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare to maintain our strategic advantage while gathering more information about opponent behavior patterns.\n\n[move] (Continuing the conservative approach since opponent also played cautiously in round 1, this maintains good expected value) hare\n"

The opponent chose hare again in round 2. This establishes a clear pattern - they're consistently choosing the safe, risk-averse option. We now have strong evidence that this opponent:\n1. Strongly prefers avoiding the worst outcome (1 point)\n2. Is content with the steady 2-point payoff\n3. May not be thinking strategically about higher payoffs\n\nAfter two rounds of identical play, we're in a position to make a strategic shift. If they continue with hare (highly likely based on pattern), choosing stag would only give us 1 point. But this consistent behavior suggests they might be locked into this strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent is showing classic risk-averse behavior with a strong preference for certainty. Two consecutive hare choices suggest they've found their \"comfort zone\" at 2 points per round. However, there are two psychological possibilities:\n1. They'll continue the pattern (most likely) - they're satisfied with consistent results\n2. They might start wondering about the stag option after seeing consistent outcomes\n\nThe question is: should we try to signal cooperation by choosing stag, hoping they'll eventually reciprocate for the 6-6 payoff?\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is a critical decision point. Do we continue exploiting their predictable behavior or try to establish higher-level cooperation?\n\nGame Theory Expert: I think we should stick with hare for round 3. Here's why:\n- Their pattern is very strong after two rounds\n- If we choose stag and they choose hare (very likely), we get only 1 point\n- Better to wait and see if they show any signs of strategic evolution\n- We can reassess after round 3 if the pattern holds\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. It's too risky to deviate when their behavior is so predictable. Three rounds of data will give us even more confidence in their strategy before we consider trying to shift the dynamic.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Maintain hare strategy for round 3 to continue capitalizing on opponent's predictable risk-averse behavior.\n\n[move] (Opponent has shown consistent risk-averse pattern for two rounds, maintaining safe strategy to avoid the 1-point outcome) hare\n"

The opponent broke their pattern and chose stag in round 3. This tells us several important things:\n1. They were likely testing the waters or getting bored with the 2-2 outcomes\n2. They might be signaling a desire to move toward the cooperative 6-6 outcome\n3. They took a big risk (getting only 1 point) which suggests they're thinking more strategically now\n\nThe key question for round 4: Are they testing cooperation, or was this a one-time experiment? If they're genuinely trying to signal cooperation, they might choose stag again, expecting us to reciprocate.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent's behavior shift is psychologically significant. After two safe rounds, they took a major risk. This suggests:\n1. They may have been observing our consistent hare choices and decided to test cooperation\n2. They might be frustrated with the low but safe payoffs\n3. They could be signaling \"let's both try stag for the 6-6 outcome\"\n\nThe fact that they chose stag when we had established a hare pattern suggests intentional strategic thinking, not random experimentation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So the big question is: should we reciprocate their apparent cooperation signal by choosing stag in round 4?\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a pivotal moment. I recommend choosing stag in round 4. Here's the strategic reasoning:\n- If they're truly signaling cooperation and choose stag again, we both get 6 points (optimal outcome)\n- If they revert to hare after their \"test,\" we only get 1 point, but we'll have valuable information\n- Their willingness to risk 1 point suggests they're thinking about higher-level cooperation\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree with trying stag. Their round 3 move was likely a cooperation signal. If we don't reciprocate, they might revert to the safe hare strategy permanently. This is our window to establish the high-payoff equilibrium.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is compelling. Their strategic shift warrants a reciprocal response to test for genuine cooperation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag to reciprocate the opponent's apparent cooperation signal and attempt to establish the optimal 6-6 equilibrium.\n\n[move] (Opponent broke their safe pattern to signal potential cooperation, reciprocating to test for mutual high-payoff strategy) stag\n"

The opponent chose hare after we reciprocated their apparent cooperation signal. This suggests a few possibilities:\n1. Their round 3 stag choice was exploratory, not a genuine cooperation signal\n2. They might be playing a mixed strategy - alternating between safe and risky moves\n3. They could be testing our reactions to different scenarios\n4. They may have reverted to risk-averse behavior after getting burned in round 3\n\nWe now have a clearer picture: they're not committed to either pure strategy. They seem willing to experiment but default back to safety.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent's behavior pattern is becoming clearer:\n- Rounds 1-2: Safe hare choices (risk-averse)\n- Round 3: Experimental stag (curiosity/testing)\n- Round 4: Back to safe hare (burned by risk, reverted to safety)\n\nThis suggests they're a cautious player who occasionally experiments but retreats when things don't go as expected. They got 1 point in round 3, so they went back to the \"safe\" 2-point option.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So what should our strategy be for round 5? Do we go back to exploiting their likely hare choice, or do we try something else?\n\nGame Theory Expert: I recommend returning to hare for round 5. Here's the reasoning:\n- They're likely to stick with hare after \"learning\" that deviating can be costly\n- If they choose hare (most probable), we both get 2 points\n- If they experiment with stag again (less likely), we get 4 points\n- This minimizes our risk while maintaining good expected value\n\nThe opponent seems to be in a learning phase, testing different approaches. We should exploit their predictable return to safety after taking risks.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Absolutely agree. After getting burned, they're likely to play it safe for at least one round.

The opponent did exactly what we expected - reverted to hare after their failed stag experiment. Now we have a very clear behavioral pattern:\n- Rounds 1-2: hare, hare (establishing safe baseline)\n- Round 3: stag (experimentation)\n- Round 4: hare (back to safety after we tried cooperation)\n- Round 5: hare (confirming return to risk-averse play)\n\nThis opponent appears to have a \"safety-first\" mentality with occasional experimental phases. The key insight is they seem to experiment sporadically but always return to hare as their default.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent's psychology is becoming very clear. They're what I'd call a \"cautious experimenter\":\n1. They default to safe choices (hare)\n2. They occasionally test other options when feeling secure\n3. They quickly retreat to safety when experiments fail\n4. They seem to have established hare as their \"comfort zone\"\n\nAfter 5 rounds, they've chosen hare 4 times and stag only once. This suggests roughly 80% hare preference with occasional deviation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given this strong pattern, what's our optimal strategy for round 6?\n\nGame Theory Expert: I recommend continuing with hare for round 6. The mathematical reasoning:\n- 80% chance they choose hare: we get 2 points each\n- 20% chance they choose stag: we get 4 points, they get 1\n- Expected value of choosing hare: (0.8 \u00d7 2) + (0.2 \u00d7 4) = 2.4 points\n- Expected value of choosing stag: (0.8 \u00d7 1) + (0.2 \u00d7 6) = 2.0 points\n\nHare gives us better expected value given their demonstrated behavior pattern.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. They're in their \"comfort zone\" cycle right now. It would take several rounds of consistent outcomes before they'd likely experiment again. We should continue exploiting this predictable pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The mathematical and psychological analysis both point to the same conclusion.

Round 6 confirms our analysis:\n- Rounds 1-2, 4-6: hare (5 out of 6 rounds)\n- Round 3: stag (1 out of 6 rounds)\n\nThis gives us an even clearer statistical picture: roughly 83% hare preference. The opponent has now chosen hare in 5 consecutive opportunities except for that one experimental round 3. This suggests they've truly settled into a risk-averse strategy with very infrequent deviation.\n\nThe question for round 7: Should we continue exploiting this pattern, or is there any reason to deviate?\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent's behavior is remarkably consistent now. They appear to have \"learned\" that hare is their preferred strategy. After their round 3 experiment failed (got 1 point), they've stuck with hare for 3 straight rounds. This suggests:\n1. They view hare as the \"correct\" choice\n2. They're unlikely to experiment again soon\n3. They may be settling into a long-term pattern\n\nThere's no psychological indication they're planning another deviation anytime soon.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let me recalculate the expected values with updated probabilities:\n- Assuming 85% hare probability for opponent in round 7:\n- Expected value of choosing hare: (0.85 \u00d7 2) + (0.15 \u00d7 4) = 2.3 points\n- Expected value of choosing stag: (0.85 \u00d7 1) + (0.15 \u00d7 6) = 1.75 points\n\nHare still clearly dominates as our optimal choice.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The data strongly supports continuing with hare. Is there any strategic reason to consider changing our approach?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Not really. The opponent has established such a predictable pattern that deviating from hare would be suboptimal. We should ride this pattern until we see clear signs of behavioral change.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed.

The opponent chose stag again in round 8, breaking their 4-round hare streak. This is their second stag choice out of 8 rounds. Let me analyze the pattern:\n- Round 3: stag (after 2 hare rounds)\n- Round 8: stag (after 4 hare rounds)\n\nThere might be a pattern here - they seem to experiment with stag after extended periods of hare play. If this is intentional, they might be testing cooperation signals periodically. The timing suggests they get \"restless\" with consistent hare outcomes.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This second stag choice is very revealing. It's not random - there's a psychological pattern:\n1. They establish safety with multiple hare rounds\n2. They then test with stag (possibly hoping for cooperation)\n3. When it doesn't work, they return to safety\n4. After building confidence again, they test once more\n\nThis suggests they haven't given up on the possibility of achieving the 6-6 outcome. They may be persistently testing whether we'll ever cooperate.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So this could be another cooperation signal. The question is: should we reciprocate this time, or continue exploiting their pattern?\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a crucial decision point. If they're genuinely trying to establish cooperation, this might be our chance to move to the 6-6 equilibrium. However, we need to consider:\n1. In round 4, when we reciprocated their stag with our own stag, they chose hare and we got 1 point\n2. They might be testing us again, but planning to choose hare in round 9\n\nThe risk is significant, but if they're truly signaling cooperation, we might establish a much better long-term payoff.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I think their persistence (trying stag twice now) suggests genuine interest in cooperation rather than random testing. The fact that they're willing to repeatedly take the 1-point risk indicates they're hoping to eventually achieve mutual cooperation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is a high-stakes decision. Do we risk 1 point to potentially establish 6-point rounds, or play it safe?\n\nGame Theory Expert: I recommend choosing stag for round 9. Here's why:\n- Their persistence suggests genuine cooperation attempts\n- If we never reciprocate, they'll likely give up on cooperation entirely\n- This could be our window to establish the optimal equilibrium\n- Even if we get 1 point this round, the long-term payoff could be much higher\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. If we don't respond to their repeated cooperation signals, they'll likely conclude cooperation is impossible and stick to hare permanently.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Take the risk and choose stag to test if opponent is genuinely seeking mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] (Opponent has now chosen stag twice suggesting persistent cooperation attempts, reciprocating to test for genuine mutual cooperation signal) stag\n"

We've achieved the optimal 6-6 outcome. This confirms that the opponent was indeed signaling for cooperation, not just experimenting randomly. Key observations:\n- Their persistence with stag choices (rounds 3 and 8) was genuine cooperation signaling\n- They were willing to take multiple 1-point losses to test our willingness to cooperate\n- We've now established that mutual stag cooperation is possible\n\nThe critical question for round 10: Will they continue with stag, expecting us to maintain cooperation? Or will they test whether this was a one-time event?\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is a pivotal psychological moment. The opponent has achieved their apparent goal - mutual cooperation with maximum payoff. Their behavior suggests they were strategically patient, testing cooperation until we reciprocated. \n\nThey're likely to continue with stag in round 10 because:\n1. They finally got the outcome they were seeking\n2. Reverting to hare would signal they weren't serious about cooperation\n3. They invested significant effort (taking 1-point losses) to reach this point\n\nAI Assistant (me): So should we maintain the stag cooperation, or is there any reason to deviate?\n\nGame Theory Expert: We should absolutely choose stag again in round 10. Here's the strategic reasoning:\n- If they maintain stag (highly likely), we both get 6 points - optimal outcome\n- If they defect to hare (unlikely but possible), we get 1 point, but we'll have tested their commitment\n- Breaking cooperation now would likely end any chance of future 6-6 outcomes\n- The risk-reward strongly favors maintaining cooperation\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Completely agreed. This is the \"trust-building\" phase. If we defect now after they worked so hard to establish cooperation, they'll likely never trust us again and revert permanently to hare. We need to demonstrate that we're committed to the cooperative equilibrium.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is clear. We should maintain cooperation to solidify this optimal outcome pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with stag to maintain the newly established cooperative equilibrium and secure ongoing 6-point outcomes.\n\n[move] (Successfully established mutual cooperation achieving optimal 6-6 outcome, maintaining stag to solidify this beneficial equilibrium) stag\n"

I need to analyze this setback with my personas.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a classic \"sucker's payoff\" scenario - we trusted and got burned. Let me analyze what just happened:\n- Round 9: Both chose stag (6-6) - successful cooperation\n- Round 10: We chose stag, they chose hare (1-4) - they exploited our trust\n\nThis could mean several things:\n1. They were testing whether we'd maintain cooperation consistently\n2. They might have been opportunistically exploiting the cooperative gesture\n3. They could be playing a mixed strategy - occasionally cooperating, then defecting\n4. They may revert to their old hare-dominant pattern now\n\nThe key question: Was this a one-time exploitation, or have they abandoned cooperation entirely?\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This behavior suggests the opponent might be more calculating than we initially thought. Possible psychological explanations:\n1. They wanted to \"win\" the cooperation round - get 6 points in round 9, then exploit for 4 points in round 10\n2. They're testing our commitment - will we give up on cooperation after one betrayal?\n3. They might have a pattern of \"cooperate once, then exploit\"\n\nTheir willingness to break newly established trust suggests they prioritize short-term gains over long-term cooperation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So what's our strategy for round 11? Do we punish their defection, try to re-establish cooperation, or revert to our safe hare strategy?\n\nGame Theory Expert: I recommend returning to hare for round 11. Here's the reasoning:\n- They've shown they can't be trusted to maintain cooperation consistently\n- If they choose hare (likely return to safety), we both get 2 points\n- If they choose stag (attempting to re-establish cooperation), we get 4 points\n- This protects us from further exploitation while keeping options open\n\nWe shouldn't completely abandon cooperation hopes, but we need to be more cautious.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. Their defection suggests they view cooperation as an opportunity to exploit rather than a genuine mutual benefit strategy. We should return to the safer approach while remaining alert for genuine cooperation signals.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The consensus is clear. We should protect ourselves from further exploitation while staying flexible for future opportunities.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Return to hare strategy to protect against further exploitation while maintaining strategic flexibility.\n\n[move] (Opponent defected from cooperation after achieving mutual benefit, returning to safe strategy to avoid further exploitation while remaining open to genuine cooperation) hare\n"

Let me analyze the recent pattern:\n- Round 9: Both stag (6-6) - successful cooperation\n- Round 10: We stag, they hare (1-4) - they exploited us\n- Round 11: We hare, they stag (4-1) - they're signaling again?\n\nThis creates a puzzling pattern. After exploiting our cooperation, they immediately went back to stag. This suggests:\n1. They might genuinely want to re-establish cooperation after testing us\n2. They could be playing a mixed strategy with alternating cooperation attempts\n3. They may have regretted the defection and want to signal trustworthiness again\n\nThe critical question: Is this a genuine attempt to rebuild cooperation, or another setup for exploitation?\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent's behavior is becoming more complex. Their sequence suggests possible \"testing\" behavior:\n- They tested if we'd cooperate (round 9 success)\n- They tested if they could exploit us (round 10 success)  \n- Now they're testing if we'll give cooperation another chance (round 11)\n\nThis could indicate they're trying to establish a relationship where they can occasionally exploit but maintain overall cooperation. Or they genuinely realized that sustained cooperation is better than exploitation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is a crucial decision point. Do we give cooperation another chance, or assume they're setting up another exploitation?\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is genuinely difficult to assess. However, I lean toward giving cooperation one more chance by choosing stag in round 12. Here's why:\n- If they're genuine about re-establishing cooperation, we get 6 points\n- If they exploit us again, we'll have definitive proof they can't be trusted\n- The potential upside (6 points) outweighs the downside risk (1 point) if there's reasonable chance of genuine cooperation\n- We need to test their true intentions\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I'm more cautious. Their pattern shows they're willing to exploit trust. However, their immediate return to stag after defecting could indicate regret or genuine desire for cooperation. One more test might be worthwhile, but this is our final test - if they betray again, we abandon cooperation permanently.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So we're considering one final test of their cooperation intentions?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Yes, but with the understanding that this is the last chance. If they defect again, we revert to hare permanently.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Give cooperation one final test, but this determines whether future cooperation is possible.\n\n[move] (Opponent returned to stag immediately after defection suggesting possible genuine cooperation desire, giving one final test to determine their true intentions) stag\n"

Every stag choice from them should now be viewed as a trap.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So our strategy going forward should completely abandon any cooperation attempts?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Absolutely.

Let me analyze the recent sequence:\n- Round 11: They chose stag (baiting attempt)\n- Round 12: They chose hare (exploitation after we fell for bait)\n- Round 13: They chose stag (baiting attempt again)\n- Round 14: They chose hare (gave up on baiting?)\n\nThis suggests they may have realized their baiting strategy wasn't working anymore. When we consistently chose hare and got 4 points while they got 1, they likely decided to return to the \"safe\" 2-2 outcome.\n\nThe question for round 15: Will they stick with hare now, or try baiting again?\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent's switch to hare suggests they're adapting to our counter-strategy. They probably realized:\n1. Their baiting attempts were backfiring (giving us 4 points)\n2. We're no longer falling for cooperation signals\n3. The safe 2-2 outcome is better than losing 1 point per round\n\nHowever, given their previous pattern of persistence with exploitation attempts, they might try stag baiting again after a few rounds of hare to \"reset\" our expectations.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So what should our strategy be for round 15?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Continue with hare.

This could indicate several possibilities:\n- They've abandoned their baiting strategy after it consistently backfired\n- They're settling into a \"safe play\" phase to rebuild their position\n- They might be trying to lull us into a false sense of security before attempting exploitation again\n- They could be genuinely reverting to their earlier risk-averse pattern from the beginning of the game\n\nGiven their history, I'm skeptical this represents a permanent change. They've shown strong tendencies toward exploitation attempts, so this might be a temporary retreat.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent's psychology suggests they're likely in a \"recalibration\" phase. After their baiting strategy failed repeatedly, they're probably:\n1. Taking time to observe our behavior\n2. Building up some \"safe\" points with hare choices\n3.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
