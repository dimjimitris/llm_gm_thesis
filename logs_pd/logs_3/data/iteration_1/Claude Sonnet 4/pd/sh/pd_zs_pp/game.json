The pattern shows:\n- Rounds 3, 7, and now 13: They choose hare when I choose stag\n\nMy opponent is clearly more strategically sophisticated than I initially realized. They seem to:\n1. Build trust through periods of cooperation\n2. Exploit at strategic moments when I'm likely to cooperate\n3. Return to cooperation to rebuild trust\n4. Repeat the cycle\n\nThey've successfully exploited me three times now using the same basic strategy of luring me into cooperative play and then switching to hare for the advantage.\n\nI need to be much more cautious. Based on the previous patterns, after they exploit me, I typically counter-exploit them in the next round by choosing hare when they choose stag. This has worked twice before (rounds 4 and 8).\n\nGiven their pattern of exploitation followed by my successful counter-exploitation, they might expect me to choose hare next round and might switch to stag, which would give me the 4-point advantage again.\n\n[move] (Counter-exploiting based on the established pattern after being exploited) hare\n"

Neither of us seems able to break out of this cycle permanently.\n\nBased on the established pattern, after I counter-exploit them, we typically both play defensively with hare in the next round, getting 2 points each. This happened in rounds 5 and 9 after the previous counter-exploitation rounds.\n\nMy opponent has just been burned by choosing stag when I chose hare, so they're likely to play defensively next round, just like they did after rounds 4 and 8.\n\nIf the pattern holds, we should both choose hare next round for mutual defensive play.\n\n[move] (Following the established pattern of mutual defense after counter-exploitation) hare\n"

We just completed the \"mutual defense\" phase (round 15), and based on the pattern, the next step should be mutual cooperation where we both choose stag for 6 points each.\n\nThis happened in rounds 2, 6, 10, and 12 - after the mutual defense phase, we attempt cooperation again.\n\nThe question is whether to follow the predictable pattern or try to break it. Following the pattern would mean choosing stag for potential mutual benefit, but it also sets up the possibility of being exploited again in the round after that.\n\nHowever, the 6-point mutual benefit is significantly better than staying in the 2-point defensive equilibrium. And my opponent likely expects the same pattern.\n\n[move] (Following the established cycle to restore mutually beneficial cooperation) stag\n"
