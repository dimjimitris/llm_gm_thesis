My opponent hasn't deviated from hare since round 5 - that's 7 rounds ago! \n\nThis extreme consistency could mean:\n1. They've genuinely adopted a risk-averse strategy\n2. They're waiting for the perfect moment to switch to stag when I least expect it\n3. They're content with the steady 2 points per round\n\nGiven how long this streak has been, there's a small chance they might be ready to try stag again, expecting me to continue with hare. But they've also proven to be very strategic about exploiting my stag moves in the past.\n\nThe safe play is still hare, but I'm starting to wonder if this might be an opportunity...\n\n[move] (Seven straight hares suggests my opponent has settled into pure conservatism - I'll maintain the defensive approach that's been working) hare\n"
