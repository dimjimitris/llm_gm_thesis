This is mechanical, robotic consistency.\n\nAt this point, I'm genuinely curious about something. What would happen if I chose stag? Not because I think they'll choose stag - they won't, based on 15 rounds of evidence - but just to see if there's any reaction at all.\n\nBut that's not rational thinking. That's just boredom with the predictable pattern. The math is crystal clear:\n- They will choose hare (100% certainty based on behavior)\n- If I choose stag: I get 1 point\n- If I choose hare: I get 2 points\n\nThrowing away a guaranteed point just for curiosity would be irrational. Their strategy is completely fixed. The optimal counter-strategy is equally fixed.\n\nEven though this equilibrium feels stagnant, it's the mathematically correct choice.\n\n[move] hare\n"
