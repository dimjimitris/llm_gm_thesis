If they continue with stag (showing genuine cooperative intent), and I also choose stag, we both get the maximum mutual benefit of 6 points each. However, if they revert to hare thinking I'll choose stag, I'd get exploited again.\n\nGiven that they switched to the cooperative move after seeing the results of round 1, I think there's a good chance they're trying to establish mutual cooperation.
