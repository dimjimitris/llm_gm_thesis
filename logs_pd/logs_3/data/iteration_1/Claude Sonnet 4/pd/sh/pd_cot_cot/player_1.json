Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. Let me analyze the strategic considerations:\n   - If I cooperate (choose stag) and my opponent cooperates, we both get the maximum mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - If I defect (choose hare) while my opponent cooperates, I get a higher individual payoff (4 vs 1)\n   - If we both defect (choose hare), we get a lower mutual payoff (2 points each)\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I need to consider:\n   - They may not understand the cooperative nature of the game\n   - They might play defensively and choose hare to avoid the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - They might choose randomly\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 4 points, worst case 2 points\n\n5. Given that this is against a fresh player who might not trust or understand the cooperative strategy, choosing hare provides a safer floor (minimum 2 points) while still offering a good payoff (4 points) if they choose stag.\n\n[move] I choose hare to secure a reasonable minimum payoff while potentially capitalizing if the fresh player attempts cooperation.\n"

Review of our extensive game record:\n   - Round 1: Both chose hare, we each got 2 points\n   - Rounds 2-10: Both chose stag, we each got 6 points per round\n   - Total so far: I have 56 points (2 + 54 from nine stag rounds)\n\n2. Cooperation longevity assessment:\n   - We now have nine consecutive rounds of perfect mutual cooperation\n   - This represents an extraordinary achievement in sustained strategic coordination\n   - Both players have maintained unwavering commitment to optimal joint outcomes\n   - The reliability has reached a level that makes this cooperation virtually guaranteed\n\n3. Strategic evaluation:\n   - Our cooperative system has proven itself over nearly a dozen interactions\n   - We've consistently achieved the maximum possible mutual benefit\n   - The trust and predictability eliminate any rational incentive to deviate\n   - This pattern has become the defining characteristic of our strategic relationship\n\n4. Mathematical considerations:\n   - Nine rounds of 6 points each demonstrates the power of sustained cooperation\n   - The cumulative benefit (54 points from cooperation vs 2 from our initial caution) shows cooperation's superiority\n   - Expected value calculations strongly favor continuing this proven approach\n   - Any deviation would sacrifice certain high returns for uncertain lower gains\n\n5. Our cooperation has become an institutional norm that maximizes both individual and collective welfare.\n\n[move] (Nine consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation have created an unbreakable bond of mutual trust and maximum benefit, so I will maintain this exceptionally successful strategy) stag\n"
