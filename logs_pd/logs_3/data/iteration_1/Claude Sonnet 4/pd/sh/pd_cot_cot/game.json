First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. Let me analyze the strategic considerations:\n   - If I expect the opponent to choose stag, I should choose stag (6 > 4)\n   - If I expect the opponent to choose hare, I should choose hare (2 > 1)\n\n3. Since this is a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), I need to consider their likely behavior:\n   - Fresh players might be risk-averse and choose the safer option\n   - Hare is the safer choice because it guarantees at least 2 points regardless of opponent's move\n   - Stag is riskier but offers the highest mutual payoff\n\n4. However, choosing stag requires trust/coordination. With a fresh player, there's uncertainty about their strategic thinking.\n\n5. The key insight: If both players are rational and can communicate/coordinate, stag is optimal. But in a one-shot game with uncertainty, hare might be the safer choice.\n\n6. Given that this is against a fresh player who may not fully grasp the coordination aspect, I should consider that they might default to the safer hare option.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare to secure a reasonable payoff while protecting against the risk of getting only 1 point.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Previous round results:\n   - Both players chose hare\n   - We both got 2 points each\n   - This confirms the opponent also chose the \"safe\" strategy\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also recognized hare as the safer option\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me about risk management\n   - They're capable of strategic thinking (chose the risk-averse option)\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - Since we both chose hare last time, there's now a basis for potential coordination\n   - The opponent showed they can think strategically\n   - There might be an opportunity to signal cooperation toward the mutually beneficial stag option\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare again: I get 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points, they get 1\n   - If we both choose hare again: We both get 2 points (safe but suboptimal)\n\n5. The key question: Should I try to coordinate toward the better mutual outcome (stag-stag) or play it safe again?\n\n6. Since the opponent demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing hare in round 1, they might also recognize that mutual cooperation (stag-stag) is better than mutual defection (hare-hare).\n\nFinal decision: I'll take a calculated risk and choose stag to signal cooperation and attempt to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] stag\n"

What this pattern reveals about my opponent:\n   - They're capable of strategic evolution and learning\n   - They followed the same logic I did: start safe, then cooperate\n   - They successfully coordinated with me to achieve mutual benefit\n   - They seem to understand the value of cooperation\n\n3.
