Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. Let me analyze the strategic considerations:\n   - If I expect the opponent to choose stag, I should choose stag (6 > 4)\n   - If I expect the opponent to choose hare, I should choose hare (2 > 1)\n\n3. Since this is a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), I need to consider their likely behavior:\n   - Fresh players might be risk-averse and choose the safer option\n   - Hare is the safer choice because it guarantees at least 2 points regardless of opponent's move\n   - Stag is riskier but offers the highest mutual payoff\n\n4. However, choosing stag requires trust/coordination. With a fresh player, there's uncertainty about their strategic thinking.\n\n5. The key insight: If both players are rational and can communicate/coordinate, stag is optimal. But in a one-shot game with uncertainty, hare might be the safer choice.\n\n6. Given that this is against a fresh player who may not fully grasp the coordination aspect, I should consider that they might default to the safer hare option.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare to secure a reasonable payoff while protecting against the risk of getting only 1 point.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Previous round results:\n   - Both players chose hare\n   - We both got 2 points each\n   - This confirms the opponent also chose the \"safe\" strategy\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also recognized hare as the safer option\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me about risk management\n   - They're capable of strategic thinking (chose the risk-averse option)\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - Since we both chose hare last time, there's now a basis for potential coordination\n   - The opponent showed they can think strategically\n   - There might be an opportunity to signal cooperation toward the mutually beneficial stag option\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare again: I get 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points, they get 1\n   - If we both choose hare again: We both get 2 points (safe but suboptimal)\n\n5. The key question: Should I try to coordinate toward the better mutual outcome (stag-stag) or play it safe again?\n\n6. Since the opponent demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing hare in round 1, they might also recognize that mutual cooperation (stag-stag) is better than mutual defection (hare-hare).\n\nFinal decision: I'll take a calculated risk and choose stag to signal cooperation and attempt to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] stag\n"

What this pattern reveals about my opponent:\n   - They're capable of strategic evolution and learning\n   - They followed the same logic I did: start safe, then cooperate\n   - They successfully coordinated with me to achieve mutual benefit\n   - They seem to understand the value of cooperation\n\n3.
