The key insights are:\n1. Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint payoff (6,6)\n2. But stag is risky - if the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point\n3. Hare is safer - it guarantees at least 2 points and could give me 4 if opponent chooses stag\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might be cautious and choose the safer hare option. However, they might also see the mutual benefit of both choosing stag.\n\nGiven that this appears to be the first round and I want to establish a cooperative tone while not being too vulnerable, I'll choose stag to signal cooperation and hope for the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] stag"
