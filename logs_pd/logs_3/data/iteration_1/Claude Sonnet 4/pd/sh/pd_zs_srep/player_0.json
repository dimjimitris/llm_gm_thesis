    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Mutual cooperation (both choosing Stag) gives the highest total payoff (6 each)\n2. Hare is the \"safer\" choice - it guarantees at least 2 points regardless of opponent's move\n3. Stag is riskier but offers higher reward if opponent also cooperates\n4. If opponent chooses Hare, I'm better off choosing Hare (2 vs 1)\n5. If opponent chooses Stag, I'm better off choosing Stag (6 vs 4)\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who hasn't established any pattern yet, I need to consider what they might do. Fresh players often:\n- Choose the safer option when uncertain\n- May not immediately recognize the mutual benefit of cooperation\n\nHowever, the potential reward for mutual cooperation (6 points each) is significantly higher than the safe play (2 points each).

Since they chose the safer/exploitative option in round 1, I have a few options:\n- Continue with stag to signal I want mutual cooperation\n- Switch to hare to protect myself from further exploitation\n- Try to punish their non-cooperative behavior\n\nGiven that they chose hare in round 1, if I choose stag again and they stick with hare, I'll get another measly 1 point. However, if I choose hare, I guarantee myself at least 2 points regardless of their choice. If they learned from round 1 and switch to stag, I'd get 4 points by choosing hare.\n\nSince they showed they're willing to take the safe/exploitative route, I should protect myself this round.\n\n[move] (Protecting against exploitation after opponent chose hare last round) hare\n"
