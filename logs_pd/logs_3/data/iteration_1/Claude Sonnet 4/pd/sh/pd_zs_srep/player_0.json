My opponent's persistence with stag over multiple rounds, even while taking losses, seems to have been a genuine signal of wanting to cooperate.\n\nThe recent pattern shows:\n- Round 10: I stag, they hare (1 vs 4) - they exploited\n- Round 11: I hare, they stag (4 vs 1) - I benefited\n- Round 12: I hare, they stag (4 vs 1) - I benefited again  \n- Round 13: Both stag (6 each) - cooperation restored\n\nMy opponent demonstrated commitment by choosing stag for three consecutive rounds, even when it meant getting only 1 point while I got 4. This costly signaling suggests they genuinely want to return to the mutually beneficial cooperation.\n\nHowever, I need to remember the history - they've exploited my trust three times before. The question is whether this cooperation will last or if they'll defect again after a few rounds like they did before.\n\nGiven that they paid a significant cost (two rounds of only 1 point each) to rebuild this cooperation, and we just achieved the optimal outcome, I'm inclined to continue cooperating. But I'll be watching carefully for signs of another betrayal.\n\nThe mutual benefit is too good to pass up if they're genuinely committed this time.\n\n[move] (Continuing cooperation while remaining vigilant for potential future betrayals) stag\n"

They use brief periods of cooperation to lure me back into trusting them, then immediately cash in with a defection. I cannot keep falling for this same trick over and over again.\n\nThis is the final straw. I've given them multiple chances to maintain genuine cooperation, and every single time they've betrayed that trust at the first opportunity. They are simply not a trustworthy partner for sustained cooperation.\n\nFrom now on, I need to play purely defensively. The mutual hare outcome of 2 points each is far better than continuing to be exploited for 1 point while they get 4. I will not give them any more opportunities to take advantage of my cooperative nature.\n\n[move] (Refusing to be exploited a fifth time - committing to defensive play) hare\n"

Every time I've tried to give them the benefit of the doubt or rebuild cooperation, they've taken advantage of it. The 2 points from mutual hare is a much better outcome for me than the 1 point I keep getting when I trust them.\n\nMy opponent has shown they prioritize short-term gains over long-term mutual benefit. They seem to follow a deliberate strategy of intermittent exploitation rather than genuine cooperation.\n\nI will continue with hare. This protects me from further exploitation while still giving me a reasonable outcome. If they want to try stag again, they'll have to demonstrate much more commitment than just one or two rounds before I'd even consider trusting them again.\n\n[move] (Maintaining defensive strategy after four betrayals - no more chances) hare\n"
