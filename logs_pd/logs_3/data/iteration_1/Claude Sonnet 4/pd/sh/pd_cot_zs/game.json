Fresh players often:\n   - Make more cautious/safe choices\n   - Might choose the option that guarantees some points regardless of opponent's choice\n   - May not immediately recognize the cooperation opportunity\n\n4. **Evaluate my options:**\n   - If I choose **stag**: Best case 6 points (if opponent cooperates), worst case 1 point (if opponent defects)\n   - If I choose **hare**: Best case 4 points (if opponent chooses stag), worst case 2 points (if opponent also chooses hare)\n\n5. **Strategic reasoning:**\n   Choosing hare is safer - it guarantees at least 2 points and could get me 4 points if the opponent tries to cooperate. Since this is a fresh player who may be cautious or unpredictable, the safer play seems more prudent for the first round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare to minimize risk while potentially capitalizing on an opponent who might attempt cooperation.\n\n[move] hare\n"

If they choose hare (revenge), I get 1 point.\n   - If I choose **hare**: Safe option again - guarantees 2-4 points depending on opponent's choice.\n\n5. **Strategic reasoning:**\n   Since the opponent showed cooperative intent initially, there's a chance they might try stag again, hoping I've learned the value of cooperation. The potential 6-point payoff is significant. However, they might also be hurt and switch to hare for safety.\n\nGiven that I already secured 4 points last round, I can afford to take a calculated risk for the much higher mutual benefit.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to attempt cooperation and potentially achieve the highest mutual payoff.\n\n[move] stag\n"

This isn't just optimal strategy anymore - it's the rational equilibrium that any intelligent player would maintain indefinitely.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to continue our highly successful cooperative partnership.\n\n[move] stag\n"
