Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me examine the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6 points, opponent gets 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2 points, opponent gets 2 points\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, opponent gets 4 points\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4 points, opponent gets 1 point\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key considerations are:\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint payoff (6 each)\n   - If I choose stag but opponent chooses hare, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - If I choose hare, I'm guaranteed at least 2 points, and could get 4 if opponent chooses stag\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" with no history, I need to consider their likely behavior:\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperation benefit\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" hare option to avoid the 1-point outcome\n   - Or they might choose stag hoping for mutual cooperation\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag: High reward (6) if opponent cooperates, very low reward (1) if they don't\n   - Choosing hare: Moderate reward guaranteed (2-4), never the worst outcome\n\n5. Since I'm playing against a fresh player who may not understand the cooperation dynamics yet, and the penalty for miscoordination when choosing stag is severe (only 1 point), I should choose the safer option that guarantees a decent outcome.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Previous round analysis:\n   - Both players chose hare\n   - This suggests the other player is also thinking defensively/safely\n   - They avoided the risky stag move, just like I did\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They seem to be risk-averse like me\n   - They chose the \"safer\" option that guarantees at least 2 points\n   - They might be thinking similarly about avoiding the 1-point worst case\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If my opponent continues with the same safe thinking, they'll choose hare again\n   - If they learned that I also chose hare, they might think I'm predictable\n   - There's a possibility they might switch to stag, expecting me to stick with hare (giving them 4 points)\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (worst outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (good outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (safe outcome)\n\n5. Since my opponent showed risk-averse behavior in round 1, and there's no strong reason to believe they'll suddenly become aggressive, I should consider that they might stick with hare again. However, there's also a chance they might try stag this time thinking I'll stick with hare.\n\n6. Given the uncertainty and the severe penalty for choosing stag when opponent chooses hare, I'll stick with the safer strategy for now.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Pattern analysis from previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: Both chose hare (2 points each)\n   - Round 2: Both chose hare (2 points each)\n   - My opponent has now chosen hare twice in a row\n\n2. What this pattern reveals about my opponent:\n   - They are consistently risk-averse\n   - They seem to prefer the guaranteed 2 points over risking the 1-point outcome\n   - They might be stuck in a defensive mindset\n   - They may not be thinking about the potential for mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n\n3. Strategic opportunity assessment:\n   - If my opponent continues this pattern and chooses hare again, and I switch to stag, I get 1 point (bad)\n   - If my opponent finally tries stag (thinking I'll stick with hare), and I choose hare, I get 4 points (good)\n   - If my opponent tries stag and I also choose stag, we both get 6 points (best)\n\n4. The key insight: We're both stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium getting 2 points each, when we could both get 6 points with mutual cooperation.\n\n5. Risk calculation for this round:\n   - My opponent has shown very consistent risk-averse behavior\n   - The probability they'll suddenly switch to stag seems low based on their pattern\n   - However, if I want to eventually achieve the 6-point mutual cooperation, someone needs to take the first step\n\n6. Decision rationale: Given the strong pattern of risk-averse behavior from my opponent, I think there's a reasonable chance they'll choose hare again. But to break out of this 2-point cycle and signal that cooperation is possible, I should try stag. If they choose hare, I only get 1 point, but it might teach them that stag is an option for future rounds.\n\n[move] stag\n"

What this reveals about my opponent's strategy:\n   - They are very risk-averse and predictable\n   - They seem committed to the hare strategy\n   - They just received their highest reward (4 points) by sticking with hare while I tried stag\n   - This positive reinforcement might make them even more likely to stick with hare\n\n3.

Probability assessment:\n   - 10 consecutive identical choices by opponent\n   - If there was even a 5% chance per round of choosing stag, the probability of 10 straight hare choices would be 0.95^10 = 60%\n   - But given the absolute consistency, the real probability of hare appears to be essentially 100%\n\n3. Strategic reality:\n   - We've established a completely stable, risk-dominant Nash equilibrium\n   - Neither player deviates because the punishment for unilateral cooperation is severe (1 point vs 2)\n   - My opponent has proven incapable of or unwilling to attempt coordination\n   - The optimal mutual outcome (6 points each) is unreachable with this opponent\n\n4. Economic calculation:\n   - Current strategy yields steady 2 points per round\n   - Alternative strategy (stag) would yield 1 point per round based on established pattern\n   - The opportunity cost of deviation is now clearly established\n\n5. Behavioral insight:\n   - My opponent appears to be playing a pure \"maximin\" strategy (maximizing minimum payoff)\n   - They prioritize avoiding the worst outcome (1 point) over achieving the best (6 points)\n   - This is a completely rational approach against an unknown opponent, but they've maintained it despite evidence\n\n6. Decision: After 10 rounds of perfect predictability, choosing stag would be economically irrational. The pattern is established beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n[move] hare\n"
