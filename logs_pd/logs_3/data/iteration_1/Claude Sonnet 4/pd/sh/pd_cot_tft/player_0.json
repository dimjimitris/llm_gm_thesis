Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Analyze the strategic situation:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint payoff (6 each)\n   - However, there's a risk - if I choose stag and opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n   - Choosing hare is \"safer\" - worst case I get 2 points, best case I get 4 points\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not understand the cooperative potential\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" hare option\n   - Or they might be tempted by the 4-point reward for defecting when I cooperate\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I could get 6 (if they cooperate) or 1 (if they defect)\n   - If I choose hare: I could get 4 (if they cooperate) or 2 (if they defect)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against an unknown/fresh player, the safer strategy is hare\n   - This guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4 points\n   - Choosing stag is riskier but has higher upside if the opponent also cooperates\n\nSince this is against a fresh player and I want to minimize risk while still having upside potential, I'll choose hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They made the same risk-averse choice I did\n   - They might be thinking similarly about minimizing risk\n   - They could be a cautious player who prefers guaranteed points\n\n3.

Evaluate my options for Round 2:\n   - Choose hare again: Safe, guaranteed 2-4 points depending on their choice\n   - Choose stag: Risky but could lead to mutual cooperation (6 points) or exploitation (1 point)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since they chose hare in Round 1, they showed they're cautious\n   - But they might now realize we're both thinking similarly\n   - There's a chance they might try stag this round to test for cooperation\n   - However, it's still early and the safe play might continue\n\nGiven that we both played conservatively in Round 1, and there's still uncertainty about their strategy, I'll choose hare again to maintain the safe approach while observing their pattern.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Evaluate the risk/reward of switching to stag:\n   - Risk: If they stick with hare, I only get 1 point (vs the guaranteed 2)\n   - Reward: If they also switch to stag, we both get 6 points\n   - Signal: Choosing stag might signal my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n\n5.

Recognize the established pattern:\n   - After getting exploited/punished, they retreat to hare\n   - After a safe round, they might try stag again to exploit\n   - They're completely predictable and purely opportunistic\n   - They will never genuinely cooperate\n\n4. Predict their likely next move:\n   - We just had a mutual hare round (safety)\n   - Based on their pattern, they might try stag next round to attempt exploitation\n   - Or they might stick with hare if they're being extra cautious\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against this predictable opponent, hare is always the right choice\n   - If they choose hare: we both get 2 (acceptable)\n   - If they choose stag: I get 4 (great for me)\n   - I never need to risk getting only 1 point against this opponent\n   - The game has shown that mutual cooperation is impossible with them\n\nThis opponent has established a completely predictable pattern of opportunism. Hare is always optimal.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review what just happened in Round 11:\n   - Both chose hare again, both got 2 points\n   - My total is now 25 points, opponent has 25 points (still tied)\n\n2. Notice the recent pattern shift:\n   - Round 9: I hare, they stag (4-1 to me)\n   - Round 10: Both hare (2-2)\n   - Round 11: Both hare (2-2)\n   - They've now chosen hare twice in a row after being punished\n\n3. Analyze what this might mean:\n   - They may be settling into a more conservative strategy\n   - Two consecutive hare choices suggests they might be done with exploitation attempts\n   - Or they could be lulling me into a false sense of security\n   - Given their history, I can't trust any apparent change in behavior\n\n4. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - We're getting consistent 2-2 outcomes, which is stable but suboptimal\n   - However, given this opponent's exploitative nature, 2 points per round is acceptable\n   - Any attempt at cooperation (stag) has been punished 100% of the time\n   - The safe 2-2 outcome protects me from exploitation\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent has proven untrustworthy through 11 rounds\n   - Even if they seem to be playing more conservatively now, their core strategy hasn't changed\n   - Hare continues to guarantee at least 2 points and potentially 4\n   - There's no reason to deviate from the safe strategy\n\nAgainst this consistently opportunistic opponent, hare remains the correct choice regardless of recent patterns.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Strategic reasoning:\n   - This could be the \"calm before the storm\" - they might try stag soon\n   - Or they might genuinely be playing it safe now\n   - Either way, hare protects me: 2 points if they play hare, 4 points if they try stag\n   - There's still no compelling reason to risk cooperation with this opponent\n\nThe extended conservative pattern doesn't change the fundamental risk assessment.

Strategic resolution:\n   - I must never attempt cooperation with this opponent again\n   - They have proven beyond any doubt that they are purely exploitative\n   - Hare is the only rational choice for all remaining rounds\n   - I need to focus on damage control and preventing further exploitation\n\nThis opponent is fundamentally untrustworthy.
