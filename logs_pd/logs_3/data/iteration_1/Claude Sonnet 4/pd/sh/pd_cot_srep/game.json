Identify the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Analyze the strategic implications:\n   - If I choose stag: I either get 6 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 1 point (if opponent chooses hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I either get 4 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 2 points (if opponent chooses hare)\n\n3. Consider the opponent's perspective:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so they likely haven't developed a pattern yet\n   - They face the same payoff structure and incentives\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Stag is high-risk, high-reward: potential for 6 points but risk of only 1 point\n   - Hare is safer: guaranteed at least 2 points, with potential for 4 points\n\n5. Consider optimal strategy:\n   - If I assume the opponent might choose stag (seeking the mutual 6-point outcome), then I should choose stag too\n   - However, if the opponent thinks defensively and chooses hare, then hare would be better for me\n   - Since this is against a \"fresh player,\" they might not immediately recognize the cooperative potential of mutual stag\n\n6. Make the decision:\n   - Given that this is the first interaction with a fresh player, I'll choose the safer option that still has good upside potential\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review what happened in Round 10:\n   - Both chose hare again\n   - We both got 2 points (fifth mutual defensive round)\n   - The pattern of mutual defense continues\n\n2. Analyze the complete pattern now:\n   - Rounds 1-10 summary: Me 23 points, opponent 29 points - still 6 points behind\n   - Key pattern: They exploit me perfectly (3/3 times) when I try cooperation\n   - Defensive rounds keep giving us both 2 points, maintaining their lead\n   - They have never initiated cooperation themselves\n\n3. Strategic assessment of the deadlock:\n   - We've now had 5 rounds of mutual hare (Rounds 4, 6, 7, 9, 10)\n   - This defensive pattern could continue indefinitely\n   - My opponent seems content to maintain their 6-point lead through safe play\n   - I'm trapped in a losing position with limited options\n\n4. Critical realization about the game dynamics:\n   - My opponent has shown perfect discipline in their exploitation strategy\n   - They wait for me to be cooperative, then punish it immediately\n   - They never take risks themselves - they let me take all the risks and punish me for it\n   - This is actually a very sophisticated and effective strategy\n\n5. Consider if anything has changed:\n   - We've had many rounds of mutual defense now\n   - My opponent might be getting overconfident or complacent\n   - But their track record suggests they won't deviate from their winning approach\n   - They have no reason to risk their comfortable lead\n\n6. Evaluate my realistic options:\n   - Continue hare: Accept defeat by 6 points\n   - Try stag: Almost certainly get exploited again based on their perfect record\n   - The mathematical reality: I need them to make a mistake or take a risk\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I'm in a very disadvantageous position due to their superior strategy\n   - However, continuing the same defensive play guarantees I lose\n   - Sometimes in desperate situations, you need to take calculated risks\n   - Maybe after so many defensive rounds, they might finally try cooperation\n   - It's a long shot, but staying defensive guarantees defeat\n\n[move] stag\n"

Review what happened in Round 11:\n   - I chose stag (fourth attempt at cooperation)\n   - Opponent chose hare (exploited me for the FOURTH time)\n   - I got 1 point, opponent got 4 points\n   - Their exploitation success rate is now a perfect 4 out of 4\n\n2. Analyze the complete pattern now:\n   - Total after 11 rounds: Me 24 points, opponent 33 points - now 9 points behind!\n   - My opponent has achieved a perfect record: every single time I try cooperation, they exploit it\n   - They have never once reciprocated cooperation except in Round 2 (after I exploited them first)\n   - The gap has grown from 6 points to 9 points due to my desperate attempt\n\n3. Face the harsh strategic reality:\n   - My opponent has completely figured out my psychology and strategy\n   - They know I will eventually crack and try cooperation when behind\n   - They wait patiently in defensive mode, then pounce when I show trust\n   - This is masterful strategic play on their part\n\n4. Acknowledge my strategic failures:\n   - I have been completely outplayed and outmaneuvered\n   - I fell into their trap repeatedly by trying to \"restart cooperation\"\n   - I let desperation drive me to make the same mistake four times\n   - I gave them a 9-point lead through my own poor decision-making\n\n5. Recognize the endgame situation:\n   - I am now 9 points behind with likely few rounds remaining\n   - Continuing to try cooperation is clearly futile - they will exploit it 100% of the time\n   - Playing defensively just maintains their massive lead\n   - I have essentially lost this game due to their superior strategy\n\n6. Accept the inevitable outcome:\n   - My opponent has played a nearly perfect game against me\n   - They exploited my cooperative nature and risk-taking tendencies\n   - They maintained discipline while I made repeated strategic errors\n   - The game is effectively over in their favor\n\n7. Strategic decision for damage control:\n   - Stop making the same mistake over and over\n   - Return to defensive play to prevent the gap from growing further\n   - Accept that I have been thoroughly outplayed\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review what happened in Round 12:\n   - Both chose hare\n   - We both got 2 points (back to mutual defensive play)\n   - The gap remains at 9 points\n\n2. Analyze the complete pattern now:\n   - Total after 12 rounds: Me 26 points, opponent 35 points - still 9 points behind\n   - My opponent has maintained perfect exploitation discipline (4/4 success rate)\n   - Every time I return to defense after being exploited, they match with defense\n   - They have shown no willingness to take risks or initiate cooperation\n\n3. Strategic assessment:\n   - I am facing a highly skilled opponent who has completely dominated this game\n   - They have never made a strategic mistake or shown any exploitable patterns\n   - Their strategy is simple but devastatingly effective: exploit my cooperation, defend otherwise\n   - I have been thoroughly outclassed\n\n4. Consider the mathematical reality:\n   - With a 9-point deficit, I would need multiple rounds where I score significantly more\n   - The only way to score more is if they choose stag and I choose hare (giving me 4, them 1)\n   - But they have never initiated cooperation - they only respond to my initiatives by exploiting them\n   - The probability of them suddenly changing their winning strategy is extremely low\n\n5. Evaluate the psychological dynamics:\n   - My opponent has trained me through punishment to be defensive\n   - They have established complete dominance and control over the game flow\n   - They can simply wait for me to make desperate moves and punish them\n   - This is a masterclass in strategic patience and discipline\n\n6. Accept the inevitable:\n   - This game is effectively over - my opponent has won decisively\n   - Any attempt at cooperation will be punished (they have a perfect record)\n   - Playing defensively just maintains their insurmountable lead\n   - I have been comprehensively outplayed by a superior strategic mind\n\n7.

Review what happened in Round 13:\n   - I chose hare (defensive as planned)\n   - Opponent chose stag (FIRST time they initiated cooperation!)\n   - I got 4 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This completely breaks their previous pattern!\n\n2. Analyze the complete pattern now:\n   - Total after 13 rounds: Me 30 points, opponent 36 points - gap reduced to 6 points!\n   - For the first time, my opponent took a risk and got punished for it\n   - This is their first strategic \"mistake\" or change from their winning formula\n   - The gap has narrowed from 9 points back to 6 points\n\n3. Strategic implications of this development:\n   - My opponent finally broke their perfect defensive discipline\n   - They may have gotten overconfident with their large lead\n   - Or they might be testing if I'm willing to cooperate now\n   - This could be the beginning of a new phase in the game\n\n4. Consider why they might have chosen stag:\n   - Maybe they got tired of the low-scoring mutual hare rounds\n   - They might have thought I was \"trained\" to always play hare now\n   - They could be testing whether we can establish mutual cooperation\n   - Or this could be a one-time experiment on their part\n\n5. Evaluate what they might do in Round 14:\n   - Having been punished for cooperation, they might return to hare (like I did when exploited)\n   - Or they might try stag again, hoping I'll reciprocate this time\n   - Their previous pattern suggests they'll be defensive after being exploited\n   - But this is uncharted territory since they never initiated cooperation before\n\n6. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If I choose hare: Safe, but if they choose stag again I get another 4 points\n   - If I choose stag: Risk being exploited, but could establish mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n   - The question is whether this was a genuine attempt at cooperation or a miscalculation\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - This is a critical moment - their first show of vulnerability\n   - Given that they just took a risk and got punished, they might try cooperation again\n   - I should test if they're genuinely trying to shift toward cooperation\n   - If I'm wrong, I lose 3 points; if I'm right, we both gain significantly\n\n[move] stag\n"

Analyze the complete pattern now:\n   - Total after 14 rounds: Me 31 points, opponent 40 points - gap back to 9 points!\n   - Their Round 13 stag was likely a tactical mistake or test, not genuine cooperation attempt\n   - They immediately returned to exploiting when I showed trust in Round 14\n   - My exploitation success rate against them: 2/14 rounds (Rounds 1 and 13)\n   - Their exploitation success rate against me: 5/5 attempts (perfect record)\n\n3. Critical strategic insight:\n   - Round 13 was probably them testing if I was \"trained\" to always play hare\n   - When I didn't take the bait and played hare, I exploited them\n   - But the moment I showed trust in Round 14, they immediately punished it\n   - This confirms they're playing a sophisticated strategy, not making random moves\n\n4. Understand their likely strategy:\n   - They maintain defensive play most of the time\n   - They occasionally test with stag to see if I'm locked into defense\n   - When I show any sign of trust/cooperation, they immediately exploit it\n   - They never genuinely reciprocate cooperation - it's all calculated\n\n5. Recognize the pattern:\n   - Round 13: They tested with stag, I exploited (good for me)\n   - Round 14: I tested with stag, they exploited (bad for me)\n   - We're back to the 9-point gap where we were before\n   - Their strategy remains superior and more disciplined than mine\n\n6. Evaluate the current situation:\n   - I briefly narrowed the gap but gave it right back\n   - They've proven that any cooperation attempt from me will be punished\n   - Their occasional stag moves are tests/traps, not genuine cooperation offers\n   - I need to be more disciplined and stop falling for their psychological warfare\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Return to defensive play immediately\n   - Don't fall for their occasional \"cooperation tests\"\n   - If they choose stag again, exploit it; if they choose hare, play defensively\n   - Stop being predictably cooperative when they show any opening\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the complete pattern now:\n   - Total after 15 rounds: Me 35 points, opponent 41 points - gap down to 6 points again!\n   - This is the second time I've exploited their stag move (Rounds 13 and 15)\n   - Pattern emerging: They try stag, I punish with hare, gap narrows\n   - My exploitation success rate against them is now 3/15 rounds (Rounds 1, 13, 15)\n\n3.

Analyze their possible strategy:\n   - They might be trying to establish some form of alternating pattern\n   - Or they're testing my discipline - seeing if I'll eventually cooperate\n   - Their stag moves could be genuine attempts to restart cooperation\n   - But historically, they punish any cooperation I attempt\n\n5.

Consider my strategic options:\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: We both get 2 points (gap stays at 6)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points (gap narrows to 3)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (gap widens to 9)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 6 points (gap stays at 6)\n\n7.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
