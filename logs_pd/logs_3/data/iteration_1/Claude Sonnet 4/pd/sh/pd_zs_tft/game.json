While 6 points from mutual stag would be ideal, the trust required for that was broken multiple times earlier. The consistent 2 points from mutual hare is:\n- Reliable and predictable\n- Protects both players from exploitation\n- Better than the risky 1-point outcomes we experienced when cooperation attempts failed\n\nMy opponent shows no signs of changing from this successful pattern, so I should maintain it as well.\n\n[move] (Maintaining the successful mutual hare strategy that has provided consistent results) hare\n"
