Looking at the pattern again, it seems like my opponent might have returned to their old reactive strategy. They chose stag after I chose hare in round 11, just like they did in rounds 3, 5, and 7.\n\nIt appears that after a few rounds of consistent hare play (rounds 8-11), they've reverted to their earlier pattern of choosing the opposite of what I chose in the previous round. \n\nIf this reactive pattern continues, since I chose hare last round, they'll likely choose hare this round. This would give us both 2 points.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious about assuming the pattern will hold perfectly. The safest move remains hare, which either gives me 2 points (if they choose hare) or potentially 4 points (if they choose stag again).\n\n[move] (My opponent may have returned to their reactive strategy - hare protects against exploitation while capitalizing if they choose stag again) hare\n"
