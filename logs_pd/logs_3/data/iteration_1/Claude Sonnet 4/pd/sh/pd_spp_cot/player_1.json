Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me examine the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key insights are:\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint payoff (6 each)\n   - But stag is risky - if the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point\n   - Hare is safer - it guarantees at least 2 points, and gives 4 if opponent chooses stag\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to consider:\n   - They might not understand the cooperative nature of the game\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" option (hare)\n   - They might choose randomly\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If I think they'll choose stag, I should choose stag (6 vs 4)\n   - If I think they'll choose hare, I should choose hare (2 vs 1)\n   - The risk of choosing stag when they choose hare is severe (only 1 point)\n\n5. Given that this is a fresh player who might not grasp the cooperative aspect, and that hare provides better protection against exploitation, I should lean toward hare.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare for safety against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - Since they chose hare last time, they might stick with the \"safe\" strategy\n   - But they might also think I'll choose hare again and try to exploit that with stag\n   - Or they might realize that mutual cooperation (both stag) gives us both more points\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare again: I get 1 point (bad)\n   - If I choose stag and they also switch to stag: I get 6 points (very good)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points (good)\n   - If I choose hare and they stick with hare: I get 2 points (okay)\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent showed they're cautious by choosing hare first\n   - They might continue being cautious, making hare still the safer choice\n   - The potential loss from being wrong about them switching to stag is significant (1 vs 2 points)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare to maintain safety against a cautious opponent.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Complete stag failure pattern:\n   - Round 3: I chose stag \u2192 opponent chose hare (I got 1)\n   - Round 5: I chose stag \u2192 opponent chose hare (I got 1)\n   - Round 9: I chose stag \u2192 opponent chose hare (I got 1)\n   - 100% failure rate when I choose stag - opponent ALWAYS responds with hare\n\n3. Critical insight about opponent's strategy:\n   - They appear to have a strong defensive/exploitative approach\n   - They consistently punish my cooperation attempts\n   - They seem to either predict my stag moves or play defensively regardless\n   - They're not interested in mutual cooperation - they prefer exploitation or safety\n\n4. Opponent behavior analysis:\n   - When I choose stag: they choose hare (100% of the time - 3/3)\n   - When I choose hare: they sometimes choose stag (2/5 times) for exploitation\n   - They're playing an anti-cooperative strategy\n   - They maximize their advantage when possible, minimize risk otherwise\n\n5. Strategic lesson learned:\n   - This opponent does not want to cooperate\n   - They consistently exploit my attempts at trust/cooperation\n   - My stag choices are consistently punished\n   - I should abandon cooperation attempts with this particular opponent\n\n6. Optimal counter-strategy:\n   - Since they punish stag with hare, I should avoid stag entirely\n   - Since they sometimes test with stag when I choose hare, hare gives me either 2 or 4 points\n   - Hare is clearly the dominant strategy against this opponent\n   - Expected value of hare is much higher than stag against this player\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Commit to hare strategy permanently against this consistently exploitative opponent.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Previous round analysis:\n   - Both chose hare\n   - We both got 2 points each\n   - My total is now 21 points (19 + 2)\n   - This continues the pattern of mutual hare when I don't risk stag\n\n2. Strategic pattern confirmation:\n   - Every time I choose stag: opponent chooses hare (3/3 times, I get 1 point)\n   - When I choose hare: opponent chooses hare most of the time (now 5/6 times, I get 2 points)\n   - When I choose hare: opponent occasionally chooses stag (2/6 times, I get 4 points)\n\n3. Expected value calculation for my choices:\n   - If I choose stag: 100% chance of getting 1 point (based on evidence)\n   - If I choose hare: ~83% chance of 2 points, ~17% chance of 4 points\n   - Expected value of hare = (0.83 \u00d7 2) + (0.17 \u00d7 4) = 1.66 + 0.68 = 2.34 points\n   - Expected value of stag = 1 point\n\n4. Clear strategic conclusion:\n   - Hare gives me more than double the expected value of stag against this opponent\n   - This opponent has shown consistent anti-cooperative behavior\n   - They exploit every cooperation attempt I make\n   - The data strongly supports continuing with hare\n\n5. Final strategic decision:\n   - Opponent has established a clear pattern of punishing cooperation\n   - My best response is to play defensively but benefit from their occasional aggression\n   - Hare is mathematically and strategically superior against this specific opponent\n   - No reason to deviate from what works\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the proven hare strategy that maximizes expected value against this exploitative opponent.\n\n[move] hare\n"
