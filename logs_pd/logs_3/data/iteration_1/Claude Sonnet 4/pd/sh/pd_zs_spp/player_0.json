    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The key insight is that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest joint payoff, but it's risky because if the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might be inclined to play it safe with hare, or they might go for the cooperative stag option. \n\nGiven that stag-stag is the best mutual outcome (6 points each) and establishes a good precedent for potential future rounds, I'll take the cooperative approach and signal my willingness to work together for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] I choose stag to aim for the mutually beneficial outcome where we both get 6 points.\n"
