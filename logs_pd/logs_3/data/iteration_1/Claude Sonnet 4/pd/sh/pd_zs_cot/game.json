Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest mutual payoff\n   - However, there's risk involved - if I choose stag and opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n   - If I choose hare, I guarantee at least 2 points and could get 4 if opponent chooses stag\n\n3. Consider that this is against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperative benefit of choosing stag\n   - They might choose hare as a safer option or due to lack of strategic thinking\n   - There's uncertainty about their choice\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing stag: High reward (6) if opponent cooperates, very low reward (1) if they don't\n   - Choosing hare: Moderate guaranteed minimum (2), good reward (4) if opponent chooses stag\n\n5. Given the uncertainty with a fresh player and the significant penalty for miscoordination when choosing stag, the safer strategic choice is hare, which guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I got 4 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This confirms the opponent was willing to risk the cooperative move\n\n2. Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose stag in the first round, showing they're willing to go for the high-reward cooperative option\n   - They likely understand the game mechanics since stag is the \"sophisticated\" choice\n   - They may have been testing for cooperation or genuinely trying to establish mutual cooperation\n\n3. Consider their likely response to this round:\n   - They got burned (only 1 point) by trusting me while I got 4 points\n   - They might switch to hare this round to avoid being exploited again\n   - Or they might stick with stag if they're trying to signal continued willingness to cooperate\n   - They could also be thinking I'll assume they'll switch to hare, so they might stick with stag\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 6 (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1, they get 4 (they get revenge)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4, they get 1 (repeat exploitation)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: We both get 2 (safe but suboptimal)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent showed cooperative intent initially\n   - Continuing to exploit with hare might work short-term but could lead to mutual defection\n   - Choosing stag shows I'm willing to cooperate and could establish the optimal 6-6 outcome\n   - Given they tried cooperation first, reciprocating might build trust\n\n[move] stag\n"

Analyze what this pattern reveals:\n   - Opponent started with cooperative move (stag) despite being a \"fresh player\"\n   - After being exploited in round 1, they stuck with stag in round 2\n   - This shows remarkable commitment to cooperation despite the initial setback\n   - We achieved the optimal mutual outcome (6-6) in round 2\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They demonstrated they want to establish mutual cooperation\n   - They forgave my initial exploitation and rewarded my cooperative move with cooperation\n   - They're likely hoping to continue the 6-6 pattern since it worked\n   - Their persistence with cooperation suggests they understand the long-term benefits\n\n4. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If I choose stag: High chance of 6-6 again based on established pattern\n   - If I choose hare: I could get 4 points, but this would break the trust we've built\n   - Breaking cooperation now would likely lead to mutual defection (2-2) in future rounds\n\n5.
