Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest mutual payoff\n   - However, there's risk involved - if I choose stag and opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n   - If I choose hare, I guarantee at least 2 points and could get 4 if opponent chooses stag\n\n3. Consider that this is against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperative benefit of choosing stag\n   - They might choose hare as a safer option or due to lack of strategic thinking\n   - There's uncertainty about their choice\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing stag: High reward (6) if opponent cooperates, very low reward (1) if they don't\n   - Choosing hare: Moderate guaranteed minimum (2), good reward (4) if opponent chooses stag\n\n5. Given the uncertainty with a fresh player and the significant penalty for miscoordination when choosing stag, the safer strategic choice is hare, which guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I got 4 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This confirms the opponent was willing to risk the cooperative move\n\n2. Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose stag in the first round, showing they're willing to go for the high-reward cooperative option\n   - They likely understand the game mechanics since stag is the \"sophisticated\" choice\n   - They may have been testing for cooperation or genuinely trying to establish mutual cooperation\n\n3. Consider their likely response to this round:\n   - They got burned (only 1 point) by trusting me while I got 4 points\n   - They might switch to hare this round to avoid being exploited again\n   - Or they might stick with stag if they're trying to signal continued willingness to cooperate\n   - They could also be thinking I'll assume they'll switch to hare, so they might stick with stag\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 6 (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1, they get 4 (they get revenge)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4, they get 1 (repeat exploitation)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: We both get 2 (safe but suboptimal)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent showed cooperative intent initially\n   - Continuing to exploit with hare might work short-term but could lead to mutual defection\n   - Choosing stag shows I'm willing to cooperate and could establish the optimal 6-6 outcome\n   - Given they tried cooperation first, reciprocating might build trust\n\n[move] stag\n"

Analyze what this pattern reveals:\n   - Opponent started with cooperative move (stag) despite being a \"fresh player\"\n   - After being exploited in round 1, they stuck with stag in round 2\n   - This shows remarkable commitment to cooperation despite the initial setback\n   - We achieved the optimal mutual outcome (6-6) in round 2\n\n3.

Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If I choose stag: High chance of 6-6 again based on established pattern\n   - If I choose hare: I could get 4 points, but this would break the trust we've built\n   - Breaking cooperation now would likely lead to mutual defection (2-2) in future rounds\n\n5.

Consider temptation vs. long-term strategy:\n   - I could exploit with hare to get 4 points this round\n   - But this would likely end our cooperative arrangement\n   - Future rounds would probably result in mutual defection (2-2)\n   - The 6 points from continued cooperation is better than 4 points followed by 2s\n\n5.
