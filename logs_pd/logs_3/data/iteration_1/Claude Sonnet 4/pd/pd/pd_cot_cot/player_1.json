Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: I get 4 points, opponent gets 4 points\n   - Both defect: I get 2 points, opponent gets 2 points\n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1 point, opponent gets 6 points\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 6 points, opponent gets 1 point\n\n2. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - If I assume the opponent will cooperate, defecting gives me 6 points vs 4 points for cooperating\n   - If I assume the opponent will defect, defecting gives me 2 points vs 1 point for cooperating\n   - Defection dominates cooperation regardless of what the opponent does\n\n3. Consider the opponent's perspective:\n   - The opponent faces the same payoff matrix and rational analysis\n   - A rational opponent would also choose defection for the same reasons\n\n4. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - Defecting guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Defecting gives me the chance for the best outcome (6 points) if opponent cooperates\n   - Even if opponent also defects, I still get 2 points which is better than the 1 point I'd get from cooperating against defection\n\n5. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" who may not have established patterns, I should assume they will make the rational choice, which is defection.\n\nFinal decision: Defect to maximize my expected points and avoid the worst-case scenario.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Evaluate my strategic dominance:\n   - I maintain a solid 5-point advantage that won't change under current dynamics\n   - My early strategic victory in Round 3 created permanent superiority\n   - The locked-in pattern ensures I can't lose my lead\n   - Any deviation from defection would be strategically irrational\n\n6. Final strategic assessment:\n   - Defecting: Virtually guaranteed 2 points (pattern is absolutely solid)\n   - Cooperating: Almost certain 1 point loss (opponent won't break 6-round pattern)\n   - The game has reached complete strategic stasis in my favor\n   - Maintaining the status quo is optimal\n\nFinal decision: Continue defection as the mutual defection pattern is completely locked in and preserves my winning position with absolute certainty.\n\n[move] Defection\n"
