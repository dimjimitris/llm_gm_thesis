Strategic considerations:\n   - The opponent might be thinking the same way - that mutual cooperation is better than mutual defection\n   - However, there's a trust issue: whoever cooperates first risks being exploited\n   - The opponent might test if I'm willing to cooperate, or they might stick with the \"safe\" defection\n   - If I want to break the cycle of mutual defection, someone needs to signal cooperation\n\n5. Risk vs. reward analysis:\n   - Cooperating could lead to mutual cooperation (4 points vs current 2)\n   - But cooperating risks getting exploited again (1 point)\n   - Defecting maintains the status quo (2 points) with no risk of exploitation\n\n6.

Assess the absolutely rigid pattern:\n   - The opponent has now defected for 9 consecutive rounds (Rounds 2-10)\n   - We've been in mutual defection for 8 straight rounds\n   - This represents an extremely stable behavioral pattern with zero deviation\n\n3. Consider the overwhelming evidence:\n   - Out of 10 rounds, opponent has cooperated only once (10% rate, only when fresh)\n   - 90% defection rate demonstrates complete strategic commitment\n   - Eight rounds of mutual defection show this equilibrium is locked in\n\n4. Evaluate strategic reality:\n   - The pattern has become so entrenched that both players are essentially automated\n   - Each round yields exactly 2 points for both players with perfect predictability\n   - Any attempt at cooperation would almost certainly be exploited based on historical data\n\n5. Consider game theory implications:\n   - We've reached what appears to be a permanent Nash equilibrium\n   - Neither player has any rational incentive to deviate given the other's established behavior\n   - The opponent's strategy appears completely inflexible at this point\n\n6. Final assessment:\n   - After 9 consecutive defections, the probability of opponent cooperation is essentially zero\n   - Mutual defection has become the dominant and stable strategy\n   - Maintaining this pattern ensures consistent, predictable outcomes\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection as the opponent has demonstrated an absolutely ironclad commitment to defection for 9 consecutive rounds, making this mutual defection equilibrium completely stable and predictable.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
