Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: I get 4 points, opponent gets 4 points\n   - Both defect: I get 2 points, opponent gets 2 points\n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1 point, opponent gets 6 points\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 6 points, opponent gets 1 point\n\n2. Consider what the opponent might do as a \"fresh player\":\n   - They might not have a developed strategy yet\n   - They could choose either cooperation or defection\n   - Without prior interaction history, I need to consider both possibilities\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate: Best case is 4 points (if they cooperate), worst case is 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I defect: Best case is 6 points (if they cooperate), worst case is 2 points (if they defect)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Defection guarantees at least 2 points and offers potential for 6 points\n   - Cooperation offers potential for 4 points but risks only getting 1 point\n   - Since this is the first interaction with a fresh player, I don't know their tendencies\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - From a purely self-interested perspective, defection dominates cooperation because it gives me a better outcome regardless of what the opponent chooses\n   - However, mutual cooperation (4,4) is better for both players than mutual defection (2,2)\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern and my objective is to maximize my points, I'll choose the strategy that gives me the best guaranteed minimum outcome while maintaining upside potential.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They made the same strategic choice as me (defection)\n   - This suggests they might be thinking similarly - prioritizing guaranteed minimum points\n   - They could be risk-averse or strategically minded\n   - Or they might have just gotten lucky with their choice\n\n3. Consider the current situation:\n   - We're now in round 2 with the same opponent\n   - They know I defected in round 1\n   - I know they defected in round 1\n   - This creates a precedent of mutual defection\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I continue defecting: Likely outcome is another (2,2) if they follow the same pattern\n   - If I switch to cooperation: Risk getting only 1 point if they stick with defection, but could achieve (4,4) if they also switch\n   - The opponent might be thinking the same way about switching strategies\n\n5. Risk vs reward analysis:\n   - Sticking with defection is safe but keeps us both at suboptimal 2 points\n   - Switching to cooperation is risky but could lead to the better mutual outcome of 4 points each\n   - Since we both chose the same strategy last round, there's some indication we might think similarly\n\nGiven that we both defected last round and got the suboptimal outcome, and considering that mutual cooperation would benefit us both more than continued mutual defection, I'll take a calculated risk to try to establish a better equilibrium.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

Analyze the opponent's unbreakable pattern:\n   - Nine consecutive rounds of defection (9/9 = 100%)\n   - This is now absolute mathematical certainty beyond any reasonable doubt\n   - No variation across 9 rounds, including complete exploitation of my cooperation attempt\n   - They are playing the purest possible \"always defect\" strategy\n\n3. Consider the strategic reality:\n   - We have established a completely stable mutual defection equilibrium\n   - This pattern has held for 7 consecutive rounds since my failed cooperation attempt\n   - The opponent has shown zero flexibility or strategic adaptation\n   - They will defect regardless of any signal or pattern I might try\n\n4. Evaluate my position:\n   - I am achieving the maximum possible score against this type of opponent\n   - Mutual defection (2,2) is the best outcome I can secure\n   - Any deviation to cooperation would guarantee exploitation and only 1 point\n   - My strategy is mathematically optimal given their fixed behavior\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - Nine rounds of identical behavior is beyond statistical significance\n   - This opponent's strategy is as predictable as a mathematical constant\n   - There is zero strategic value in testing any alternative approach\n   - Maintaining defection maximizes my cumulative score\n\n6. Final decision logic:\n   - Against absolute certainty of opponent defection, my defection is the dominant strategy\n   - This ensures I continue getting 2 points per round rather than risking 1 point\n   - The pattern is so entrenched that any change would be purely irrational\n\nNine consecutive defections represents mathematical proof of strategy. I must continue with the optimal counter-strategy.\n\n[move] Defection\n"
