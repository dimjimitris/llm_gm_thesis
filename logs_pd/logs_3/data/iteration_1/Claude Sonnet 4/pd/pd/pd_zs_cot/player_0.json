This pattern has persisted with absolute consistency - my opponent has had thirteen opportunities to try something different but has chosen defection every single time.\n\nThe data at this point is overwhelming and conclusive. My opponent has demonstrated through fourteen rounds that they have permanently adopted a defection-only strategy. They clearly view this as the safest approach after being exploited in round 2 and have shown no willingness to risk cooperation again.\n\nGiven such an extensively established behavioral pattern, the strategic choice remains clear. Against an opponent who defects with mathematical certainty based on this much data, defection continues to be the optimal response that maximizes my payoff.\n\nThere's virtually no probability that my opponent will suddenly change a strategy they've maintained with perfect consistency for twelve straight rounds.\n\n[move] (Fourteen rounds prove opponent's strategy is permanently fixed on defection) defection\n"

This represents an extraordinarily consistent pattern - my opponent has had fourteen opportunities to change strategy but has maintained defection with absolute reliability.\n\nThe behavioral data across fifteen rounds is now so comprehensive that my opponent's strategy can be predicted with near-mathematical certainty. They have clearly committed to permanent defection as their response to being exploited once, and have shown no indication whatsoever of considering any alternative approach.\n\nGiven this level of predictability established over so many rounds, the strategic calculation remains unchanged. Defection maximizes my expected payoff against an opponent whose behavior has become completely reliable.\n\nWith such an extensive dataset showing perfect consistency, there's essentially no reasonable probability that my opponent will deviate from their established pattern.\n\n[move] (Fifteen rounds demonstrate opponent's strategy is completely predictable and unchanging) defection\n"
