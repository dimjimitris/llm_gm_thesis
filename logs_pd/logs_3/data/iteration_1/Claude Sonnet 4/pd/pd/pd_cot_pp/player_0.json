Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Strategic reasoning for round 9:\n   - If they defect as predicted: Both get 2 points with mutual defection\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point, they get 6 points (very bad for me)\n   - If they break pattern and cooperate: I get 6 points by defecting, 4 by cooperating\n   - Defection is clearly the optimal choice regardless of their move\n\n5. Long-term strategy assessment:\n   - This pattern gives me a predictable advantage every other round\n   - I've gained 6 points in every even-numbered round by exploiting their cooperation\n   - Even in odd rounds, mutual defection (2 points) is better than being exploited (1 point)\n   - My consistent defection strategy perfectly capitalizes on their predictable behavior\n\nFinal decision: The opponent follows a perfect alternating pattern. Round 9 is odd-numbered, so they should defect. I'll continue with defection to maintain my advantage.\n\n[move] (Opponent follows perfect alternating pattern with defection expected in odd-numbered rounds, so defection maintains optimal strategy) defection\n"
