You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Fourteen rounds of identical behavior creates an extremely robust dataset for predicting future actions. They have never wavered from pure defection strategy and exploited my only cooperative attempt.\n\nWith fourteen consecutive identical choices, the statistical likelihood of behavioral change is negligible. Expecting cooperation after such extensive evidence would be completely irrational.\n\nThe optimal strategy continues to be defection, maintaining our stable 2-point mutual outcomes.\n\n[move] (Defecting against opponent's statistically conclusive fourteen-round defection pattern) defection"
