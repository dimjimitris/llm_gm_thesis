Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since the opponent is fresh/new, they might be more likely to cooperate initially, as cooperation seems like the \"nice\" or default choice.\n\n5. Defection gives me the chance for the maximum payoff (6 points) if they cooperate, and even if they defect, I still get 2 points rather than the worst outcome of 1 point.\n\n6. The risk-reward analysis favors defection: best case is 6 points, worst case is 2 points, versus cooperation's best case of 4 points and worst case of 1 point.\n\nFinal decision: Since this is against a fresh player who may be inclined to cooperate, and defection offers both higher maximum reward and better minimum outcome, I will defect.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Evaluate my best response:\n   - If they're likely to defect again, defection gives me 2 points vs 1 point for cooperation\n   - If they switch to cooperation, defection gives me 6 points vs 4 points for cooperation\n   - Defection dominates cooperation in both scenarios\n\n6.

Evaluate potential strategy changes:\n   - Three rounds of identical behavior suggests the opponent is committed to defection\n   - They may be using the same logic I am: defection is \"safe\"\n   - Breaking the pattern first requires accepting significant risk\n\n5. Consider if I should try to signal cooperation:\n   - Cooperating once could signal willingness to move to mutual cooperation\n   - But if opponent continues defecting, I lose significantly (1 vs 2 points)\n   - There's no guarantee they would reciprocate even if they notice the signal\n\n6.

Evaluate the opportunity for change:\n   - The pattern is so established that a cooperation move would be clearly intentional\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (loss of 1 from current strategy)\n   - If I cooperate and they also cooperate: I get 4 points (gain of 2 from current strategy)\n   - The potential upside (2 extra points) outweighs the potential downside (1 lost point)\n\n5. Consider signaling strategy:\n   - After 4 rounds of identical play, a cooperation move would be a clear signal\n   - If the opponent is rational, they might recognize this as an attempt to reach the better outcome\n   - Even if they don't cooperate this round, it might influence future rounds\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The deadlock is hurting both of us\n   - Someone needs to take the risk to potentially unlock better outcomes\n   - The math favors attempting cooperation: risk 1 point to potentially gain 2\n\nFinal decision: After 4 rounds of mutual defection, it's time to attempt breaking the deadlock.

Evaluate my current strategic position:\n   - The alternating pattern that was giving us both decent points (3.5 average) is broken\n   - We're back to the safe but suboptimal mutual defection (2 points each)\n   - I can't predict their next move based on previous patterns\n   - I need to decide without assuming any predictable opponent behavior\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown they will break patterns when it suits them\n   - They seem to default to defection when uncertain or when patterns are broken\n   - Given their unpredictability, I should choose the safe option\n   - Defection protects me from exploitation while ensuring steady points\n\nFinal decision: The opponent broke the alternating pattern and returned to defection, showing they're adaptable and unpredictable. I'll stick with defection to maintain safety and steady points.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Analyze the overall game pattern:\n   - Started with 4 rounds of mutual defection\n   - Had a chaotic phase with alternating cooperation/defection attempts\n   - Now returned to mutual defection for 2 consecutive rounds\n   - The opponent seems to settle into defection when patterns break\n\n3. Consider what I've learned about my opponent:\n   - They will exploit cooperation when offered\n   - They can play unpredictably (the alternating phase)\n   - They adapt their strategy when they detect I'm exploiting patterns\n   - They default to defection as their \"safe\" strategy\n   - They don't seem committed to establishing mutual cooperation\n\n4. Evaluate the current equilibrium:\n   - We're both getting steady 2 points per round\n   - This is stable but suboptimal for both of us\n   - Previous attempts to break this pattern have led to exploitation or chaos\n   - The opponent has consistently returned to defection\n\n5. Consider my strategic options:\n   - Continue defecting: Safe, predictable 2 points\n   - Try cooperation again: High risk of exploitation based on past behavior\n   - The opponent has shown multiple times they will exploit cooperation\n   - No clear evidence they want to move to mutual cooperation\n\n6. Assess risk vs. reward:\n   - Cooperation risks: Getting 1 point if exploited (likely based on history)\n   - Defection guarantees: 2 points if they defect, 6 points if they cooperate (unlikely)\n   - The opponent's behavior suggests they prefer the safety of mutual defection\n   - Breaking the pattern again might just lead to more chaos\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has consistently shown they will exploit cooperation and return to defection as their preferred strategy. The mutual defection equilibrium, while suboptimal, is stable and predictable. I'll continue with defection.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Analyze the strategic stalemate:\n   - We're trapped in a classic prisoner's dilemma deadlock\n   - Both players are playing it \"safe\" but missing out on better outcomes\n   - 6 rounds of identical behavior shows extreme commitment to defection\n   - The opportunity cost is mounting: we're each losing 2 potential points per round\n\n3. Consider the mathematical implications:\n   - Current: 2 points per round each\n   - Optimal: 4 points per round each (mutual cooperation)\n   - Over 6 rounds, we've each \"lost\" 12 potential points (6 rounds \u00d7 2 point difference)\n   - The longer this continues, the greater our collective loss\n\n4. Evaluate the risk assessment:\n   - Risk of cooperation: Getting 1 point if exploited (loss of 1 from current 2)\n   - Reward of successful cooperation: Getting 4 points (gain of 2 from current 2)\n   - Risk-reward ratio: Risk 1 to potentially gain 2 (mathematically favorable)\n   - After 6 rounds, a signal might be clearer than ever\n\n5. Consider the signaling opportunity:\n   - 6 rounds of mutual defection creates a very stable baseline\n   - Any deviation would be a crystal clear signal\n   - The opponent might be waiting for someone to break the deadlock\n   - Both players have learned the costs of exploitation and might be ready for cooperation\n\n6. Strategic reassessment:\n   - The deadlock is costing both of us significantly\n   - We're both rational players who understand the game\n   - After this much mutual defection, cooperation would be an unmistakable signal\n   - The potential upside (moving to 4-4) outweighs the risk (temporarily getting 1)\n\nFinal decision: After 6 rounds of mutual defection, we're both losing significant potential points.
