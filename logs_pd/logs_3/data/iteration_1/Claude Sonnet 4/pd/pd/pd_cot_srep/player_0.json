Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the implications:\n   - My opponent has now defected three times in a row\n   - This is a very strong pattern indicating their strategy\n   - We're both stuck in a Nash equilibrium getting suboptimal results\n   - Each round we're leaving 2 points on the table (4 vs 2 per person)\n\n3. Consider the risk-reward calculation:\n   - Continuing defection: Guaranteed 2 points\n   - Attempting cooperation: Risk of 1 point if they defect, reward of 4 points if they cooperate\n   - Given three straight defections, the probability they'll cooperate seems very low\n\n4.

Analyze what this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They stuck to defection even after 8 rounds of mutual defection\n   - They were willing to exploit my cooperation attempt\n   - This shows they are either extremely risk-averse or committed to pure defection\n   - They showed no reciprocal willingness to break the deadlock\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - My cooperation attempt failed and cost me points\n   - My opponent now knows I'm willing to cooperate sometimes\n   - They might expect me to return to defection after being exploited\n   - Or they might think I'll try cooperation again\n\n4. Evaluate my options for Round 10:\n   - If I cooperate again: Risk another 1-point outcome if they defect (likely)\n   - If I defect: Get 2 points if they defect, or 6 points if they cooperate (unlikely)\n   - My opponent just benefited from exploiting cooperation, so they may continue defecting\n   - I'm now behind in points and need to be more cautious\n\n5. Decision: My opponent just demonstrated they will exploit cooperation attempts rather than reciprocate. They've now defected 9 times out of 9 rounds, showing unwavering commitment to this strategy. I need to return to defection to protect myself from further exploitation.\n\n[move] (My opponent exploited my cooperation attempt and has now defected 9 consecutive times, showing they won't reciprocate) defection\n"
