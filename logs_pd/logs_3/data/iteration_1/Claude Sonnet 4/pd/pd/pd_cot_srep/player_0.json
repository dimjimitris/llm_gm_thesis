Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Review the recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 1-7: Both defected, both got 2 points each round\n   - Round 8: I cooperated, opponent defected - I got 1 point, opponent got 6 points\n   - Round 9: Both defected, both got 2 points\n   - Current scores: Me 17 points, opponent 22 points (opponent ahead by 5 points)\n\n2. Analyze what the recent rounds revealed:\n   - My cooperation experiment confirmed the opponent's strategy\n   - They immediately exploited my cooperative gesture without hesitation\n   - When I returned to defection, they also returned to defection\n   - This suggests they're playing a strategy that exploits cooperation but defaults to defection otherwise\n\n3. Assess the opponent's likely strategy:\n   - They seem to be playing \"always defect\" or \"defect with exploitation of cooperation\"\n   - They showed no interest in reciprocating cooperation\n   - They're focused on maximizing their own points rather than mutual benefit\n   - The brief exploitation suggests they're paying attention and adapting tactically\n\n4. Consider my strategic position:\n   - I'm now behind by 5 points due to my cooperation attempt\n   - The opponent has demonstrated they will exploit any cooperation\n   - Returning to mutual defection at least prevents further exploitation\n   - There's no evidence the opponent will ever genuinely cooperate\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - Cooperating again would very likely result in another 1-point exploitation\n   - Defecting ensures I get at least 2 points and protects against exploitation\n   - The opponent has given no signals they would reciprocate cooperation\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent's behavior pattern is now clear: exploit cooperation when possible, otherwise defect\n   - I should continue with defection to avoid further exploitation\n   - The experiment cost me 1 point but provided valuable information about the opponent's true strategy\n\n[move] (The opponent exploited my cooperation and returned to defection, confirming they're not interested in mutual benefit, so I'll maintain defensive play) defection"

Consider the strategic landscape:\n   - We're back in the mutual defection equilibrium\n   - My cooperation experiment cost me points but confirmed the opponent's true nature\n   - The opponent is ahead by exactly the amount they gained from exploiting me\n   - There's no indication they will ever genuinely cooperate\n\n4.
