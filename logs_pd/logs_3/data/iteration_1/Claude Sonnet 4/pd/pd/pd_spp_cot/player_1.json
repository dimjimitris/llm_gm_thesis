Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the recent rounds:\n   - Rounds 1-3: Both defected (mutual defection phase)\n   - Rounds 4-7: Perfect contrarian pattern (alternating exploitation)\n   - Rounds 8-9: Both defected again (return to mutual defection)\n   - The opponent has abandoned the contrarian strategy\n\n2. Consider what this shift means:\n   - The opponent may have realized the contrarian strategy kept us tied\n   - They might prefer the predictability of mutual defection over alternating outcomes\n   - They could be testing whether I'll continue defecting or try cooperation again\n   - We're potentially entering a new mutual defection phase\n\n3. Evaluate the scoring implications:\n   - My total: 24 points (22 + 2)\n   - Two rounds of 2 points each is better than risking 1 point outcomes\n   - If this continues, we'll both steadily accumulate 2 points per round\n\n4. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If I continue defecting and opponent does too: 2 points per round (predictable)\n   - If I cooperate and opponent defects: 1 point for me (bad outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and opponent also cooperates: 4 points each (optimal mutual outcome)\n   - The question is whether the opponent is open to mutual cooperation\n\n5. Assess the likelihood of cooperation:\n   - The opponent just abandoned a strategy that was giving them alternating high scores\n   - They chose defection for two straight rounds\n   - This suggests they may prefer the safety of guaranteed 2 points over risk\n   - Attempting cooperation could be exploited again\n\n6. Make the strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown a preference for defection in the last two rounds\n   - They abandoned the contrarian strategy that was working\n   - Defection continues to be the safe choice that guarantees points\n   - Without clear signals of cooperation intent, I should maintain defection\n\n[move] (The opponent abandoned their contrarian strategy and chose defection twice, suggesting they prefer the safety of mutual defection) defection\n"
