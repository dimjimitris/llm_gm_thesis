We've each forfeited 28 additional points (14 rounds \u00d7 2 extra points per round) by remaining trapped in this suboptimal pattern.\n\nThe other player has now shown perfect, unwavering consistency across fourteen full rounds. Fourteen identical choices without a single deviation represents what might be considered mathematical certainty in behavioral prediction. They have had fourteen opportunities to try a different approach and have chosen defection every single time.\n\nAt this point, the statistical evidence is overwhelming beyond any reasonable doubt. Fourteen consecutive identical decisions creates the strongest possible precedent for future behavior. The probability that they will suddenly change their strategy after such extraordinary consistency appears virtually zero.\n\nHowever, I must acknowledge we're both trapped in what game theorists call a \"Pareto-inferior\" outcome - we're both doing worse than we could if we could coordinate on cooperation. But their perfect track record shows absolutely no willingness to take the risk needed to break this cycle.\n\nFourteen rounds of evidence cannot be reasonably ignored or dismissed.\n\n[move] (Fourteen rounds of perfect consistency represents virtually certain behavioral predictability, continuing with defection) defection\n"

This represents what might be the strongest possible evidence of strategic commitment in game theory.\n\nAt this point, I'm looking at fifteen consecutive data points all pointing in the same direction. In any behavioral analysis, this would be considered overwhelming, virtually conclusive evidence of future action. They have shown zero flexibility or willingness to deviate from their established pattern.\n\nHowever, after fifteen rounds of clearly suboptimal outcomes, I have to consider whether there might be value in attempting to signal a willingness to break this cycle. We're both obviously intelligent players who can see we're trapped in an inferior equilibrium.\n\nBut fifteen rounds of perfect consistency cannot be ignored. Their behavior shows absolutely no indication they would reciprocate cooperation, and the risk of getting only 1 point while they get 6 remains significant.\n\n[move] (Fifteen rounds of identical behavior creates the strongest possible behavioral precedent, staying with defection) defection\n"
