    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My opponent showed they can think strategically (chose defection in round 1)\n2. We're both now aware that mutual defection gives us each only 2 points\n3. Mutual cooperation would give us each 4 points - a better outcome for both\n4. However, if I switch to cooperation and they stick with defection, I only get 1 point while they get 6\n\nThe key question is whether my opponent will recognize that mutual cooperation is superior to mutual defection and be willing to take the risk. Since they demonstrated strategic thinking in round 1, there's a possibility they might switch to cooperation to try to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nHowever, there's also the risk that they'll stick with defection, expecting me to switch to cooperation, which would give them the maximum payoff of 6 points.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the fact that defection still provides security against being exploited, I'll maintain my defensive strategy.\n\n[move] (My opponent also chose defection last round, showing strategic thinking.

We're both stuck in a suboptimal outcome (2,2) when we could achieve (4,4) through mutual cooperation\n3. The pattern suggests my opponent may be locked into a defensive/rational strategy\n4. Continuing this pattern means we'll keep getting 2 points each instead of the possible 4\n\nAt some point, someone needs to break this cycle to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome. However, the risk is significant - if I switch to cooperation and my opponent maintains defection, I get only 1 point while they get 6.\n\nGiven that we've now established a pattern of mutual defection over two rounds, my opponent might:\n- Continue defecting, expecting me to do the same\n- Possibly consider switching to cooperation, recognizing the mutual benefit\n- Try to exploit any cooperation attempt on my part\n\nThe strategic question is whether to take the risk of signaling willingness to cooperate, or continue the safe but suboptimal defection strategy.\n\n[move] (Two rounds of mutual defection suggest we're both playing it safe, but this locks us into a suboptimal outcome.
