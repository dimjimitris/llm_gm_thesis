Consider that this is against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely haven't developed a strategy yet and may not know what to expect.\n\n3. Evaluate the risk vs reward:\n   - If I cooperate: Best case 4 points, worst case 1 point\n   - If I defect: Best case 6 points, worst case 2 points\n\n4. Consider that defection dominates cooperation mathematically - regardless of what the opponent does, defecting gives me a higher payoff than cooperating would in the same situation.\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player who may be more likely to cooperate initially (not yet having learned to be defensive), there's a good chance I can exploit this for the maximum 6 points.\n\n6. The safe floor with defection (2 points) is also better than the worst case with cooperation (1 point).\n\nFinal decision: I should defect to maximize my expected payoff, especially against an inexperienced player.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Assess the strategic certainty: With 14/14 defections, this opponent has established what appears to be an completely unchangeable and fixed strategy of pure defection.\n\n3. Consider the mathematical reality: The probability of this opponent ever cooperating is effectively zero based on such extensive and overwhelming consistent evidence.\n\n4. Evaluate my optimal strategic response:\n   - Defection guarantees 2 points (based on unbreakable established pattern)\n   - Cooperation would almost certainly yield 1 point while giving them 6\n   - Mutual defection at 2-2 is the only realistic and stable outcome\n\n5. Consider any rationale for deviation: With 14 consecutive defections, there is absolutely zero strategic justification for attempting cooperation or changing strategy.\n\n6. Apply fundamental game theory principles: Against a player with a perfect 14-round defection record, defection is categorically the dominant strategy and only rational choice.\n\nFinal decision: Continue defecting as it is the only logical and optimal response to this opponent's completely predictable and immutable defection strategy.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
