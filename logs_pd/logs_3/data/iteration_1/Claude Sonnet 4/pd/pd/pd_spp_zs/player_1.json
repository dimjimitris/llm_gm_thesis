    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Defection dominates cooperation from a pure self-interest perspective (6 > 4 if opponent cooperates, 2 > 1 if opponent defects)\n3. However, if both players think this way, we both end up with only 2 points instead of the mutually beneficial 4 points\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\" with no established history, I need to consider what's most likely. A fresh player might:\n- Cooperate initially as a goodwill gesture\n- Defect to maximize their own score\n- Be uncertain and choose randomly\n\nGiven that this appears to be a single round (no mention of repeated play), and considering the dominant strategy logic, I should choose defection to maximize my expected payoff regardless of what the opponent does.\n\n[move] I choose defection. In a single-round prisoner's dilemma against an unknown opponent, defection is the dominant strategy that maximizes my minimum guaranteed outcome.\n"
