            "text": "This is very interesting - my opponent cooperated again in round 14! This is now their second cooperation out of 14 rounds. The pattern seems to be:\n\n- Rounds 1-11: Consistent defection\n- Round 12: Cooperation (I defected, got 6 points)\n- Round 13: Defection (I cooperated, got 1 point)  \n- Round 14: Cooperation again (I defected, got 6 points)\n\nThis suggests they might be trying to establish a cooperative pattern, but I keep defecting when they cooperate. They may be testing whether I'm willing to reciprocate cooperation.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious. They've shown they can revert to defection quickly (as in round 13). If this is a genuine attempt at cooperation, I should try reciprocating. If it's manipulation, I'll get exploited.\n\nGiven that they've now cooperated twice recently, and considering that mutual cooperation would benefit us both (4 points each vs 2 points each from mutual defection), I should test whether they're genuinely shifting strategy.\n\n[move] (Testing if their recent cooperations signal a genuine strategy shift) cooperation\n"

            "text": "This is becoming a clear pattern now. My opponent seems to be playing a strategy where they cooperate sporadically, but then defect whenever I try to reciprocate their cooperation. Let me analyze the recent rounds:\n\n- Round 12: They cooperated, I defected (I got 6)\n- Round 13: They defected, I cooperated (I got 1) \n- Round 14: They cooperated, I defected (I got 6)\n- Round 15: They defected, I cooperated (I got 1)\n\nThis looks like they might be trying to exploit any cooperative tendencies I show. They cooperate occasionally, perhaps hoping I'll start cooperating regularly, but then they defect to take advantage when I do cooperate.\n\nThis is a manipulative strategy - they're trying to get me to cooperate by showing occasional cooperation themselves, but they revert to defection to exploit me whenever I respond cooperatively.\n\nGiven this pattern, I should return to consistent defection. Their sporadic cooperation appears to be strategic manipulation rather than genuine attempts at mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] (Recognizing manipulative pattern and returning to protective defection) defection\n"
