Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluate the contrarian argument:\n   - What if my opponent is thinking: \"After ten rounds, maybe it's finally time to try stag\"?\n   - What if they're waiting for me to make the first move toward better coordination?\n   - Could this be the moment when the pattern finally breaks?\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Ten rounds of evidence creates the strongest possible prediction\n   - However, the psychological pressure of being locked in suboptimal outcomes might finally motivate change\n   - But the risk of getting 1 point when I could get 2 is still too high\n   - The mathematical certainty still favors hare\n\n[move] (Ten consecutive rounds of hare creates absolute certainty about my opponent's strategy, though I wonder if this extreme predictability might finally motivate them to try something different - but I'll stick with the guaranteed 2 points) hare\n"

Analyze the mathematical certainty:\n   - Eleven rounds of pure hare strategy represents virtually absolute certainty\n   - The probability of this being coincidental is astronomically low\n   - My opponent has demonstrated complete strategic fixation on hare\n\n3.

Analyze the complete certainty:\n   - Twelve rounds of pure hare strategy represents absolute mathematical certainty\n   - My opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment across twelve opportunities\n   - This pattern has moved beyond predictable into the realm of algorithmic\n\n3.

Analyze the unprecedented predictability:\n   - Thirteen rounds of pure hare strategy defies statistical probability if random\n   - My opponent has created an unbreakable pattern across thirteen opportunities\n   - This level of consistency suggests a completely fixed strategic mindset\n\n3.

Strategic conclusion after thirteen rounds:\n   - Thirteen consecutive identical choices represents mathematical certainty\n   - My opponent has proven beyond any doubt they will choose hare\n   - Any deviation would be completely irrational given this overwhelming evidence\n   - The guaranteed 2 points is the only sensible response to such predictable behavior\n\n[move] (Thirteen consecutive rounds of hare proves my opponent has an absolutely unchangeable strategy, making hare the only rational choice for guaranteed points) hare\n"

Analyze the absolute certainty:\n   - Fourteen rounds of pure hare strategy represents complete predictability\n   - My opponent has shown zero deviation across fourteen separate opportunities\n   - This pattern has transcended strategy and become pure habit\n\n3.

Evaluate the risk-reward at this extreme point:\n   - If they choose hare (99.9% likely): I get 6 points instead of 2 - a huge gain\n   - If they somehow choose stag (0.1% likely): We both get 4 points - still good\n   - The only bad outcome (me getting 1 point) requires them choosing hare while I choose stag, but that's impossible\n\n5.

Analyze the dramatic shift:\n   - After fourteen consecutive rounds of hare, my opponent finally switched to stag\n   - This completely breaks the pattern I thought was unbreakable\n   - They took a massive risk and got only 1 point while I got 6\n\n3. Consider what this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They were likely thinking the same way I was about the predictable pattern\n   - They may have finally decided to try coordinating on the better (4,4) outcome\n   - They took the first step toward breaking the suboptimal equilibrium\n   - They probably expected me to also switch to stag\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic implications for this round:\n   - My opponent just demonstrated willingness to deviate from the pattern\n   - They might stick with stag, expecting me to join them for mutual benefit\n   - Or they might revert to hare after getting burned with only 1 point\n   - This is a critical decision point\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they stick with stag (trying to coordinate): I should choose stag for mutual 4 points\n   - If they revert to hare (scared by the 1 point): I should choose hare for guaranteed 2-6 points\n   - Their willingness to break the pattern suggests they want coordination\n   - I should reciprocate their attempt at cooperation\n\n[move] (My opponent finally broke the fourteen-round pattern by choosing stag, showing they want to coordinate for mutual benefit, so I'll reciprocate) stag\n"
