My opponent has locked into this strategy with mathematical precision. There is zero probability they will deviate from hare at this point.\n\nWe have reached the most stable possible equilibrium in this game - both players automatically choosing hare for a guaranteed 2 points each round. While this isn't the theoretically optimal outcome (mutual stag would give 4 points each), my opponent's unwavering commitment to risk avoidance has made that impossible.\n\nAfter fourteen rounds of identical behavior, choosing anything other than hare would be strategically irrational. I would be guaranteed to lose a point (getting 1 instead of 2) with absolutely no upside potential.\n\n[move] (Fourteen consecutive hare moves represents complete strategic certainty, maintaining the established mutual hare equilibrium) hare\n"
