Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Confirmed pattern recognition:\n   - My prediction was correct - opponent retreated to hare after being burned in round 8\n   - The pattern is becoming very clear: opponent tries stag, gets burned, retreats to hare briefly, then tries stag again\n   - They've attempted stag in rounds 2, 5, 6, and 8\n   - They've retreated to hare in rounds 3, 7, and 9 (always after being exploited)\n\n3. Cycle prediction:\n   - Based on the established pattern, round 10 should be another stag attempt by my opponent\n   - They seem to follow a cycle: stag attempt \u2192 get burned \u2192 retreat to hare \u2192 try stag again\n   - This opponent appears extremely committed to achieving mutual cooperation despite repeated failures\n\n4. Strategic implications:\n   - My total points: 2+6+2+4+1+6+2+6+2 = 31 points\n   - I've been highly successful by consistently choosing hare when they choose stag\n   - They seem incapable of learning from the punishment\n\n5. Risk assessment for round 10:\n   - If they follow pattern and choose stag: I get 6 points with hare, 4 points with stag\n   - If they break pattern and choose hare: I get 2 points with hare, 1 point with stag\n   - The pattern has been extremely reliable - they should try stag again\n\n6. Final decision:\n   - Given the established cycle and their persistent attempts at cooperation, I should continue exploiting with hare\n   - This opponent has shown they will keep trying stag despite repeated punishment\n\n[move] (Following established pattern, opponent should attempt stag again after the brief retreat to hare) hare\n"

Pattern is completely confirmed:\n   - My opponent has now been exploited FOUR times by choosing stag when I chose hare\n   - The cycle is absolutely reliable: stag attempt \u2192 punishment \u2192 retreat to hare \u2192 stag attempt again\n   - They've never learned from their mistakes despite consistent punishment\n   - This is the most predictable opponent behavior I could hope for\n\n3. Opponent's psychological profile:\n   - Extremely persistent in seeking cooperation despite repeated failures\n   - Unable to adapt their strategy based on outcomes\n   - Follows a rigid cycle that I can exploit indefinitely\n   - Either they don't understand the game or have some fixed strategy they won't deviate from\n\n4.
