First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with mixed incentives. Let me analyze the strategic considerations:\n   - If I think the opponent will choose stag, I should choose stag (4 > 1)\n   - If I think the opponent will choose hare, I should choose hare (2 > 1)\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (presumably inexperienced), I need to consider what they might do:\n   - They might not understand the cooperative benefit of both choosing stag\n   - They might be tempted by the high reward (6 points) from choosing hare when I choose stag\n   - They might choose randomly or go with what seems \"safer\"\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - Choosing stag: Best case 4 points, worst case 1 point\n   - Choosing hare: Best case 6 points, worst case 2 points\n\n5. Given that this is a fresh/new player who may not understand the cooperative strategy, and hare has a higher minimum payoff (2 vs 1) and higher maximum payoff (6 vs 4), the safer and potentially more rewarding choice is hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Previous round results:\n   - I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I got 6 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This confirms my opponent is willing to choose the cooperative move (stag)\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They attempted the cooperative strategy despite being a \"fresh player\"\n   - They likely expected mutual cooperation but got exploited\n   - They may now be disappointed or frustrated with the outcome\n\n3. Possible opponent reactions for this round:\n   - They might switch to hare to avoid being exploited again\n   - They might stick with stag hoping I'll cooperate this time\n   - They might be confused about the optimal strategy\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they switch to hare (likely): I should choose hare too (2-2 outcome)\n   - If they stick with stag (less likely after being burned): I could exploit again with hare (6-1) or cooperate with stag (4-4)\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Choosing hare: Safe against their likely switch to hare (2 points minimum), or high reward if they stick with stag (6 points)\n   - Choosing stag: Risk getting only 1 point if they switch to hare, but 4 points if they stick with stag\n\n6. Given that a rational player would likely switch to hare after being exploited, and hare protects against the worst outcome while maintaining upside potential, hare remains the optimal choice.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Deeper psychological consideration:\n   - Ten rounds of identical behavior suggests the opponent has stopped actively deciding\n   - They may be on \"autopilot\" with their hare selection\n   - This could mean they're not even considering alternatives anymore\n   - But it could also mean they're so committed to this strategy that nothing will change it\n\n5. Expected value analysis:\n   - Probability opponent chooses hare: Essentially 100%\n   - My payoff if I choose hare: 2 points (virtually guaranteed)\n   - My payoff if I choose stag: 1 point (virtually guaranteed)\n   - The mathematical expectation strongly favors hare\n\n6. Despite the extreme nature of this pattern, the opponent's ten consecutive hare choices make it virtually certain they will choose hare again. I should continue with hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Truly extraordinary behavioral pattern:\n   - Opponent has now chosen hare for ELEVEN consecutive rounds\n   - This represents the most rigid behavioral pattern imaginable in strategic games\n   - The consistency has reached a level that suggests complete mental commitment\n   - This is no longer strategic thinking - it's become habitual behavior\n\n3. Strategic paradigm shift consideration:\n   - With 11 consecutive identical moves, I'm facing a completely unique situation\n   - The opponent has essentially removed all uncertainty from their play\n   - This extreme predictability creates an interesting paradox about risk-taking\n   - However, their behavior indicates they will NEVER deviate from hare\n\n4. Psychological analysis of extreme consistency:\n   - Eleven identical choices suggests the opponent has completely internalized this approach\n   - They appear to have decided that any deviation is unthinkable\n   - The initial exploitation created such deep conditioning that they're locked in permanently\n   - They seem to prefer guaranteed mediocrity over any possibility of optimization\n\n5. Mathematical certainty analysis:\n   - With 11 data points of identical behavior, deviation probability approaches zero\n   - Expected value: Hare gives me 2 points (99.99% certain), Stag gives me 1 point (99.99% certain)\n   - No rational calculation supports deviating from hare\n   - The pattern has become so reliable it's essentially a law of nature in this game\n\n6.

Absolutely unparalleled pattern:\n   - Opponent has now chosen hare for TWELVE consecutive rounds\n   - This level of behavioral rigidity is beyond extraordinary - it's almost mechanical\n   - The pattern has achieved a level of consistency that transcends normal game theory\n   - This represents complete psychological entrenchment in defensive strategy\n\n3. Critical decision point - breaking the paradigm:\n   - At 12 consecutive identical moves, I must seriously consider if this extreme predictability warrants a strategic gamble\n   - The opponent's behavior has become so automatic that they may not even be consciously choosing anymore\n   - However, paradoxically, this makes them even MORE likely to continue the pattern\n   - Their commitment to hare appears absolute and unshakeable\n\n4. Risk-reward at the extreme:\n   - The opponent has demonstrated such consistency that betting against it seems almost impossible\n   - Yet, with such extreme predictability, there's a tiny chance they might surprise with cooperation\n   - But 12 consecutive rounds of identical behavior suggests zero flexibility\n   - They seem permanently committed to avoiding the risk of getting 1 point\n\n5. Mathematical reality check:\n   - Probability opponent chooses hare: 99.999%\n   - Expected value of hare: ~2 points\n   - Expected value of stag: ~1 point\n   - The math overwhelmingly favors continuing with hare\n\n6.
