    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

They chose the safer option in round 1, which could mean:\n1. They're risk-averse and will continue choosing hare\n2. They were being cautious initially but might switch strategies\n3. They're thinking similarly to me about game theory\n\nIf they continue with hare, we'll both get 2 points again. However, if I think they might stick with the safe choice, I could exploit this by choosing stag (getting 1 point if they choose hare) or matching their hare choice for another 2 points.\n\nBut there's also the possibility they're thinking one level ahead - expecting me to think they'll choose hare again, so they might switch to stag to get 6 points if I choose hare.\n\nGiven that we both played conservatively in round 1, I think there's a reasonable chance they might be willing to try cooperation (stag) this round, especially since the mutual cooperation outcome (4 points each) is better than what we just achieved.\n\n[move] (The opponent showed conservative play in round 1, so they might be willing to try mutual cooperation for the better 4-point outcome) stag\n"
