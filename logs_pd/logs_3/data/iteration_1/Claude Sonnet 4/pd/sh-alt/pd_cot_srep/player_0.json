Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This shows a consistent pattern from my opponent.\n\n2. Opponent behavior analysis:\n   - They've chosen hare twice in a row\n   - They seem to prefer the safe, guaranteed 2 points over risking cooperation or exploitation\n   - This suggests they're playing a conservative, risk-averse strategy\n\n3. Predicting opponent's round 3 behavior:\n   - They might continue with hare since it's been \"working\" (safe 2 points)\n   - They might finally try stag, thinking I'm locked into the hare pattern and they can exploit me for 6 points\n   - The longer we both play hare, the more tempting it becomes for them to switch to stag\n\n4. My strategic considerations:\n   - If they stick with hare again: hare gets me 2, stag gets me 1\n   - If they switch to stag: hare gets me 6, stag gets me 4\n   - The key question is: are they likely to break the pattern?\n\n5.

Strategic considerations for round 4:\n   - The pattern is so established that it might be creating complacency\n   - My opponent might finally be tempted to break the pattern and choose stag to exploit what they expect will be another hare from me\n   - Alternatively, they might be completely locked into the hare strategy\n\n4. Payoff analysis if I switch to stag:\n   - If opponent sticks with hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 (bad for me)\n   - If opponent switches to stag: I get 4 points, they get 4 (good mutual outcome)\n\n5.

Opponent profile:\n   - They have chosen hare in 100% of rounds (6/6)\n   - This level of consistency is beyond normal risk-aversion - it suggests they may be completely committed to this single strategy\n   - They have passed up multiple opportunities to exploit what appears to be my predictable behavior\n\n3.
