First, let me understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key insight is that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives a good outcome for both players (4 points each).\n\n3. However, there's a risk-reward consideration:\n   - If I choose stag and my opponent also chooses stag, I get 4 points (good)\n   - If I choose stag and my opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point (bad)\n   - If I choose hare and my opponent chooses stag, I get 6 points (excellent)\n   - If I choose hare and my opponent chooses hare, I get 2 points (okay)\n\n4. Since this is a \"fresh player\" (first time), they likely haven't developed a strategy yet. Fresh players might:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Go for the safe option (hare, which guarantees at least 2 points)\n   - Or try to be cooperative (stag)\n\n5. The hare choice is \"safer\" because it guarantees at least 2 points and has the potential for 6 points if the opponent chooses stag. The stag choice is riskier but can lead to mutual benefit.\n\n6. Given that this is against a fresh player who might be cautious or unpredictable, I should choose the option that maximizes my minimum guaranteed outcome while still having upside potential.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare because it gives me a guaranteed minimum of 2 points and the potential for 6 points if my opponent tries to be cooperative with stag.\n\n[move] hare\n"

This tells me something about my opponent's strategy:\n   - They also chose the \"safer\" option like I did\n   - They might be risk-averse or thinking similarly to me\n   - Since they're a \"fresh player,\" they may have chosen hare as the conservative choice\n\n3. Now I need to consider my strategy for round 2:\n   - My opponent now knows that I chose hare in round 1\n   - They might expect me to choose hare again\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to try to exploit them\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If my opponent sticks with hare (thinking it's safe), and I switch to stag, I get 1 point (worse than the 2 I just got)\n   - If my opponent switches to stag (trying to cooperate or exploit), and I stick with hare, I get 6 points (excellent)\n   - If we both switch to stag, we both get 4 points (better than the 2 we just got)\n   - If we both stick with hare, we get 2 points again\n\n5. Since my opponent chose hare in round 1 (the safe choice), they might:\n   - Continue with hare (playing it safe)\n   - Switch to stag (trying for better mutual outcome or hoping I'll cooperate)\n\n6. Given that hare worked defensively last round and my opponent showed risk-averse behavior, I should consider that they might try stag this round for a better outcome, especially since mutual hare only gave us 2 points each.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare again because if my opponent switches to stag (which is likely given the low payoff last round), I'll get 6 points.

The risk assessment:\n   - Choosing hare again: Safe 2 points minimum, potential 6 if opponent switches\n   - Choosing stag: Risk of only 1 point if opponent sticks with hare, but potential 4 if they also switch\n\n7. Since my opponent has shown very conservative behavior, I should continue exploiting this by choosing hare, which gives me the best expected outcome against a hare-choosing opponent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll stick with hare because my opponent has established a clear pattern of risk-averse play, and hare gives me the best protection against their likely continued choice of hare while maintaining upside if they switch.\n\n[move] hare\n"

The problem with our current equilibrium:\n   - We're both consistently getting only 2 points per round\n   - This is suboptimal - we could both be getting 4 points per round if we cooperated with stag\n   - But the risk is that if I switch to stag and they stick with hare, I only get 1 point\n\n4.

My opponent has now chosen hare FOUR times in a row. This is an extremely strong pattern that suggests:\n   - They are completely locked into a risk-averse strategy\n   - They may not be adapting or learning from the suboptimal outcomes\n   - They might be playing a purely defensive strategy regardless of circumstances\n\n3. The mutual hare trap:\n   - We're both stuck getting only 2 points per round\n   - We've missed out on potential cooperative gains (4 points each with mutual stag)\n   - But attempting cooperation is risky given their predictable defensive play\n\n4.

My opponent has chosen hare FIVE consecutive times. This suggests:\n   - They are absolutely committed to the risk-averse strategy\n   - They may be playing a fixed strategy regardless of outcomes\n   - They might not be capable of or willing to adapt\n   - The probability they'll choose hare again is extremely high (maybe 98%+)\n\n3. The stagnation problem:\n   - We're trapped in a suboptimal equilibrium\n   - Both getting 2 points per round when we could get 4 each with cooperation\n   - But my opponent's rigidity makes cooperation extremely risky for me\n\n4. However, I need to consider a new angle:\n   - What if my opponent is also thinking the same way I am?\n   - What if they're also analyzing my pattern and considering a switch?\n   - After 5 rounds of mutual hare, they might finally realize we need to break this cycle\n\n5.

My opponent has now chosen hare TEN times in a row. This is:\n   - Statistically extraordinary (probability of random occurrence would be 0.5^10 = ~0.1%)\n   - Definitive proof they are following a completely fixed strategy\n   - Beyond any reasonable explanation except complete inflexibility\n   - They will choose hare with mathematical certainty\n\n3. The staggering cumulative cost:\n   - If we had cooperated with mutual stag, we'd each have 40 points instead of 20\n   - We've each lost 20 potential points to this pattern\n   - This represents a 50% opportunity cost that continues to compound\n\n4. Meta-game analysis:\n   - This is no longer a strategic game between thinking opponents\n   - I'm playing against what is effectively a \"hare machine\"\n   - My opponent has demonstrated absolute zero adaptability\n   - Ten rounds is more than enough data to confirm their complete predictability\n\n5. The undeniable mathematical reality:\n   - My opponent will choose hare (100% certainty)\n   - Against hare, my options yield:\n   - Hare: 2 points (guaranteed)\n   - Stag: 1 point (guaranteed)\n   - The choice is mathematically trivial\n\n6. Final strategic assessment:\n   - My opponent is completely predictable and inflexible\n   - Any deviation from hare would voluntarily reduce my score\n   - Exploiting their predictability is the only rational approach\n   - This pattern could continue indefinitely with the same result\n\n7. At this point, continuing with hare isn't even strategic thinking - it's just mathematical optimization against a known constant.\n\nFinal decision: Ten consecutive identical rounds definitively proves my opponent will always choose hare.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
