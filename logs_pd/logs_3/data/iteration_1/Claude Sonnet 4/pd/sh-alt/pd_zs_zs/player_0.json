This level of predictability is extraordinary - they have never wavered from their strategy even once.\n\nAt this point, I'm considering whether I should try a different approach. While the data overwhelmingly suggests they'll continue with hare, perhaps after so many rounds of stable 2-point outcomes, they might be open to the mutual benefit of both choosing stag (4 points each).\n\nHowever, the risk-reward calculation still heavily favors hare. With fourteen rounds of evidence showing their unwavering commitment to hare, choosing stag would almost certainly result in me getting 1 point while they get 6. The predictable 2 points from hare remains the rational choice.\n\n[move] (Fourteen rounds of perfect hare consistency shows opponent's strategy is completely fixed, continuing safe matching approach) hare"

This is an absolutely unwavering strategy that appears completely locked in.\n\nAt this point, I'm starting to consider whether I should occasionally try stag just to break the monotony, even though it will almost certainly cost me points. Fifteen rounds of identical play suggests we're in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium - we could both be getting 4 points if we cooperated, but instead we're both stuck at 2 points.\n\nHowever, the mathematical reality remains clear: with fifteen rounds of evidence showing their complete commitment to hare, choosing stag would almost guarantee me only 1 point while giving them 6. The safe, rational choice continues to be hare for the reliable 2 points.\n\n[move] (Fifteen rounds of unwavering hare choices confirms opponent's permanently fixed strategy, maintaining steady approach) hare"
