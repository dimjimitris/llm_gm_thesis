This level of behavioral consistency is remarkable and indicates they have completely settled into a fixed strategy with no willingness to experiment or adapt.\n\nWe've established what appears to be a permanent game state. My opponent's early cooperation attempt was so decisively punished that they've chosen safety for twelve straight rounds without any consideration of alternative approaches. This demonstrates extreme loss aversion - they're willing to accept a guaranteed suboptimal outcome rather than risk the possibility of an even worse one.\n\nThe psychological impact of that single exploitation in round 2 has created an unbreachable barrier to cooperation. While both players could benefit from mutual stag choices (4 points each), my opponent's absolute commitment to risk avoidance makes this impossible.\n\nMy strategy continues to be optimal against this completely predictable opponent.\n\n[move] (My opponent has demonstrated twelve consecutive rounds of identical behavior, showing they are permanently locked into their safe strategy) hare"
