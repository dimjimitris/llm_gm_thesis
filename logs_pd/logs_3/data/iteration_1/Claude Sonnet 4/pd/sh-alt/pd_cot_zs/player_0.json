Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - They might be cautious or aggressive\n\n3. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 6 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice but risky if the opponent defects\n   - Hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) and has potential for high reward (6 points)\n\n5. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" who is unpredictable, and hare gives me both a higher floor (2 vs 1) and higher ceiling (6 vs 4), the safer and potentially more rewarding choice is hare.\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maximize expected value against an unpredictable opponent.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review what happened in Round 1:\n   - I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I got 6 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This tells me the opponent tried the cooperative approach first\n\n2. Consider what the opponent might do now:\n   - They just got punished (1 point) for choosing stag while I chose hare\n   - They might learn from this and switch to hare to avoid being exploited again\n   - Or they might stick with stag hoping I'll cooperate this time\n   - Fresh players often react to immediate feedback\n\n3. Analyze my options for Round 2:\n   - If I choose stag: I get 4 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they switch to hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I get 2 points (if they switch to hare) or 6 points (if they stick with stag)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent just experienced the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Fresh players often learn quickly from bad outcomes\n   - They're likely to switch to hare to protect themselves\n   - If they switch to hare and I choose hare, we both get 2 points\n   - If they switch to hare and I choose stag, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n\n5. Expected value calculation:\n   - Hare seems safer since it protects me from the worst outcome\n   - Even if we both choose hare (likely scenario), 2 points is acceptable\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare again, as the opponent likely learned from Round 1 and will switch to the safer option.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Consider what the opponent might do in Round 3:\n   - They just had a \"safe\" round with 2 points\n   - They might stick with hare since it worked (no punishment)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to stag now, making their stag choice profitable\n   - Fresh players often develop simple patterns after a few rounds\n\n4.

Strategic reasoning for Round 4:\n   - If opponent continues with hare (likely): Stag gives me 1, Hare gives me 2\n   - If opponent switches to stag: Stag gives me 4, Hare gives me 6\n   - The opponent has shown strong preference for safety after Round 1\n   - However, they might eventually realize that mutual cooperation (both stag) gives 4 points each\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - The opponent seems very committed to the defensive hare strategy\n   - Breaking this pattern by choosing stag is very risky (could get only 1 point)\n   - Staying with hare maintains the steady 2 points and protects against their potential switch\n\nFinal decision: Stick with hare again, as the opponent has demonstrated a strong defensive pattern and breaking it now seems too risky.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the established equilibrium:\n   - We've been in a mutual hare pattern for 3 consecutive rounds\n   - The opponent has completely settled into defensive play after Round 1\n   - This is a stable but suboptimal Nash equilibrium\n\n3. Consider if the pattern might change:\n   - The opponent might be getting frustrated with only 2 points per round\n   - They might realize that mutual stag cooperation would give us both 4 points\n   - However, they've shown extreme risk aversion after being burned in Round 1\n   - Fresh players often stick with patterns that feel \"safe\"\n\n4. Strategic considerations for Round 5:\n   - If I switch to stag and they stick with hare: I get 1 point (very bad)\n   - If I switch to stag and they also switch to stag: We both get 4 points (good)\n   - If I stay with hare: I'm guaranteed at least 2 points, possibly 6 if they switch\n\n5. Risk-benefit analysis:\n   - The opponent has chosen hare 3 rounds straight - this is a very strong pattern\n   - Breaking this pattern by choosing stag carries high risk of getting only 1 point\n   - The opponent seems too risk-averse to attempt cooperation after their Round 1 experience\n   - Maintaining hare keeps me safe and maintains my point advantage\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare, as the opponent has demonstrated an extremely consistent defensive pattern that's unlikely to change.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the extremely consistent pattern:\n   - The opponent has now chosen hare 4 consecutive times after Round 1\n   - This is beyond just being cautious - this is a deeply entrenched defensive strategy\n   - They seem completely committed to avoiding the 1-point outcome at all costs\n\n3.

Evaluate potential for change:\n   - After 4 identical rounds, the opponent might be on autopilot with hare\n   - However, they might also be thinking the same as me - that this pattern is predictable\n   - The question is: are they risk-averse enough to stick with hare even if they suspect I might switch?\n\n5.

Review the complete pattern:\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 6, opponent got 1\n   - Rounds 2-5: Both chose hare \u2192 Both got 2 points each (4 rounds)\n   - Round 6: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 6, opponent got 1\n   - Rounds 7-10: Both chose hare \u2192 Both got 2 points each (4 rounds)\n   - Total so far: I have 28 points, opponent has 18 points\n\n2. Analyze the updated behavioral pattern:\n   - After Round 1 punishment: 4 rounds of hare, then tried stag in Round 6\n   - After Round 6 punishment: now 4 rounds of hare completed\n   - This creates a perfect parallel to their previous cycle\n   - Last time, Round 6 (after 4 defensive rounds) was when they switched to stag\n\n3. Strong prediction for Round 11:\n   - The pattern is remarkably consistent: 4 rounds of defensive hare after each punishment\n   - If they follow the exact same pattern, Round 11 should be when they attempt stag again\n   - They've now \"served their defensive time\" and might be ready to test cooperation\n   - The cyclical nature suggests they're following a predictable strategy\n\n4. Strategic implications:\n   - If they choose stag in Round 11 (highly likely based on pattern): My hare gives me 6 points\n   - If they break their pattern and choose hare: My hare gives me 2 points\n   - My 10-point lead (28 vs 18) means I can afford to capitalize on their predictability\n   - This could be the perfect opportunity to extend my lead significantly\n\n5. Strategic decision for Round 11:\n   - The pattern strongly suggests they'll attempt stag cooperation\n   - My hare choice would exploit this perfectly, giving me 6 points while they get 1\n   - Even if I'm wrong and they choose hare, I still get 2 points and maintain my lead\n   - The risk-reward is overwhelmingly in favor of choosing hare\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare, as the opponent's established pattern strongly suggests they'll attempt stag cooperation in Round 11, which I can exploit for maximum points.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the pattern deviation:\n   - Previously: 4 rounds of hare after punishment, then stag attempt\n   - Currently: 5 rounds of hare after Round 6 punishment, still choosing hare\n   - The opponent has broken their previous pattern by extending the defensive period\n   - This suggests they've become even more risk-averse after being burned twice\n\n3. Consider what this pattern change means:\n   - The double punishment has made them more cautious than before\n   - They may have extended their defensive period indefinitely\n   - Or they might be building up even more \"courage\" before the next stag attempt\n   - They could be waiting for a longer safe streak before risking cooperation again\n\n4. Evaluate the current game state:\n   - My lead is now exactly 10 points (30 vs 20)\n   - We've been in mutual hare equilibrium for 5 consecutive rounds\n   - The opponent seems to have settled into an even more defensive pattern\n   - They might never attempt stag again, having learned it leads to punishment\n\n5. Strategic decision for Round 12:\n   - The opponent appears to have become permanently defensive after two punishments\n   - They've already exceeded their previous defensive period by one round\n   - Continuing with hare maintains my steady 2-point advantage each round\n   - There's no strong indication they'll switch to stag anytime soon\n   - My comfortable lead means I can afford to keep exploiting their defensive mindset\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare again, as the opponent has become even more risk-averse and is likely to continue their extended defensive pattern.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the prolonged defensive pattern:\n   - The opponent has now chosen hare for 6 consecutive rounds after their last punishment\n   - This is 50% longer than their previous defensive period (4 rounds)\n   - They appear to have become permanently risk-averse after being burned twice\n   - The pattern suggests they may never attempt stag cooperation again\n\n3. Consider the strategic landscape:\n   - My 10-point lead remains constant (32 vs 22)\n   - We're locked in a stable mutual hare equilibrium\n   - The opponent shows no signs of breaking out of defensive play\n   - This could continue indefinitely at 2 points per round each\n\n4. Evaluate potential for strategic change:\n   - The opponent's extreme caution suggests they prioritize avoiding the 1-point outcome above all else\n   - They seem to have learned that attempting stag leads to punishment\n   - My consistent hare choices have trained them to expect defection\n   - Breaking this pattern by choosing stag would be extremely risky\n\n5. Strategic decision for Round 13:\n   - The opponent has shown zero inclination to deviate from hare after 6 rounds\n   - They appear to be in a permanent defensive mindset\n   - Choosing hare maintains my lead and avoids the risk of getting only 1 point\n   - There's no compelling reason to change a strategy that's maintaining my advantage\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare, as the opponent has demonstrated an entrenched defensive pattern with no signs of change.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Strategic decision for Round 14:\n   - The opponent's behavior has become completely predictable after 7 identical rounds\n   - They show absolutely no signs of attempting cooperation again\n   - Maintaining hare guarantees me 2 points and preserves my lead\n   - There's no strategic benefit to changing when I'm ahead and they're predictable\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare again, as the opponent has demonstrated an unbreakable defensive pattern and changing would only introduce unnecessary risk.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Consider the psychological dynamics:\n   - The opponent has been \"trained\" by two punishments that stag leads to bad outcomes\n   - Eight consecutive safe rounds have reinforced their defensive strategy\n   - They likely view our mutual hare equilibrium as the safest possible outcome\n   - Breaking this pattern would require them to overcome significant psychological conditioning\n\n4. Evaluate the current strategic situation:\n   - My 10-point lead is rock solid and consistent (36 vs 26)\n   - The game has reached a completely stable equilibrium\n   - The opponent shows zero signs of strategic variation after 8 identical rounds\n   - My strategy is working perfectly - maintaining advantage with zero risk\n\n5.
