There are two Nash equilibria:\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag): 4 points each\n   - Mutual defection (both hare): 2 points each\n\n3. **Consider the opponent:**\n   The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player\" - likely someone new who hasn't developed a specific strategy yet.\n\n4. **Evaluate risk vs reward:**\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 4 points (if opponent cooperates), worst case 1 point (if opponent defects)\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 6 points (if opponent cooperates), worst case 2 points (if opponent defects)\n\n5. **Strategic reasoning:**\n   - Hare is the safer choice with a higher floor (2 vs 1) and higher ceiling (6 vs 4)\n   - Against an unknown/fresh player, they might be cautious and choose the safer hare option\n   - If they choose hare and I choose hare, we both get 2 points\n   - If they choose stag and I choose hare, I get the maximum 6 points\n\n6. **Final decision:**\n   Given the uncertainty about the opponent's strategy and the better risk-reward profile of hare, I should choose hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"
