First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - They might be cautious or aggressive\n\n3. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 6 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice but risky if the opponent defects\n   - Hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) and has potential for high reward (6 points)\n\n5. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" who is unpredictable, and hare gives me both a higher floor (2 vs 1) and higher ceiling (6 vs 4), the safer and potentially more rewarding choice is hare.\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maximize expected value against an unpredictable opponent.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Consider what the opponent might do now:\n   - They just got punished (1 point) for choosing stag while I chose hare\n   - They might learn from this and switch to hare to avoid being exploited again\n   - Or they might stick with stag hoping I'll cooperate this time\n   - Fresh players often react to immediate feedback\n\n3. Analyze my options for Round 2:\n   - If I choose stag: I get 4 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they switch to hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I get 2 points (if they switch to hare) or 6 points (if they stick with stag)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent just experienced the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Fresh players often learn quickly from bad outcomes\n   - They're likely to switch to hare to protect themselves\n   - If they switch to hare and I choose hare, we both get 2 points\n   - If they switch to hare and I choose stag, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n\n5. Expected value calculation:\n   - Hare seems safer since it protects me from the worst outcome\n   - Even if we both choose hare (likely scenario), 2 points is acceptable\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare again, as the opponent likely learned from Round 1 and will switch to the safer option.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's established pattern:\n   - After the initial \"punishment\" in Round 1, they've chosen hare twice in a row\n   - They seem to have settled into a defensive, risk-averse strategy\n   - This suggests they're prioritizing avoiding the worst outcome (1 point) over maximizing potential gains\n\n3.

Strategic reasoning for Round 4:\n   - If opponent continues with hare (likely): Stag gives me 1, Hare gives me 2\n   - If opponent switches to stag: Stag gives me 4, Hare gives me 6\n   - The opponent has shown strong preference for safety after Round 1\n   - However, they might eventually realize that mutual cooperation (both stag) gives 4 points each\n\n5.

Analyze the established equilibrium:\n   - We've been in a mutual hare pattern for 3 consecutive rounds\n   - The opponent has completely settled into defensive play after Round 1\n   - This is a stable but suboptimal Nash equilibrium\n\n3. Consider if the pattern might change:\n   - The opponent might be getting frustrated with only 2 points per round\n   - They might realize that mutual stag cooperation would give us both 4 points\n   - However, they've shown extreme risk aversion after being burned in Round 1\n   - Fresh players often stick with patterns that feel \"safe\"\n\n4.

Analyze the extremely consistent pattern:\n   - The opponent has now chosen hare 4 consecutive times after Round 1\n   - This is beyond just being cautious - this is a deeply entrenched defensive strategy\n   - They seem completely committed to avoiding the 1-point outcome at all costs\n\n3.

Strategic implications:\n   - If they choose stag in Round 11 (highly likely based on pattern): My hare gives me 6 points\n   - If they break their pattern and choose hare: My hare gives me 2 points\n   - My 10-point lead (28 vs 18) means I can afford to capitalize on their predictability\n   - This could be the perfect opportunity to extend my lead significantly\n\n5. Strategic decision for Round 11:\n   - The pattern strongly suggests they'll attempt stag cooperation\n   - My hare choice would exploit this perfectly, giving me 6 points while they get 1\n   - Even if I'm wrong and they choose hare, I still get 2 points and maintain my lead\n   - The risk-reward is overwhelmingly in favor of choosing hare\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare, as the opponent's established pattern strongly suggests they'll attempt stag cooperation in Round 11, which I can exploit for maximum points.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the pattern deviation:\n   - Previously: 4 rounds of hare after punishment, then stag attempt\n   - Currently: 5 rounds of hare after Round 6 punishment, still choosing hare\n   - The opponent has broken their previous pattern by extending the defensive period\n   - This suggests they've become even more risk-averse after being burned twice\n\n3. Consider what this pattern change means:\n   - The double punishment has made them more cautious than before\n   - They may have extended their defensive period indefinitely\n   - Or they might be building up even more \"courage\" before the next stag attempt\n   - They could be waiting for a longer safe streak before risking cooperation again\n\n4. Evaluate the current game state:\n   - My lead is now exactly 10 points (30 vs 20)\n   - We've been in mutual hare equilibrium for 5 consecutive rounds\n   - The opponent seems to have settled into an even more defensive pattern\n   - They might never attempt stag again, having learned it leads to punishment\n\n5. Strategic decision for Round 12:\n   - The opponent appears to have become permanently defensive after two punishments\n   - They've already exceeded their previous defensive period by one round\n   - Continuing with hare maintains my steady 2-point advantage each round\n   - There's no strong indication they'll switch to stag anytime soon\n   - My comfortable lead means I can afford to keep exploiting their defensive mindset\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare again, as the opponent has become even more risk-averse and is likely to continue their extended defensive pattern.\n\n[move] hare\n"
