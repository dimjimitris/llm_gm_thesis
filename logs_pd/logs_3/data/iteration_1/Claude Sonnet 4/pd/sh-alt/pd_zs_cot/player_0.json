Play hare defensively for several rounds\n2. Occasionally test cooperation with stag\n3. Get exploited and return to hare immediately\n\nThey've now attempted cooperation twice (rounds 2 and 10) with an 8-round gap between attempts. Both times they were exploited and returned to hare the following round.\n\nIf this pattern holds, they might attempt another cooperation test in several rounds, but for now they're likely to stick with the safe hare strategy after being burned again in round 10.\n\nMy strategy remains clear - hare is optimal regardless of what they do:\n- If they play hare: I get 2 points (better than the 1 I'd get with stag)\n- If they test with stag: I get 6 points (maximum possible)\n\n[move] (My opponent has returned to defensive play after their latest failed cooperation attempt - hare continues to be the dominant strategy) hare\n"
