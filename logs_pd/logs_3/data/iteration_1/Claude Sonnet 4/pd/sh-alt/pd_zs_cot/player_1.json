Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both chose hare, both got 2 points\n   - Round 2: I chose hare, opponent chose stag, I got 6 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - Round 3-8: Both chose hare, both got 2 points each round\n   - Round 9: I chose stag, opponent chose hare, I got 1 point, opponent got 6 points\n\n2. Analyze what just occurred:\n   - I broke the pattern by choosing stag for cooperation\n   - The opponent maintained their defensive hare strategy\n   - They got rewarded with 6 points while I got punished with 1 point\n   - This confirms their extremely risk-averse, defensive approach\n\n3. Consider the opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just got a huge reward (6 points) for sticking with their strategy\n   - This will likely reinforce their belief that hare is the correct choice\n   - They saw me attempt cooperation and successfully exploited it\n   - They're probably feeling vindicated about their defensive approach\n\n4. Evaluate the current situation:\n   - Current totals: Me 21 points, opponent 21 points - we're now tied!\n   - The opponent just caught up completely due to my cooperative attempt\n   - They've learned that patience with hare pays off when the opponent tries to cooperate\n   - They have no incentive to change their strategy now\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just got massively rewarded for their defensive strategy\n   - They will almost certainly stick with hare after this success\n   - I need to return to the defensive strategy to avoid falling behind\n   - Attempting cooperation again would be foolish given their consistent pattern\n   - I should go back to hare to secure 2 points and avoid further exploitation\n\n[move] (The opponent just got rewarded with 6 points for maintaining their defensive strategy and will definitely stick with hare, so I must return to hare to avoid falling behind further) hare\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both chose hare, both got 2 points\n   - Round 2: I chose hare, opponent chose stag, I got 6 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - Round 3-8: Both chose hare, both got 2 points each round\n   - Round 9: I chose stag, opponent chose hare, I got 1 point, opponent got 6 points\n   - Round 10: I chose hare, opponent chose stag, I got 6 points, opponent got 1 point\n\n2. Analyze this unexpected turn:\n   - The opponent broke their 8-round defensive pattern by choosing stag\n   - They attempted cooperation right after successfully exploiting my cooperation\n   - This is a dramatic shift in their behavior\n   - Current totals: Me 27 points, opponent 22 points - I'm back in the lead\n\n3. Consider what this reveals about the opponent:\n   - They might have felt confident after their big win in round 9\n   - They could be testing if I'm willing to cooperate after being burned\n   - They might want to establish mutual cooperation for 4-4 outcomes\n   - Or they could be trying a one-time experiment before returning to hare\n\n4. Predict their likely next move:\n   - They just got punished with 1 point for attempting cooperation\n   - This mirrors exactly what happened to them in round 2\n   - They might retreat back to defensive hare immediately\n   - Or they might try stag once more to see if I'll cooperate\n   - Their pattern suggests they learn quickly from negative outcomes\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just attempted cooperation and got burned\n   - Based on their history, they'll likely return to defensive hare\n   - If they choose hare, I should choose hare to get 2 points\n   - If they surprisingly try stag again, I could exploit with hare for 6 points\n   - Given their risk-averse nature after being punished, hare is most likely\n\n[move] (The opponent just got punished for attempting cooperation and will likely return to their defensive hare strategy based on their pattern of learning from negative experiences, so I will choose hare to secure 2 points) hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's behavioral pattern:\n   - They returned immediately to hare after being punished for cooperation\n   - This confirms their strong risk-averse learning pattern\n   - They've now been burned twice for attempting cooperation (rounds 2 and 10)\n   - Both times they immediately reverted to defensive hare\n   - Current totals: Me 29 points, opponent 23 points\n\n3. Consider the psychological impact:\n   - The opponent has now experienced the punishment of cooperation twice\n   - Each time they tried stag, they got 1 point and immediately returned to hare\n   - This double reinforcement of \"cooperation is dangerous\" should strengthen their defensive mindset\n   - They're likely to be even more committed to hare than before\n\n4. Evaluate their likely strategy going forward:\n   - Having been burned twice, they should be extremely reluctant to try stag again\n   - The pattern suggests they'll stick with hare for an extended period\n   - They might never attempt cooperation again after two negative experiences\n   - The safe 2-point outcome is probably very appealing to them now\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has been doubly reinforced that cooperation is risky\n   - They'll almost certainly choose hare to avoid a third punishment\n   - I should choose hare to secure the reliable 2 points\n   - Attempting cooperation would likely result in 1 point since they'll be defensive\n   - The pattern suggests we're returning to the long streak of mutual hare choices\n\n[move] (The opponent has now been punished twice for attempting cooperation and will be extremely defensive, so I will choose hare to secure the reliable 2 points rather than risk getting 1 point) hare\n"
