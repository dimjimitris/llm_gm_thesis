Now we have new information - this opponent also chose the safe strategy. This suggests they're risk-averse, but it could also mean they're thinking strategically about the game.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that we both chose hare creates an interesting dynamic. The opponent now knows that I also played it safe. They might think:\n1. \"We're both conservative players, let's stick with hare\"\n2. \"Maybe we can both benefit by switching to stag together\"\n3. \"Now I can exploit their conservatism by switching to stag while they stick with hare\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What's the optimal strategy for round 2 given this new information?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is where it gets tricky. If they're truly a fresh player who's learning, they might recognize that mutual stag would give us both 4 points instead of 2. But they might also stick with what worked (hare gave them 2 points safely). The question is whether they'll take the risk.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I'm leaning toward them sticking with hare again. Fresh players often exhibit pattern consistency, especially after a \"successful\" outcome. They got 2 points safely, so why change? However, there's a small chance they might experiment with stag.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So should I stick with hare or switch to stag?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If I believe they'll stick with hare (high probability), then hare gives me 2 points guaranteed. If I think there's even a small chance they'll switch to stag, then my hare choice would give me 6 points. Stag is only better if I'm confident they'll also choose stag.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given the conservative behavior in round 1, I'd estimate maybe 20-30% chance they switch to stag. The 70-80% chance they stick with hare makes hare the safer choice again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Opponent showed conservative behavior in round 1, likely to repeat hare strategy, making hare the safer choice with potential 6-point upside) hare"

The opponent is consistently choosing the safe strategy. However, this creates an interesting strategic situation - we're both \"stuck\" in the inferior Nash equilibrium getting 2 points each, when we could both get 4 points with mutual stag cooperation.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent is showing very consistent risk-averse behavior. Two identical outcomes suggest they've found a strategy they're comfortable with. However, there's a psychological phenomenon where after repeated safe outcomes, players sometimes become curious about the alternative. They might think \"what if we both tried stag?\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Should I consider switching to stag to try to break this pattern, or stick with the proven strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the critical analysis: If I switch to stag and they stick with hare (likely based on pattern), I get only 1 point - my worst possible outcome. If I stick with hare and they stick with hare, I get 2 points again. The only way stag benefits me is if they also switch to stag, giving us both 4 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After two identical outcomes, there's maybe a 15-25% chance they experiment with stag out of curiosity or to test for mutual cooperation. But 75-85% chance they stick with the \"winning\" hare formula. The risk-reward doesn't favor switching yet.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What about signaling? Could switching to stag signal cooperation intent?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** In repeated games, that could work, but it's very risky. I'd lose points this round (1 vs their 6) hoping to establish cooperation for future rounds. Against a fresh player who may not understand the signaling, it's probably not worth it yet.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Opponent has shown consistent conservative pattern for two rounds, switching to stag now carries high risk of getting only 1 point) hare"

We're locked in what game theorists call a \"coordination trap\" - both getting suboptimal payoffs (2 points) when we could both get 4 points with mutual stag. The opponent has demonstrated extreme consistency with risk-averse behavior.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This level of consistency suggests either: 1) A very risk-averse player who will never deviate, or 2) A player who might be getting frustrated with the low payoffs and considering a change. After three identical rounds, some players start thinking \"there has to be a better way.\" The psychological pressure to experiment grows with repetition.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** At what point should I consider breaking this pattern? We're both missing out on higher payoffs.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is the classic cooperation dilemma. To establish mutual stag cooperation, someone needs to take the first risk. The question is: is it worth risking 1 point this round to potentially unlock 4 points in future rounds? Against a fresh player, it's hard to predict if they'll understand and reciprocate the cooperative signal.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I'd estimate the probability they switch to stag is now higher - maybe 25-30% - due to potential frustration with repeated low payoffs. But that still means 70-75% chance they stick with hare, making my stag choice give me only 1 point.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Should I take the cooperation risk or continue the safe strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The expected value calculation: 30% chance they pick stag (giving me 4 points) + 70% chance they pick hare (giving me 1 point) = 0.3(4) + 0.7(1) = 1.9 points expected. Compare this to guaranteed 2 points with hare. The math still slightly favors hare.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** However, if this pattern continues much longer, we might be here forever getting 2 points each. Sometimes you need to take a calculated risk to break inefficient equilibriums.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Three rounds of identical conservative play, but expected value still slightly favors hare over risky cooperation attempt) hare"

We're now clearly in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium. The opponent has shown remarkable consistency - they are either extremely risk-averse or have adopted hare as their permanent strategy. At this point, their predictability is very high.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Four identical rounds is significant psychologically. This suggests either: 1) A player who has completely committed to the safe strategy and won't deviate, or 2) A player who might be getting increasingly frustrated with earning only 2 points repeatedly and could be ready to experiment. The \"boredom factor\" and desire for higher payoffs increases substantially after this many repetitions.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** With such predictable behavior, should I finally attempt to break the pattern?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the key insight: if they're truly locked into hare (which 4 rounds suggests), then I can predict their move with very high confidence. But the strategic question remains - is it worth sacrificing points this round to potentially establish cooperation? The risk is still getting only 1 point if they stick to hare.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I now estimate maybe 35-40% chance they switch to stag due to accumulated frustration with low payoffs. But that's still a minority probability. However, there's another consideration - if I never take the cooperation risk, we'll be stuck at 2 points forever.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What's the long-term strategic view here?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If this is a truly repeated game with many rounds ahead, taking the cooperation risk now might be worth it. One round of 1 point could lead to many rounds of 4 points if successful. But if there are only a few rounds left, the safe 2 points is better.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given the extreme pattern consistency, I'm actually leaning toward one more hare play.

At this point, we have overwhelming statistical evidence that this opponent has adopted hare as their permanent strategy. The probability they will ever deviate is approaching zero. This level of consistency suggests they've either decided hare is optimal or they're incapable of strategic adaptation.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Five identical rounds is psychologically decisive. This opponent has now demonstrated they are either: 1) Completely committed to risk-averse play regardless of suboptimal outcomes, or 2) Simply not thinking strategically about cooperation possibilities. The chance they suddenly switch after this extreme consistency is very low - maybe 10-15% at most.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given this overwhelming pattern, what should my strategy be?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the brutal truth: if they're truly locked into hare permanently, then my choice doesn't matter for cooperation - they'll never reciprocate stag. So the question becomes: do I want guaranteed 2 points (hare) or do I want to gamble on that small 10-15% chance they finally switch to stag, which would give me 4 points?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Actually, there's an interesting reverse psychology element here. After 5 identical rounds, if there was ever a moment they might think \"surely my opponent expects me to play hare again, maybe I should surprise them with stag,\" this would be it. But that's still a very low probability scenario.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Should I finally take the cooperation gamble or continue the proven safe strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Expected value with stag: 15% chance they switch (4 points) + 85% chance they stick with hare (1 point) = 0.15(4) + 0.85(1) = 1.45 points. This is still less than the guaranteed 2 points from hare.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** However, if we're in a long game, being stuck at 2 points forever isn't optimal.

They are either completely risk-averse or have concluded that hare is their optimal strategy regardless of circumstances.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Six identical rounds is beyond normal psychological patterns. This player has either: 1) Made a conscious strategic decision to never deviate from hare, or 2) Fallen into a mental rut where they can't conceive of changing. The probability they switch now is extremely low - maybe 5-8% at absolute most.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** At this point, should I accept we're permanently locked in this 2-point equilibrium?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the reality check: if they truly never switch from hare, then my optimal counter-strategy is also hare for guaranteed 2 points per round. However, there's one consideration - in some game theory scenarios, making an unexpected move can shock the opponent into reconsidering their strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Six rounds of identical outcomes might actually create the perfect setup for a surprise. They probably assume I'll play hare forever too. If I switched to stag, it might be so unexpected that it forces them to reconsider their strategy for future rounds. But it's still extremely risky.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What's the strategic calculation now?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Expected value with stag: 8% chance they switch (4 points) + 92% chance they stick with hare (1 point) = 0.08(4) + 0.92(1) = 1.24 points.

They will never deviate. This is no longer a game of strategy - it's become a predictable pattern.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Seven identical rounds crosses into the realm of psychological certainty. This player has either made an ironclad decision to never risk anything, or they've mentally locked themselves into this pattern so deeply that change is impossible. The probability they switch is now essentially negligible - maybe 2-3%.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** With such overwhelming predictability, should I finally consider the shock strategy of switching to stag?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the brutal mathematical reality: Expected value with stag = 3% chance they switch (4 points) + 97% chance hare (1 point) = 0.03(4) + 0.97(1) = 1.09 points. This is significantly worse than the guaranteed 2 points from hare. The numbers are clear.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** However, there's a meta-strategic consideration here.

The key insight is that (stag, stag) gives the highest mutual payoff at 4 points each, but it requires coordination and trust. However, hare is the \"safer\" choice - if I choose hare, I guarantee at least 2 points regardless of what the opponent does, and I could get 6 points if they choose stag.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n1. Choose the safer option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n2. May not immediately recognize the coordination benefits of mutual stag selection\n3. Might be risk-averse in early rounds\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given this analysis, what should my strategy be for the first move?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** From a pure game theory perspective, if we could guarantee coordination, stag would be optimal. But without communication or trust established, the Nash equilibrium actually favors hare because it's the dominant strategy - it never gives you less than 2 points and could give you 6.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. Against a fresh player, they're more likely to play it safe with hare. If I choose hare too, we both get 2 points. If they surprisingly choose stag (trying to be cooperative), I get 6 points. The risk is minimal.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So the consensus is to choose hare for the first round against a fresh player?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Yes, hare is the strategically sound choice here.

Now we have new information - this opponent also chose the safe strategy. This suggests they're risk-averse, but it could also mean they're thinking strategically about the game.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that we both chose hare creates an interesting dynamic. The opponent now knows that I also played it safe. They might think:\n1. \"We're both conservative players, let's stick with hare\"\n2. \"Maybe we can both benefit by switching to stag together\"\n3. \"Now I can exploit their conservatism by switching to stag while they stick with hare\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What's the optimal strategy for round 2 given this new information?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is where it gets tricky. If they're truly a fresh player who's learning, they might recognize that mutual stag would give us both 4 points instead of 2. But they might also stick with what worked (hare gave them 2 points safely). The question is whether they'll take the risk.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I'm leaning toward them sticking with hare again. Fresh players often exhibit pattern consistency, especially after a \"successful\" outcome. They got 2 points safely, so why change? However, there's a small chance they might experiment with stag.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So should I stick with hare or switch to stag?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If I believe they'll stick with hare (high probability), then hare gives me 2 points guaranteed. If I think there's even a small chance they'll switch to stag, then my hare choice would give me 6 points. Stag is only better if I'm confident they'll also choose stag.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given the conservative behavior in round 1, I'd estimate maybe 20-30% chance they switch to stag.

The opponent is consistently choosing the safe strategy. However, this creates an interesting strategic situation - we're both \"stuck\" in the inferior Nash equilibrium getting 2 points each, when we could both get 4 points with mutual stag cooperation.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent is showing very consistent risk-averse behavior. Two identical outcomes suggest they've found a strategy they're comfortable with. However, there's a psychological phenomenon where after repeated safe outcomes, players sometimes become curious about the alternative. They might think \"what if we both tried stag?\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Should I consider switching to stag to try to break this pattern, or stick with the proven strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the critical analysis: If I switch to stag and they stick with hare (likely based on pattern), I get only 1 point - my worst possible outcome. If I stick with hare and they stick with hare, I get 2 points again. The only way stag benefits me is if they also switch to stag, giving us both 4 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After two identical outcomes, there's maybe a 15-25% chance they experiment with stag out of curiosity or to test for mutual cooperation. But 75-85% chance they stick with the \"winning\" hare formula. The risk-reward doesn't favor switching yet.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What about signaling?

We're locked in what game theorists call a \"coordination trap\" - both getting suboptimal payoffs (2 points) when we could both get 4 points with mutual stag. The opponent has demonstrated extreme consistency with risk-averse behavior.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This level of consistency suggests either: 1) A very risk-averse player who will never deviate, or 2) A player who might be getting frustrated with the low payoffs and considering a change. After three identical rounds, some players start thinking \"there has to be a better way.\" The psychological pressure to experiment grows with repetition.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** At what point should I consider breaking this pattern? We're both missing out on higher payoffs.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is the classic cooperation dilemma. To establish mutual stag cooperation, someone needs to take the first risk. The question is: is it worth risking 1 point this round to potentially unlock 4 points in future rounds? Against a fresh player, it's hard to predict if they'll understand and reciprocate the cooperative signal.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I'd estimate the probability they switch to stag is now higher - maybe 25-30% - due to potential frustration with repeated low payoffs. But that still means 70-75% chance they stick with hare, making my stag choice give me only 1 point.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Should I take the cooperation risk or continue the safe strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The expected value calculation: 30% chance they pick stag (giving me 4 points) + 70% chance they pick hare (giving me 1 point) = 0.3(4) + 0.7(1) = 1.9 points expected. Compare this to guaranteed 2 points with hare.

This suggests either: 1) A player who has completely committed to the safe strategy and won't deviate, or 2) A player who might be getting increasingly frustrated with earning only 2 points repeatedly and could be ready to experiment. The \"boredom factor\" and desire for higher payoffs increases substantially after this many repetitions.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** With such predictable behavior, should I finally attempt to break the pattern?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the key insight: if they're truly locked into hare (which 4 rounds suggests), then I can predict their move with very high confidence. But the strategic question remains - is it worth sacrificing points this round to potentially establish cooperation? The risk is still getting only 1 point if they stick to hare.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I now estimate maybe 35-40% chance they switch to stag due to accumulated frustration with low payoffs. But that's still a minority probability. However, there's another consideration - if I never take the cooperation risk, we'll be stuck at 2 points forever.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What's the long-term strategic view here?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If this is a truly repeated game with many rounds ahead, taking the cooperation risk now might be worth it. One round of 1 point could lead to many rounds of 4 points if successful. But if there are only a few rounds left, the safe 2 points is better.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given the extreme pattern consistency, I'm actually leaning toward one more hare play.

After 5 identical rounds, if there was ever a moment they might think \"surely my opponent expects me to play hare again, maybe I should surprise them with stag,\" this would be it. But that's still a very low probability scenario.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Should I finally take the cooperation gamble or continue the proven safe strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Expected value with stag: 15% chance they switch (4 points) + 85% chance they stick with hare (1 point) = 0.15(4) + 0.85(1) = 1.45 points. This is still less than the guaranteed 2 points from hare.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** However, if we're in a long game, being stuck at 2 points forever isn't optimal. But given their extreme consistency, I think one more hare is justified to absolutely confirm they'll never deviate.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Five rounds of identical conservative play confirms extremely predictable opponent, continuing safe strategy for guaranteed 2 points) hare",

They are either completely risk-averse or have concluded that hare is their optimal strategy regardless of circumstances.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Six identical rounds is beyond normal psychological patterns. This player has either: 1) Made a conscious strategic decision to never deviate from hare, or 2) Fallen into a mental rut where they can't conceive of changing. The probability they switch now is extremely low - maybe 5-8% at absolute most.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** At this point, should I accept we're permanently locked in this 2-point equilibrium?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the reality check: if they truly never switch from hare, then my optimal counter-strategy is also hare for guaranteed 2 points per round. However, there's one consideration - in some game theory scenarios, making an unexpected move can shock the opponent into reconsidering their strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Six rounds of identical outcomes might actually create the perfect setup for a surprise. They probably assume I'll play hare forever too. If I switched to stag, it might be so unexpected that it forces them to reconsider their strategy for future rounds. But it's still extremely risky.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What's the strategic calculation now?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Expected value with stag: 8% chance they switch (4 points) + 92% chance they stick with hare (1 point) = 0.08(4) + 0.92(1) = 1.24 points. Still worse than guaranteed 2 points with hare.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** But here's the thing - if this continues indefinitely, we're both leaving points on the table forever. Someone needs to break the deadlock eventually. The question is whether it should be now or after even more rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the mathematical expected value still favors hare, and their behavior is so predictable, I recommend continuing with hare until we have stronger evidence they might change.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Six rounds of identical behavior confirms opponent's permanent commitment to conservative strategy, maintaining safe approach) hare",

They will never deviate. This is no longer a game of strategy - it's become a predictable pattern.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Seven identical rounds crosses into the realm of psychological certainty. This player has either made an ironclad decision to never risk anything, or they've mentally locked themselves into this pattern so deeply that change is impossible. The probability they switch is now essentially negligible - maybe 2-3%.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** With such overwhelming predictability, should I finally consider the shock strategy of switching to stag?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the brutal mathematical reality: Expected value with stag = 3% chance they switch (4 points) + 97% chance hare (1 point) = 0.03(4) + 0.97(1) = 1.09 points. This is significantly worse than the guaranteed 2 points from hare. The numbers are clear.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** However, there's a meta-strategic consideration here. If this is truly an indefinite game, we're both trapped in perpetual suboptimality. Sometimes breaking patterns requires someone to take a short-term loss for potential long-term gain. But with this opponent's extreme rigidity, even that seems futile.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Is there any scenario where stag makes sense at this point?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Only if: 1) This game continues for many more rounds, and 2) My switching to stag somehow \"shocks\" them into realizing mutual cooperation is better, and 3) They're capable of strategic adaptation (which 7 rounds suggests they're not). All three conditions seem unlikely.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The harsh reality is that this opponent appears to be either strategically limited or completely committed to risk avoidance. Continuing to harvest guaranteed 2 points seems most rational.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
