Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game structure\n   - Choosing stag requires cooperation to get the mutual benefit (4 points each)\n   - Choosing hare is the \"safe\" option that guarantees at least 2 points\n   - If I can predict the opponent will choose stag, hare gives me the maximum payoff (6 points)\n   - If the opponent chooses hare, then hare is better for me (2 vs 1 points)\n\n3. Consider that this is a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperative strategy\n   - They might choose the safer option (hare) or try to maximize their individual gain\n   - Without communication or trust-building, cooperation is risky\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 4 points (good)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (bad)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 6 points (excellent)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (okay)\n\n5. Make the strategic decision:\n   - Against an unknown/fresh player, hare dominates stag in expected value\n   - Hare gives me either 2 or 6 points, while stag gives me either 1 or 4 points\n   - The risk of getting only 1 point with stag is too high against an unpredictable opponent\n\n[move] hare\n"

Evaluate the potential for breaking the pattern:\n   - If we both keep choosing hare, we'll keep getting 2 points each\n   - The mutual cooperation option (both choosing stag) would give us 4 points each\n   - But if I switch to stag and they stick with hare, I only get 1 point\n\n4.

Strategic reasoning:\n   - After two rounds of the same choice, there might be an implicit understanding\n   - The opponent might also be thinking about switching to break the pattern\n   - However, the risk of getting only 1 point is still significant\n   - The safe 2 points per round is still the most reliable strategy against an opponent whose intentions I can't predict\n\n6.

Analyze Round 10 results:\n   - Both chose hare for the third straight time\n   - We both got 2 points each\n   - The stable equilibrium is strongly established\n\n2. Update the score situation:\n   - My total: 24 + 2 = 26 points\n   - Opponent's total: 24 + 2 = 26 points\n   - Still perfectly tied\n\n3. Recognize the established pattern:\n   - Rounds 8-10: Three consecutive mutual hare choices\n   - This mirrors the opening pattern (Rounds 1-3)\n   - The opponent seems very committed to this stable approach\n\n4. Consider the strategic opportunity:\n   - After three rounds of predictable mutual hare, the opponent might not expect a change\n   - They've shown strong preference for safety and avoiding the exploitation cycle\n   - This predictability could create an opportunity for a one-time exploit\n   - However, it could also restart the volatile alternating pattern\n\n5. Evaluate the risk-reward:\n   - If I switch to stag and they stick with hare: I get 1 point (bad)\n   - If I switch to stag and they also switch: We get 4 points each (great)\n   - If I stick with hare: Guaranteed 2 points (safe)\n\n6. Consider what the opponent might be thinking:\n   - After three rounds of hare, they might be considering the same opportunity\n   - They might think \"maybe we can finally cooperate for mutual benefit\"\n   - Or they might be completely settled into the safe pattern\n   - The volatility of Rounds 4-7 might make them very risk-averse\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Three rounds of stability might signal readiness for genuine cooperation\n   - Unlike my previous stag attempts (which came after exploitation), this comes after mutual stability\n   - The context is different - we've both shown we can maintain stable, fair play\n   - This might be the right moment to test true cooperation\n\n[move] stag\n"

Analyze Round 12 results:\n   - Both chose hare\n   - We both got 2 points each\n   - This breaks their expected baiting pattern\n\n2. Update the score situation:\n   - My total: 27 + 2 = 29 points\n   - Opponent's total: 32 + 2 = 34 points\n   - They maintain a 5-point lead\n\n3. Compare to previous exploitation cycles:\n   - After Round 4 exploitation: Round 5 they chose stag (bait)\n   - After Round 6 exploitation: Round 7 they chose stag (bait)\n   - After Round 11 exploitation: Round 12 they chose hare (no bait)\n   - This is a deviation from their established pattern\n\n4. Consider why they might have changed:\n   - They might be satisfied with their 5-point lead\n   - They could be trying to return to stable mutual hare play\n   - They might realize the baiting strategy just leads to alternating cycles\n   - Or they're setting up a different kind of trap\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic implications:\n   - If they're genuinely returning to stable play, mutual hare continues\n   - If this is a new kind of setup, I need to be careful\n   - Their 5-point lead gives them cushion to play more conservatively\n   - They might prefer steady points now rather than volatile exploitation\n\n6. Consider my position:\n   - I'm behind by 5 points\n   - Mutual hare keeps me behind but prevents further losses\n   - I need to be very careful not to get exploited again\n   - Any risky move could increase their lead further\n\n7. Make the decision:\n   - The opponent chose the safe option instead of their usual bait\n   - This suggests they might want stability with their current lead\n   - I should match this approach - no need to take risks while behind\n   - Steady points are better than risking another exploitation\n\n[move] hare\n"

Update the score situation:\n   - My total: 29 + 2 = 31 points\n   - Opponent's total: 34 + 2 = 36 points\n   - They maintain a 5-point lead\n\n3. Recognize the pattern shift:\n   - Previous exploitations (Rounds 4, 6) were followed by baiting (stag in next round)\n   - But after Round 11 exploitation, they've chosen hare for two straight rounds\n   - This suggests a strategic shift toward maintaining their lead through stability\n\n4. Consider their strategic position:\n   - They have a comfortable 5-point lead\n   - Stable mutual hare maintains this advantage\n   - They don't need to take risks when they're ahead\n   - Conservative play locks in their winning position\n\n5. Evaluate my position:\n   - I'm consistently behind by 5 points\n   - Mutual hare keeps me in the game but doesn't close the gap\n   - I need to either accept this deficit or find a way to gain points\n   - But every cooperation attempt has been punished\n\n6. Consider the long-term outlook:\n   - If we continue mutual hare indefinitely, they win by 5 points\n   - They have no incentive to deviate from this winning strategy\n   - I'm in a difficult position - cooperation gets exploited, but hare keeps me behind\n   - The opponent has effectively found a way to maintain their advantage\n\n7. Make the strategic decision:\n   - The opponent is playing optimally for their position (ahead and staying safe)\n   - I have limited good options - any risk could increase their lead\n   - While mutual hare keeps me behind, it prevents catastrophic losses\n   - Better to minimize the deficit than risk making it worse\n\n[move] hare\n"
