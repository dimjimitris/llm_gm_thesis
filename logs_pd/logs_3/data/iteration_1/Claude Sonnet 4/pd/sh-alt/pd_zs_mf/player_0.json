You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This tells me the other player was also thinking defensively, avoiding the risk of getting only 1 point.\n\nNow I have some information about this opponent's approach. They seem to be risk-averse like I was. However, now that we've both demonstrated we're cautious players, there might be an opportunity to coordinate on the better mutual outcome.\n\nThe question is whether they'll stick with the \"safe\" hare strategy, or if they might be thinking the same thing I am - that we could both benefit from choosing stag this time for 4 points each instead of 2.\n\nThis is a classic coordination problem. If I think they're likely to evolve their strategy toward cooperation, stag becomes more attractive. But if they're very conservative and will stick with hare, I should probably stick with hare too to get 2 points rather than risk getting only 1.\n\n[move] (The other player showed caution in round 1, but now that we've both demonstrated we're thoughtful players, they might be willing to coordinate on the mutually beneficial outcome) stag\n"

Continue matching with hare for a guaranteed 2 points\n2. Try stag again, hoping they might finally coordinate, but risk another 1 point\n\nSince they've shown no willingness to deviate from hare even after seeing I was willing to cooperate, they seem locked into this strategy. The rational response is to match their strategy and secure the consistent 2 points rather than keep risking 1-point outcomes.\n\n[move] (My opponent has consistently chosen hare across three rounds, showing they're committed to avoiding the 1-point risk.

Keep matching with hare for the steady 2 points per round\n2. Occasionally try stag to test if they ever change their strategy\n\nGiven their consistency over four rounds, including after they saw me try to cooperate once, it seems unlikely they'll switch. The smart play is to continue matching their strategy rather than throwing away points on failed cooperation attempts.\n\n[move] (My opponent has now chosen hare in four consecutive rounds, demonstrating a firm commitment to this safe strategy.
