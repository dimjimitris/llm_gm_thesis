It prevents the opponent from exploiting me for easy points while guaranteeing a steady 2 points per round.\n\nGiven their proven track record of exploitation, any attempt to break this cycle with cooperation would almost certainly result in them defecting again for 4 points while I get 1 point.\n\n[move] (Opponent's perfect record of exploiting cooperation makes defection the only rational choice) defection\n"
