Consider the strategic implications:\n   - The opponent showed they can both exploit and cooperate\n   - Their switch to cooperation after my defection suggests they want to move toward mutual cooperation\n   - This could be an opportunity to establish a beneficial pattern\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: We both get 6 (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1, they get 4 (I get exploited again)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4, they get 1 (I exploit them)\n   - If I defect and they defect: We both get 2 (mutual punishment)\n\n5. Consider the long-term strategy:\n   - Testing cooperation now could establish mutual trust and lead to consistent 6-point rounds\n   - The opponent's cooperative move suggests they're open to this\n   - The risk is being exploited again, but the potential reward is high\n\nFinal decision: I'll test cooperation to see if we can establish a mutually beneficial pattern.\n\n[move] (Since you cooperated after I defected, I'll test if we can establish mutual cooperation) cooperation\n"

Identify the opponent's clear strategy pattern:\n   - They defect whenever I cooperate\n   - They cooperate whenever I defect\n   - This is a classic \"opposite\" or \"contrarian\" strategy\n   - They are consistently exploiting my cooperative moves\n\n3. Understand the strategic situation:\n   - The opponent has figured out a way to consistently get either 4 points (when I cooperate) or 1 point (when I defect)\n   - When I cooperate, I always get 1 point and they get 4\n   - When I defect, I always get 4 points and they get 1\n   - They're currently ahead by 3 points due to this pattern\n\n4.

Plan the best strategy:\n   - Since they will cooperate whenever I defect, I should defect consistently\n   - This guarantees me 4 points per round going forward\n   - This also limits them to only 1 point per round\n\nFinal decision: I'll defect consistently since their strategy is predictably contrarian.\n\n[move] (You consistently defect when I cooperate, so I'll defect to maximize my score) defection\n"

Analyze my strategic options:\n   - If I defect again: Risk of continued mutual defection (2 points each)\n   - If I cooperate: Risk being exploited again (1 point vs their 4), but might reset to better outcomes\n   - Need to consider what breaks us out of low-scoring patterns\n\n5.
