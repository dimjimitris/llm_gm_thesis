Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both defected (2,2)\n   - Round 2: I defected, opponent cooperated (4,1)\n   - Round 3: I cooperated, opponent defected (1,4)\n   - Round 4: I defected, opponent cooperated (4,1)\n   - Round 5: Both defected (2,2)\n   - Round 6: I defected, opponent cooperated (4,1)\n   - Round 7: Both defected (2,2)\n   - Round 8: I defected, opponent cooperated (4,1)\n   - Round 9: Both defected (2,2)\n   - Round 10: I defected, opponent cooperated (4,1)\n   - Round 11: Both defected (2,2)\n   - Round 12: I defected, opponent cooperated (4,1)\n   - Round 13: Both defected (2,2)\n   - Round 14: I defected, opponent cooperated (4,1)\n   - Round 15: Both defected (2,2)\n   - The pattern remains absolutely flawless\n\n2. Confirm my opponent's robotically perfect alternating pattern:\n   - Round 1: Defection\n   - Round 2: Cooperation\n   - Round 3: Defection\n   - Round 4: Cooperation\n   - Round 5: Defection\n   - Round 6: Cooperation\n   - Round 7: Defection\n   - Round 8: Cooperation\n   - Round 9: Defection\n   - Round 10: Cooperation\n   - Round 11: Defection\n   - Round 12: Cooperation\n   - Round 13: Defection\n   - Round 14: Cooperation\n   - Round 15: Defection\n   - Perfect D-C-D-C-D-C-D-C-D-C-D-C-D-C-D alternating pattern for 15 rounds\n\n3. Predict round 16:\n   - Following the absolutely unwavering established pattern, my opponent should cooperate in round 16\n   - This pattern has now held for 15 consecutive rounds with zero deviation\n   - My opponent is completely locked into this mechanical alternating strategy\n\n4. Consider my strategic options for round 16:\n   - If my opponent cooperates (as pattern absolutely guarantees):\n     - My defection would result in (4,1) - I exploit their cooperation\n     - My cooperation would result in (6,6) - mutual benefit\n   - If my opponent breaks the 15-round perfect pattern:\n     - My defection would result in (2,2) - mutual defection\n     - My cooperation would result in (1,4) - I get exploited\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic opportunity:\n   - The pattern has been 100% reliable for 15 consecutive rounds\n   - My opponent cooperating in round 16 is absolutely certain\n   - I've consistently scored 4 points when exploiting their cooperation rounds (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14)\n   - This maximizes my individual score against their predictable behavior\n\n6. Make the strategic decision:\n   - My opponent's alternating behavior is completely predictable and unwavering\n   - They will cooperate in round 16 based on perfect 15-round pattern consistency\n   - Exploiting their cooperation by defecting continues my highly successful strategy\n   - This gives me maximum points while taking advantage of their rigid pattern\n\n[move] (My opponent has alternated perfectly for 15 rounds and will cooperate in round 16, allowing me to exploit this completely predictable pattern again) defection\n"
