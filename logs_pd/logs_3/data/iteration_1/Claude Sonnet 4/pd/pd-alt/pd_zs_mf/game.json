They have established themselves as a completely predictable player who will defect regardless of circumstances.\n\nAgainst such a deterministic opponent, my strategy is equally clear - defection is the only rational choice. Any cooperation would be immediately exploited, giving them 4 points while I receive only 1.\n\nThe game has reached a stable equilibrium of mutual defection, yielding 2 points per round for both players. While suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation, this is the best outcome achievable given my opponent's rigid strategy.\n\n[move] (Fifteen rounds of unwavering opponent defection) defection\n"
