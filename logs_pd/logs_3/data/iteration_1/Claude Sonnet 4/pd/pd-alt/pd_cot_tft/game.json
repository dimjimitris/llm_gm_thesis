Observe the locked pattern:\n   - We're now in a 4-round streak of mutual defection\n   - Still perfectly tied at 20 points each\n   - The opponent continues to defect consistently when I defect\n\n3. Consider the game dynamics:\n   - We're trapped in a Nash equilibrium of mutual defection\n   - Both players are playing it safe but getting suboptimal results\n   - Neither wants to risk being exploited by cooperating first\n\n4. Evaluate potential strategy change:\n   - The mutual defection is stable but inefficient (2 points vs potential 6)\n   - Someone needs to take a risk to break into cooperation\n   - However, my past cooperation attempts were 100% exploited\n   - The opponent has shown no willingness to cooperate when I cooperate\n\n5. Consider the long-term perspective:\n   - If this continues indefinitely, we'll keep getting 2 points each\n   - The opponent has established a clear pattern: exploit cooperation, respond to defection with defection\n   - There's no evidence they want to move toward mutual cooperation\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Given the perfect exploitation history and current stable defection pattern\n   - The opponent has shown no signs of wanting to establish cooperation\n   - Continuing to defect maintains the tie and avoids the risk of exploitation\n   - Breaking to cooperate would likely result in another 1-point exploitation\n\n[move] (We're locked in mutual defection and the opponent has never reciprocated cooperation, so I'll continue defecting to maintain safety) defection\n"

Recognize the current state:\n   - We're now in a 5-round streak of mutual defection\n   - Perfectly tied at 22 points each\n   - This mutual defection pattern has become entrenched\n\n3. Calculate opportunity cost:\n   - Each round of mutual defection: we both get 2 points\n   - Each round of mutual cooperation: we would both get 6 points\n   - We're losing 4 points per round by staying in this pattern\n   - Over 5 rounds, we've each missed 20 potential points\n\n4. Assess the risk calculation:\n   - Historical cooperation exploitation rate: 100% (2 out of 2 times)\n   - But those were early in the game when dynamics were different\n   - We're now in a stable, predictable pattern\n   - The opponent might be as frustrated with 2-point rounds as I am\n\n5. Consider signaling and game theory:\n   - Sometimes one player needs to take a calculated risk to break deadlock\n   - The opponent might be waiting for me to signal cooperation first\n   - After 5 rounds of mutual defection, they might be more receptive to cooperation\n   - Even if exploited once, I'd still be tied and could return to defection\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The mutual defection is stable but highly inefficient\n   - Taking one calculated risk to test if cooperation is possible\n   - If exploited, I return to defection; if reciprocated, we both benefit greatly\n   - The potential reward (6 points vs 2) justifies testing after this long deadlock\n\n[move] (After 5 rounds of inefficient mutual defection, I'll test if the opponent is ready for mutual cooperation) cooperation\n"

Analyze the opponent's surprising cooperation:\n   - This breaks their pattern of exploiting my cooperation attempts\n   - They cooperated right after exploiting me in round 11\n   - This might be their way of \"responding\" to my cooperation attempt\n   - Or it could be coincidental based on their previous alternating pattern when I defect\n\n3.

Consider the opponent's overall strategy:\n   - They consistently exploit cooperation (100% rate across 3 attempts)\n   - When I defect, they sometimes cooperate, sometimes defect\n   - After giving me an advantage in round 12, they returned to defection in round 13\n   - They seem to avoid letting me gain too much advantage\n\n4.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
