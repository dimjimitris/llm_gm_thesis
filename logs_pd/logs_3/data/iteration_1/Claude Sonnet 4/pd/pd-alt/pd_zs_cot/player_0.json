You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

However, now that we've both experienced the suboptimal outcome of mutual defection (2 points each vs. potential 6 points each), they might be more inclined to try cooperation.\n\nThis creates an interesting decision point. If I cooperate and they continue to defect, I get the worst outcome (1 point). But if we both cooperate, we both get the best mutual outcome (6 points each).\n\nGiven that this is only the second round and there's potential for building toward mutual cooperation, I'll take a calculated risk.\n\n[move] (Since we both defected last round and got a suboptimal outcome, I'll try cooperation to see if we can achieve the better mutual benefit of 6 points each) cooperation\n"

Now in round 3, they cooperated, possibly in response to my cooperation from round 2.\n\nThis suggests they might be trying to establish mutual cooperation but with a delay in their responses. If this pattern continues, they might cooperate again in round 4.\n\nI have two main options:\n1. Defect again to get another 4 points if they cooperate\n2. Cooperate to potentially establish mutual cooperation (6 points each going forward)\n\nGiven that mutual cooperation yields the best long-term outcome and my opponent seems to be signaling willingness to cooperate, I should test whether we can establish this beneficial pattern.\n\n[move] (My opponent just cooperated, possibly signaling a desire for mutual cooperation after our previous rounds of mixed strategies.

Instead, my opponent seems to be following a pattern where they defect when I cooperate and cooperate when I defect. This could be:\n1. An alternating strategy designed to maximize their advantage\n2. A contrarian approach - doing the opposite of what I did\n3. A strategy to exploit any cooperation attempts\n\nThe pattern suggests that if I cooperate, they will likely defect (getting them 4 points, me 1 point).
