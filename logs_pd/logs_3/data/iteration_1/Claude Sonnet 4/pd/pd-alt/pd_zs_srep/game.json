We're back to mutual defection at 2 points each.\n\nThis suggests they tested whether I would reciprocate their cooperative gesture, and when I didn't, they returned to defection. This could indicate:\n1. They're frustrated with the mutual defection deadlock\n2. They wanted to see if I'd be willing to restart cooperation\n3. They're back to their defensive posture after I didn't reciprocate\n\nThe situation is complex. We're both losing out significantly - getting only 2 points per round instead of the 6 we could get from mutual cooperation. However, their history of exploitation (three times they've defected when I cooperated) makes it very risky for me to trust them.\n\nTheir recent cooperation attempt followed by return to defection when I didn't reciprocate might suggest they're also stuck in this defensive mindset due to the conflict cycle we've created.\n\nBut given their proven track record of exploitation, I cannot risk being vulnerable. They need to demonstrate sustained trustworthy behavior before I can consider cooperation.\n\n[move] (Maintaining defection as their history of exploitation makes cooperation too risky) defection\n"
