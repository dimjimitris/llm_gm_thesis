Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Predicting opponent behavior for this round:\n   - The opponent has now experienced both outcomes of cooperation (1 point) and defection (2 points)\n   - They likely understand that defection is safer than cooperation\n   - They may continue defecting to avoid the 1-point outcome\n   - However, they might also recognize that mutual cooperation (6 points each) is better than mutual defection (2 points each)\n\n3.

Considering a strategy change:\n   - If I cooperate and opponent defects: I get 1 point (risky)\n   - If I cooperate and opponent also cooperates: We both get 6 points (optimal)\n   - The question is whether the opponent might also be considering breaking the cycle\n\n4.

Analyzing the complete pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: I defected, opponent cooperated - I got 4 points\n   - Round 2: Both defected - I got 2 points\n   - Round 3: Both defected - I got 2 points\n   - Round 4: I cooperated, opponent defected - I got 1 point\n   - Round 5: I defected, opponent cooperated - I got 4 points\n   - Round 6: I cooperated, opponent defected - I got 1 point\n   - Round 7: Both defected - I got 2 points\n   - Round 8: Both defected - I got 2 points\n   - Round 9: Both defected - I got 2 points (just happened)\n\n2. Evaluating the extended stalemate:\n   - We've now had three consecutive rounds of mutual defection\n   - The opponent's previous pattern of alternating cooperation/defection has stopped\n   - They seem to have settled into consistent defection like me\n   - This suggests they may have also learned that cooperation leads to exploitation\n\n3. Considering current strategic dynamics:\n   - Both players appear to have reached the same conclusion about the futility of cooperation\n   - We're both protecting ourselves from exploitation\n   - The 2-point mutual defection outcome has become the stable equilibrium\n   - Neither player is willing to risk the 1-point exploitation outcome\n\n4. Long-term outlook assessment:\n   - If this pattern continues, we'll both keep getting 2 points indefinitely\n   - This is the classic prisoner's dilemma Nash equilibrium\n   - Breaking out would require genuine trust, which has been broken multiple times\n   - The opponent has demonstrated they will exploit cooperative gestures\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - The mutual defection equilibrium is stable and predictable\n   - Attempting cooperation has repeatedly resulted in exploitation\n   - The opponent has shown no signs of genuine willingness to sustain cooperation\n   - Maintaining defection is the rational response given the established history\n\n[move] (Continuing defection as the stable equilibrium has been established and cooperation attempts have consistently been exploited) defection\n"

Evaluating the current strategic situation:\n   - The mutual defection Nash equilibrium is firmly established\n   - Both players are avoiding the risk of exploitation\n   - The opponent has demonstrated they will not sustain genuine cooperation\n   - Any cooperation attempt would likely restart the exploitation cycle\n\n4.
