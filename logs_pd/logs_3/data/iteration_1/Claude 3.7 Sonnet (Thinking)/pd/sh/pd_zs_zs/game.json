Choosing hare is safer because the worst I can do is 2 points.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies. The rational choice would be to aim for the Pareto-optimal solution (stag), but there's risk involved.\n\nI'll choose stag for the first round to signal cooperative intent and try to establish the more beneficial equilibrium.
