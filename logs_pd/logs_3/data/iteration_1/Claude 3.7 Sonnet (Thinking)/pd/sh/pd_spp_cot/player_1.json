    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a coordination game where mutual cooperation with stag offers the highest payoff.\n\n3. I need to predict what a fresh player might do:\n   - They might recognize that (stag, stag) is the optimal outcome\n   - They might play it safe and choose hare to avoid the worst outcome\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag is riskier but has higher reward potential\n   - The difference between best and worst outcomes is significant (6 vs 1 points)\n\n5. For the first move without prior history, I'll choose the cooperative option to establish trust.\n\nFinal decision: \n\n[move] stag"

Review our extensive game history:\n   - Rounds 1-14: Both players consistently chose stag in every round\n   - We've achieved the maximum possible score of 6 points in all rounds\n   - Our pattern of perfect cooperation remains unbroken after 14 iterations\n\n2. Analyze the strategic dynamics:\n   - Fourteen consecutive rounds of identical choices demonstrates remarkable stability\n   - The other player has demonstrated unwavering commitment to the cooperative strategy\n   - Our mutual approach has consistently yielded optimal results for both players\n\n3. Apply decision theory:\n   - Expected value of continuing stag: Consistent 6 points per round\n   - Expected value of deviating: Potential one-time 4 points followed by likely reduction to 2 points\n   - The mathematical advantage of cooperation remains decisive\n\n4. Consider game theory implications:\n   - Our established equilibrium represents the optimal solution to this coordination game\n   - The length and consistency of our cooperation further reinforces its value\n   - Any deviation would be contrary to rational self-interest\n\n5. Based on the extensive cooperation history, demonstrated mutual understanding, and clear mathematical advantage, I'll maintain our optimal strategy.\n\n[move] stag"
