    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me collaborate with some expert personas to formulate the best strategy.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist; Psychologist; Strategic Planner\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game with two Nash equilibria - both players choosing stag or both choosing hare. The stag-stag outcome (6,6) is Pareto optimal, providing the highest payoff for both players. However, choosing stag is risky if you think the other player might choose hare.\n\nPsychologist: In the first round against a fresh player, there's no prior history to analyze. Many players default to cooperation (stag) initially to establish mutual trust. However, some may choose hare as a safer option since it guarantees at least 2 points instead of potentially getting only 1 point.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is likely a multi-round game, starting with stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. If the other player also chooses stag, we establish a beneficial pattern. If they choose hare, we can adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Risk assessment is important here. Choosing stag has a higher potential reward (6 points) but also a higher risk (potentially only 1 point). Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points with potential for 4 points.\n\nStrategic Planner: In the first round against an unknown player, I recommend choosing stag to establish a cooperative tone and aim for the optimal outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate for mutual benefit in our first interaction."

This suggests the opponent is cooperative and recognizes the mutual benefit of coordination.\n\nPsychologist: This is a positive sign. The opponent has demonstrated willingness to cooperate. In repeated games, continuing with the established successful pattern tends to reinforce the cooperative behavior.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we've established mutual trust in round 1, the rational move is to continue choosing stag. Deviating to hare would potentially disrupt the cooperative equilibrium and could trigger a retaliation in future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent has demonstrated risk tolerance by choosing stag initially. This increases the probability they will continue choosing stag as long as we maintain cooperation. The stag-stag equilibrium (6,6) is strictly better than the hare-hare equilibrium (2,2), so maintaining this pattern is optimal.\n\nPsychologist: Consistent behavior builds trust. Switching to hare now would signal opportunism and potentially damage future cooperation. The optimal strategy psychologically is to continue the established cooperative pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend maintaining the stag choice to continue building on the cooperative relationship established in round 1.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Continuing cooperation based on our successful first round."

Breaking this pattern now would be counterproductive, as it would likely damage the trust built so far.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our total score is 12 points after two rounds, which is the maximum possible. The opponent appears to be a rational player who recognizes the advantage of cooperation. Continuing with stag is the optimal strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: One consideration is whether the opponent might try to exploit our cooperative behavior by switching to hare. However, this would be a short-sighted strategy on their part, as it would only yield them 4 points in one round but likely lead to mutual hare choices (2 points each) in subsequent rounds.\n\nPsychologist: The consistent behavior from both sides indicates a tacit agreement to maximize mutual benefit. In repeated interactions like this, maintaining cooperation typically leads to the best long-term outcomes.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend continuing with stag to maintain the established cooperative pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Maintaining our mutually beneficial cooperation strategy."

Three consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation indicates a strong tacit agreement between players. At this point, deviating would not only be irrational from a game theory perspective but would also violate established social norms of reciprocity.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our opponent has demonstrated consistent cooperative behavior. They clearly understand that the stag-stag equilibrium maximizes both players' outcomes. There's no strategic advantage to deviating from this successful pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: The probability that our opponent will continue choosing stag is very high based on their past behavior. The expected value of choosing stag (likely 6 points) far exceeds the expected value of choosing hare (4 points if opponent chooses stag, but likely to result in worse outcomes in future rounds).\n\nPsychologist: Consistency in behavior builds trust and predictability.
