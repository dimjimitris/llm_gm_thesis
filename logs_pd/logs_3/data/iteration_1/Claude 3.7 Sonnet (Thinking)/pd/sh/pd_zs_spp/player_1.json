    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

            "text": "I need to make a strategic decision for this game. Let me collaborate with some experts to determine the best move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a classic Stag Hunt game where coordination leads to the best mutual outcome. The payoff matrix shows that stag-stag gives the highest collective reward (6 points each), but choosing stag carries risk if the other player chooses hare (you'd only get 1 point). Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, and possibly 4 if the other player chooses stag.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, there's no history to analyze. However, research suggests many players tend to start with cooperative moves in repeated games. If your opponent is rational and understands the game structure, they might choose stag hoping for mutual benefit.\n\nRisk Analyst: The question is whether to prioritize maximum potential gain or minimize potential loss. Stag offers the highest ceiling (6) but lowest floor (1). Hare guarantees at least 2 points with potential for 4. Consider your risk tolerance and objectives.\n\nGame Theory Expert: One more point - since this seems to be a multi-round game, your first move also sends a signal about your willingness to cooperate. Choosing stag can establish trust and potentially lead to sustained mutual cooperation.\n\nAfter considering all perspectives, I believe choosing stag offers the best long-term potential, despite the initial risk.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to aim for mutual benefit and establish cooperative intentions."

This is the Pareto optimal outcome. In repeated games, maintaining this cooperation typically leads to the highest long-term payoff for both players.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Your opponent chose stag in the first round, which signals their willingness to cooperate. Players who start with cooperative moves often continue with them, especially after a successful outcome. Breaking this trust could trigger retaliation.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk calculation has shifted now that we have history. Your opponent has demonstrated cooperation once, increasing the probability they'll cooperate again. The expected value of choosing stag has improved compared to the first round.\n\nStrategic Planner: Consider the long-term consequences. If you defect by choosing hare, you might gain 4 points this round instead of 6, but you risk establishing a pattern of mutual distrust that results in hare-hare (2 points each) in future rounds. The cumulative loss would outweigh the one-time gain.\n\nBased on this collaborative analysis, maintaining cooperation appears to be the optimal strategy.\n\n[move] stag I'll continue with stag to maintain our mutually beneficial cooperation."

This suggests we've reached a stable cooperative equilibrium, which is theoretically optimal in repeated games.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Your opponent has consistently chosen stag twice now, which strongly indicates their strategy is to maximize mutual benefit. Players tend to continue with strategies that have been successful, and deviating from this pattern without provocation would be unusual.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk profile continues to improve with each cooperative round. With two rounds of evidence that your opponent chooses stag, the expected value of continuing with stag is higher than in previous rounds.\n\nTrust Expert: You've now built mutual trust through repeated cooperation. In repeated games, this trust foundation is valuable and typically leads to sustained optimal outcomes. There's no strategic reason to break this trust at this point.\n\nThe collaborative analysis clearly indicates that maintaining our cooperative strategy is optimal.\n\n[move] stag I'll continue choosing stag to maintain our mutually beneficial pattern."

Your opponent has demonstrated reliable cooperation, and there's no reason to expect them to deviate now. Players typically maintain successful strategies, especially when they're yielding maximum possible rewards.\n\nRisk Analyst: After three cooperative rounds, the probability of your opponent continuing to choose stag is extremely high. The expected value calculation heavily favors continuing with stag. Any short-term gain from choosing hare would likely be offset by subsequent mutual distrust.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we're playing multiple rounds, the cumulative benefit of maintaining stag-stag cooperation (6 points per round) significantly outweighs the one-time advantage of defection followed by potential mutual hare choices (4 points once, then 2 points per round thereafter).\n\nThe consensus remains clear - maintain cooperation for optimal results.\n\n[move] stag I'll continue with stag to maintain our successful cooperative strategy."

Your opponent has proven to be reliably cooperative, and this pattern tends to be self-reinforcing. The psychological contract between you is well-established.\n\nRisk Analyst: With four rounds of evidence that your opponent chooses stag, the probability they will continue is extremely high. The expected value calculation overwhelmingly favors continuing with stag, as there's minimal risk and maximum reward.\n\nGame Theorist: Even if we consider the possibility of a finite game, we have no indication this is the final round, so maintaining cooperation remains optimal.

The expected value calculation remains overwhelmingly in favor of continuing with stag.\n\nStrategic Planner: We've accumulated 78 points so far (6 points \u00d7 13 rounds) - the maximum possible score achievable. There remains no strategic reason whatsoever to deviate from this optimal pattern.\n\nAll experts unanimously agree that maintaining our successful cooperative strategy continues to be optimal.\n\n[move] stag I'll continue choosing stag to maintain our proven optimal strategy."
