I got 6 points.\n\n2. I notice a concerning pattern - after successful mutual cooperation (stag-stag), if I choose stag again, my opponent has chosen hare 2/2 times.\n\n3. Specifically, after Round 6 and Round 10 cooperation, they defected when I tried to continue cooperation.\n\n4. We just achieved cooperation again in Round 14, so there's a significant risk they'll choose hare this round.\n\n5. My average points by strategy:\n   - Stag: 3 points average (21 points over 7 rounds)\n   - Hare: 3.14 points average (22 points over 7 rounds)\n\n6. To avoid being exploited again, I'll choose hare this round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare to protect against my opponent's likely defection based on their historical pattern.\n\n[move] hare",

After mutual stag cooperation, if I choose stag again, my opponent has chosen hare 2/2 times, giving me 1 point each time.\n2. After mutual stag cooperation, I have never chosen hare, so I don't know how they'd respond.\n\nThe safest play based on historical patterns would be to choose hare. However, I also want to see if we can maintain cooperation for multiple rounds.\n\nGiven the consistent pattern where my opponent defects after mutual cooperation, I think the safer play is to choose hare this round.",
