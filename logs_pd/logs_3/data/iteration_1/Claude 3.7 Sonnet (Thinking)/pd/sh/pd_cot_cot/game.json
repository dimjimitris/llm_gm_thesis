However, choosing \"stag\" is risky - if the other player chooses \"hare\", I only get 1 point\n3.

So \"hare\" is the risk-averse strategy while \"stag\" is the strategy with highest potential payoff\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I need to decide which strategy is most likely to succeed. \n\nIn this case, I think choosing \"stag\" is reasonable for the first round for a few reasons:\n1.

In that case, I would get 6 points by choosing stag versus only 4 points by choosing hare.\n\nEven after 11 rounds of cooperation, there's no strategic reason for me to defect - choosing stag still gives me more points than choosing hare when the other player is likely to choose stag.\n\nThe rational choice remains to continue with stag.",
