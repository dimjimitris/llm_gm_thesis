I've accumulated 30 points so far (5 rounds \u00d7 6 points).\n\nFor this 6th round, I need to decide whether to continue with stag or switch to hare. Let me think through the implications:\n\nIf I continue choosing stag:\n- If they also choose stag (which seems highly likely based on history): We both get 6 points\n- If they switch to hare: I get only 1 point, they get 4 points\n\nIf I switch to hare:\n- If they choose stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 point\n- If they also choose hare: We both get 2 points\n\nGiven that we've established a strong pattern of cooperation that benefits us both maximally, switching to hare would be a breach of the implicit trust that's been built up. While I could potentially get 4 points once by defecting, this would likely trigger a response in future rounds that would lead to lower point totals overall.\n\nThe cooperation we've established is stable and optimal - we're both getting the maximum possible points per round. There's no rational reason to deviate from this strategy unless I suspect the game is ending soon and want to try to get a one-time advantage (which would be short-sighted).\n\nI'll continue with the stag strategy to maintain our mutual cooperation.",
