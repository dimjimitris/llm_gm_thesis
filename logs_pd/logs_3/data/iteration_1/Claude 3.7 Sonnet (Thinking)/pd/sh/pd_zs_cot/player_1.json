    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider this is the first round with a new player:\n   - No history to base decisions on\n   - Need to balance risk vs. reward\n\n3. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - Stag offers highest mutual benefit (6 points each) if we coordinate\n   - Hare is safer (guaranteed minimum of 2 points)\n   - Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual gain\n\n4. Since the stag-stag outcome provides the highest total payoff and represents mutually beneficial cooperation, I'll choose stag to establish a cooperative norm.\n\n[move] stag"

            "text": "Steps:\n\n1. Review our extensive game history:\n   - Fifteen consecutive rounds of mutual stag choices\n   - Perfect cooperation throughout the entire game\n   - Maximum reward (6 points) achieved in every round\n   - Total accumulated: 90 points\n\n2. Evaluate the exceptional stability of our pattern:\n   - Fifteen rounds of consistent choices demonstrates an extraordinarily robust pattern\n   - Both players have shown unwavering commitment to the optimal mutual strategy\n   - Our cooperative equilibrium has remained perfectly stable\n   - No indication whatsoever of any potential strategic shift\n\n3. Apply game theoretical reasoning:\n   - In repeated games with indefinite horizons, sustained cooperation at the optimal equilibrium maximizes returns\n   - Our established pattern yields the theoretical maximum joint welfare possible\n   - The expected value of continued cooperation far exceeds any alternative strategy\n   - After fifteen successful rounds, any deviation would be strategically irrational\n\n4. Given our extended history of perfect cooperation and consistently optimal outcomes, maintaining the stag strategy remains the clear rational choice.\n\n[move] stag"
