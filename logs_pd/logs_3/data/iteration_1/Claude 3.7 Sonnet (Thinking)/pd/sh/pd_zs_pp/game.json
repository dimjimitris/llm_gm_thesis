It seems like our opponent is switching their strategy each round. In the first round, they chose hare when I chose stag. In the second round, they chose stag when I chose hare.\n\nThis pattern suggests they might be using a simple alternating strategy, or they might be trying to predict and counter my moves.\n\nIf they're alternating, they'll likely choose hare this round.
