Last round, I cooperated and the opponent also cooperated, which gave us both 6 points - the best individual outcome. \n\nLet's review the game history:\nRound 1: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 I got 1 point\nRound 2: I defected, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 4 points\nRound 3: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 I got 1 point\nRound 4: I defected, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 4 points\nRound 5: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2 points\nRound 6: I cooperated, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 6 points\n\nSo far, it seems the opponent was initially alternating between defection and cooperation, regardless of what I did. However, the last two rounds suggest a possible shift. They defected when I defected, then cooperated when I cooperated.\n\nGiven that mutual cooperation gives the highest individual payoff (6 points each), the rational move would be to continue cooperation in hopes of maintaining this mutually beneficial equilibrium. If they also choose to cooperate, we both get the maximum points.\n\nI'll cooperate again to signal my willingness to maintain the cooperative equilibrium.",
