Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Reviewing our extended game history:\n   - Fourteen consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation\n   - Consistent 6 points earned per round\n   - Current accumulated score: 84 points (14 \u00d7 6)\n\n2. Analyzing the established pattern:\n   - Both players have demonstrated perfect cooperation throughout all rounds\n   - Our interaction shows exceptional stability and reliability\n   - This consistent pattern has yielded optimal outcomes for both players\n\n3. Mathematical evaluation:\n   - Expected value of continued cooperation: 6 points per round indefinitely\n   - Expected value of defection: 4 points once, then likely 2 points per round thereafter\n   - The differential grows larger with each additional round\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - The consistency across 14 rounds strongly suggests the other player will continue cooperating\n   - Disrupting a successful pattern introduces unnecessary risk\n   - The optimal Nash equilibrium in this repeated game is maintained through cooperation\n\n5. Based on extended history, mathematical analysis, and game theory principles, cooperation remains the optimal choice.\n\n[move] cooperation"

Reviewing our extensive game history:\n   - Fifteen consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation\n   - Consistent optimal outcome of 6 points per round\n   - Current accumulated score: 90 points (15 \u00d7 6)\n\n2. Analyzing the established pattern:\n   - The other player has maintained perfect cooperation across all 15 rounds\n   - Our interaction demonstrates remarkable stability and predictability\n   - This consistent pattern has maximized point accumulation for both players\n\n3. Evaluating strategic options:\n   - Continued cooperation: Maintains the optimal 6 points per round\n   - Defection: Would yield 4 points once, but likely damage the established relationship\n   - Long-term expected value strongly favors cooperation (6 points/round vs. potential 2 points/round after defection)\n\n4. Applying game theory principles:\n   - In iterated games with indefinite endpoints, cooperation represents the stable optimal strategy\n   - Our established pattern represents the most efficient point-generating equilibrium\n   - The consistency across 15 rounds reinforces the predictability of continued cooperation\n\n5. After 15 successful rounds of cooperation, all evidence and mathematical analysis support maintaining this optimal strategy.\n\n[move] cooperation"
