Round 14: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 I got 1 point\n\nI now see an extremely consistent pattern: my opponent is playing the opposite of what I did in the previous round.\n- When I defect, they respond with cooperation in the next round\n- When I cooperate, they respond with defection in the next round\n\nMy test in Round 14 confirmed this pattern - I cooperated after defecting, and they defected. This pattern has held true for the last 6 rounds without exception.\n\nGiven this predictable pattern, the rational choice is clear. If I defect now, based on the established pattern, my opponent will cooperate, giving me 4 points rather than the 1 point I'd receive if I cooperated.\n\n[move] (Exploiting opponent's consistent pattern of doing the opposite of my previous move) defection",

Every time I cooperate (Rounds 2, 4, 9, 11, 14), my opponent defects. Every time I defect (Rounds 3, 10, 12, 13), my opponent cooperates.\n\nThis suggests my opponent might be using a strategy that's exactly opposite of tit-for-tat - they're doing the opposite of what I did in the previous round.\n\nGiven this strong pattern, if I defect in this round, I can expect my opponent to cooperate, giving me 4 points. If I cooperate, based on the pattern, my opponent will defect, giving me only 1 point.\n\nI've tested cooperation in Round 14 and got exploited again, confirming the pattern.

For several rounds, they were consistently doing the opposite of my previous move, but now they've defected after I defected.\n\nThis suggests they may have recognized that I identified their pattern and are now adapting their strategy. Looking at their overall behavior, they've defected more often when I cooperate (rounds 2, 4, 9, 11, 14) than cooperated when I defect.\n\nGiven this history and the unpredictable shift, I need to consider:\n- The safest minimum outcome (2 points with mutual defection)\n- The risk of getting only 1 point if I cooperate and they defect again\n- The potential for 4 points if I defect and they cooperate\n\n[move] (Responding to opponent's unpredictable shift in strategy) defection",

Round 15: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2 points\n\nInteresting. My prediction that my opponent would cooperate after my defection didn't hold this time. This breaks the pattern I had identified. Let me try to understand what might be happening:\n\n1. The pattern I observed (opponent does opposite of my previous move) held true from rounds 9-14, but broke in round 15.\n2. My opponent might have realized I was exploiting their pattern and changed strategies.\n3. They might be using a more complex strategy than I initially thought.\n4. Looking at their full move history: C, D, C, D, D, D, C, C, D, C, D, C, C, D, D\n\nLet me reconsider my strategy. If my opponent is adapting to counter my exploitation of their pattern, I need to be flexible too. \n\nSince we've just had mutual defection (which gives a suboptimal 2 points each), one approach could be to try cooperation to see if we can break out of this and return to mutual cooperation (which gives 6 points each).\n\nHowever, I've also noticed that when I cooperate, my opponent frequently defects (rounds 2, 4, 9, 11, 14). This makes cooperation risky.\n\nLet me think about the game theory aspects:\n- If I defect and they defect, we both get 2 points\n- If I defect and they cooperate, I get 4 points\n- If I cooperate and they defect, I get only 1 point\n- If I cooperate and they cooperate, we both get 6 points\n\nGiven the uncertainty about their next move and their tendency to defect when I cooperate, defection seems safer. It guarantees I get at least 2 points rather than risking getting only 1 point.",
