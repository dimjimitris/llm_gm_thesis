The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Based on this observed pattern, if I cooperate this round, my opponent will likely defect again, resulting in me getting just 1 point. However, if I defect, they will likely cooperate, giving me 4 points.\n\nWhile mutual cooperation would be ideal (6 points each), my opponent has repeatedly shown they exploit cooperation rather than sustain it.

My opponent has now cooperated for three consecutive rounds (10, 12, 13), with the last two coming despite my defection.\n\nThis is interesting - they're cooperating consistently even though I've been defecting. This could indicate:\n1. They're trying to establish a cooperative relationship\n2. They're using a forgiving strategy to break the defection cycle\n3. They're following a predetermined pattern regardless of my choices\n\nWhile defecting has given me 4 points consistently in recent rounds, mutual cooperation would yield 6 points for each of us. My opponent's continued cooperation suggests they might maintain this behavior if I cooperate as well.\n\n[move] (Testing if opponent will maintain cooperation for mutual benefit) cooperation"

This pattern has held true for the last 6 rounds without exception.\n\nGiven this predictable pattern, the rational choice is clear.

For several rounds, they were consistently doing the opposite of my previous move, but now they've defected after I defected.\n\nThis suggests they may have recognized that I identified their pattern and are now adapting their strategy. Looking at their overall behavior, they've defected more often when I cooperate (rounds 2, 4, 9, 11, 14) than cooperated when I defect.\n\nGiven this history and the unpredictable shift, I need to consider:\n- The safest minimum outcome (2 points with mutual defection)\n- The risk of getting only 1 point if I cooperate and they defect again\n- The potential for 4 points if I defect and they cooperate\n\n[move] (Responding to opponent's unpredictable shift in strategy) defection"
