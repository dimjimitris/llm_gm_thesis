Our cumulative total is now 90 points each (15 rounds \u00d7 6 points).\n\nThis consistent pattern of mutual cooperation has proven to be the optimal strategy for both of us, maximizing our collective and individual outcomes. The game theory behind this is clear - while either of us could defect to try to gain a short-term advantage (getting 9 points in a single round), this would likely break the trust and lead to mutual defection in future rounds, which would result in only 2 points per round.\n\nI'll continue with cooperation for this next round, maintaining our successful strategy.",
