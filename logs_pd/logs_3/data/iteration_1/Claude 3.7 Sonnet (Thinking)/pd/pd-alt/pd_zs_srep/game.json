Continue cooperating - This risks me getting repeatedly exploited if they keep defecting\n2. Defect in response - This follows a tit-for-tat strategy, which can be effective\n3. Use a more complex strategy\n\nSince they defected in the previous round, a reasonable approach would be to defect in this round.

Let's see:\nRound 1: No previous move for them to copy\nRound 2: They cooperated (my Round 1 move was cooperation) - MATCH\nRound 3: They defected (my Round 2 move was defection) - MATCH\nRound 4: They cooperated (my Round 3 move was cooperation) - MATCH\nRound 5: They defected (my Round 4 move was defection) - MATCH\nRound 6: They defected (my Round 5 move was defection) - MATCH\nRound 7: They defected (my Round 6 move was defection) - MATCH\nRound 8: They cooperated (my Round 7 move was cooperation) - MATCH\n\nThat's it! The opponent seems to be playing a standard tit-for-tat strategy, copying my move from the previous round. The exception was Round 1, where they had no previous move to base on and chose to defect.\n\nGiven this pattern, if I defect now, they are likely to defect in the next round. If I cooperate now, they are likely to cooperate in the next round.\n\nSince mutual cooperation yields 6 points (3 points each) and mutual defection yields 4 points (2 points each), cooperation seems like the better long-term strategy if I can establish it with this tit-for-tat player.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful. I should verify this pattern with one more round. If I cooperate now and they cooperate in the next round (following tit-for-tat), then I'll have strong evidence for this pattern.\n\nSo my best move for this round is to cooperate, aiming to establish a pattern of mutual cooperation.",
