Continue cooperating - This risks me getting only 1 point again if they continue to defect, but maintains the possibility of returning to mutual cooperation (4 points each).\n2. Switch to defection - This would \"punish\" their previous defection. If they defect again, we both get 2 points. If they cooperate, I get 6 points and they get only 1.\n\nGiven that my opponent has demonstrated willingness to defect after establishing cooperation, it seems prudent to switch to defection for this round. This is consistent with a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy which is known to be effective in repeated prisoner's dilemma games - I cooperate initially, then mirror whatever my opponent did in the previous round.\n\nIf my opponent is testing me, responding with defection signals that I won't continue to cooperate if they defect.
