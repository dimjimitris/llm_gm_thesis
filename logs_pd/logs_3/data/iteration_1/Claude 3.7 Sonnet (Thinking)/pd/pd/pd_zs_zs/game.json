Continue cooperation: If we both continue to cooperate, we'll both get 4 points, which is what we've been achieving consistently.\n\n2. Switch to defection: If I defect while the other player cooperates, I would get 6 points and they would get 1 point. This would give me a one-time gain of 2 extra points. However, this could break the trust we've established, and the other player might retaliate by defecting in future rounds. If we both end up defecting, we'd get only 2 points each, which is worse than the 4 points from mutual cooperation.\n\nGiven our history of 14 rounds of consistent cooperation, there's strong evidence that the other player is committed to a cooperative strategy. Breaking this pattern for a short-term gain would be risky and potentially lead to worse outcomes in the long run.\n\nThe optimal decision is to continue with cooperation to maintain our established pattern of mutual trust and consistent 4-point rewards.",

If we both cooperate again: We each get 4 points (continuing our established pattern)\n2. If I defect and they cooperate: I get 6 points and they get 1 point (a short-term gain for me)\n3. If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point and they get 6 points (a loss for me)\n4. If we both defect: We each get 2 points (worse than mutual cooperation)\n\nSince the other player has consistently chosen cooperation for 15 rounds straight, there's strong evidence they're committed to a cooperative strategy. Defecting now would give me a one-time advantage but could break the trust we've established, potentially leading to worse outcomes in future rounds if they respond with defection.\n\nThe steady 4 points per round from mutual cooperation is better than alternating between 6 points and 1 point (which averages to 3.5 points per round) if we were to enter a cycle of retaliation.\n\nI'll continue with cooperation to maintain our established pattern of mutual trust and consistent rewards.",
