Let me analyze the complete history of our game:\n   - Round 1: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, they got 6)\n   - Round 2: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 6, they got 1)\n   - Round 3: I defected, opponent defected (We both got 2)\n   - Round 4: I cooperated, opponent cooperated (We both got 4)\n   - Round 5: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, they got 6)\n   - Round 6: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 6, they got 1)\n   - Round 7: I defected, opponent defected (We both got 2)\n   - Round 8: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 6, they got 1)\n   - Round 9: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, they got 6)\n   - Round 10: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 6, they got 1)\n   - Round 11: I defected, opponent defected (We both got 2)\n   - Round 12: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 6, they got 1)\n   - Round 13: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, they got 6)\n   - Round 14: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 6, they got 1)\n\n2. The pattern remains extremely consistent:\n   - After my defections, my opponent alternates between cooperation and defection\n   - If I defect this round, based on the pattern, they will likely defect\n\n3. My points by strategy:\n   - When I cooperate: 8 points in 5 rounds (1.6 points per round)\n   - When I defect: 42 points in 9 rounds (4.67 points per round)\n\n4. Even though the pattern suggests I'll get only 2 points with defection this round, this is still better than the likely 1 point I'd get with cooperation.\n\n5. The optimal strategy given this opponent's pattern is to continue with defection.\n\n[move] defection",
