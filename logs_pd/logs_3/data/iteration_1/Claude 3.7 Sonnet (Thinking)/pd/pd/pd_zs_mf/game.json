The opponent might be using a strategy like \"tit-for-tat with initial defection\" or some variant\n2. They might be testing my response to defection\n3. They could simply be trying to maximize their own score without regard for long-term mutual benefit\n\nGiven this development, I need to decide how to respond. In classic prisoner's dilemma theory, there are a few standard strategies:\n\n1. Always cooperate - This maximizes potential mutual benefit but can be exploited\n2. Always defect - This ensures I'm never the \"sucker\" but leads to suboptimal outcomes if both players defect\n3. Tit-for-tat - Match what the opponent did in the previous round\n4. Tit-for-two-tats - Only defect after the opponent defects twice in a row\n5. Pavlov/Win-stay-lose-shift - If I got a good outcome (4 or 6 points), repeat my last move; if I got a bad outcome (1 or 2 points), change my move\n\nSince the opponent just defected, a tit-for-tat strategy would suggest I defect in this round. This serves two purposes:\n1. It signals that I won't allow repeated exploitation\n2. It teaches the opponent that defection leads to mutual loss (if they defect again, we both get 2 points instead of the 4 we could get by cooperating)\n\nI think I'll use a tit-for-tat strategy for now, which means defecting in this round.

When I also defected in response, we both ended up with 2 points, which is less optimal than the 4 points we could get with mutual cooperation.\n\nI could try to re-establish cooperation to see if we can get back to the mutually beneficial outcome. If my opponent is playing some kind of tit-for-tat strategy, they might cooperate again if I cooperate. However, there's a risk they might defect again.\n\nGiven that mutual defection (2 points each) is better than me cooperating while they defect (1 point for me, 6 for them), but mutual cooperation (4 points each) is better than mutual defection, I think it's worth trying cooperation again to see if we can break out of the mutual defection equilibrium.\n\nI'll choose cooperation for this round.",

Let me think about the expected value:\n- If I defect: Almost certainly 2 points\n- If I cooperate: \n  * 1 point if opponent defects (highly likely based on history)\n  * 4 points if opponent cooperates (seems unlikely given their pattern)\n\nSince the opponent has consistently defected for the past 5 rounds, the rational move is to continue defecting.
