The payoff structure shows:\n   - Both cooperate: 4 points each (good outcome)\n   - Both defect: 2 points each (worse outcome)\n   - One cooperates, one defects: 1 point for cooperator, 6 points for defector (unbalanced)\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies.\n4. In a single round, defection is technically the dominant strategy since it guarantees at least 2 points versus potentially only 1 point.\n5. However, if this is a multi-round game, starting with cooperation can establish goodwill and potentially lead to mutual cooperation (4 points each) in future rounds.\n6. The long-term benefit of establishing mutual cooperation (4 points repeatedly) outweighs the short-term gain from defection.\n\n[move] I choose to cooperate as an opening move to signal willingness for mutual benefit.\n"
