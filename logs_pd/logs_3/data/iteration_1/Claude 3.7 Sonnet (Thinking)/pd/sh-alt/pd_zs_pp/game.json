However, (stag, stag) is Pareto-optimal since both players get 4 points instead of 2.\n\nIf I assume the other player is also trying to maximize points and might be reasoning the same way, choosing stag would be better for mutual benefit. However, choosing stag is riskier because if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n\nChoosing hare is a safer choice as the worst outcome is 2 points, but it doesn't allow for the optimal mutual outcome.\n\nSince this is the first round with a fresh player, I'll choose stag to aim for the Pareto-optimal outcome.

My opponent has shown willingness to cooperate with stag choices\n\nSince we just had a successful stag-stag round, it might be tempting to continue that cooperation.
