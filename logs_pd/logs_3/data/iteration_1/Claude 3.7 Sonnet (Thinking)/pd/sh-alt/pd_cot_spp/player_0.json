    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic Stag Hunt game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare).\n\n3. The (stag, stag) outcome is Pareto efficient - it gives the best collective outcome (8 total points) and is fair (4 points each).\n\n4. However, choosing stag carries risk - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n\n5. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I'll signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n6. Choosing stag demonstrates trust and an intent to achieve the optimal collective outcome.\n\n[move] stag"

Evaluating our extensive gameplay history:\n   - We've now completed 14 rounds with perfect cooperation\n   - Both players have consistently chosen stag in every round\n   - Each player has accumulated 56 total points (4 points \u00d7 14 rounds)\n   - Our cooperative pattern has demonstrated remarkable stability\n\n2. Game theory analysis:\n   - We've established and maintained the Pareto-optimal (stag, stag) equilibrium\n   - This equilibrium yields the highest sustainable joint payoff\n   - The consistency of our choices indicates a mutual understanding of optimal play\n   - No rational incentive exists to disrupt this beneficial pattern\n\n3. Considering trust dynamics:\n   - Fourteen consecutive cooperative rounds represents an exceptional level of trust\n   - The other player has shown unwavering commitment to cooperation\n   - Mutual trust has allowed us to consistently achieve optimal outcomes\n\n4. Strategic conclusion:\n   - Continue with the proven cooperative strategy\n   - Maintain the stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium we've established\n\n[move] stag"

Reviewing our extensive cooperation record:\n   - We've now completed 15 rounds with perfect cooperation\n   - Both players have chosen stag in every round without exception\n   - Each player has accumulated 60 total points (4 points \u00d7 15 rounds)\n   - Our pattern of mutual trust and optimal play is exceptionally stable\n\n2. Strategic analysis:\n   - The Nash equilibrium we've maintained (stag, stag) continues to provide optimal outcomes\n   - This pattern represents a successful tacit agreement between players\n   - Consistency across 15 rounds demonstrates strong strategic alignment\n   - No new information suggests changing this successful approach\n\n3. Risk/reward evaluation:\n   - Deviating would risk disrupting a perfectly functioning cooperative system\n   - The temporary gain from defection (2 additional points) is minimal compared to the risk\n   - The expected value of continued cooperation far exceeds any short-term advantage\n   - Maintaining our established pattern continues to be the rational choice\n\n4.
