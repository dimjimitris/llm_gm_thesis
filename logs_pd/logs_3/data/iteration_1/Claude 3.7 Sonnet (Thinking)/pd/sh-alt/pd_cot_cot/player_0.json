Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

If I choose stag and they also choose stag, we both get the second-best outcome (4 points).\n\n5. If I choose hare, I guarantee myself at least 2 points, and possibly 6 points if they choose stag.\n\n6. For the first round, I'll signal willingness to cooperate by choosing stag. This could establish mutual cooperation which benefits both players in the long run.\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing stag to aim for mutual benefit.

We've now maintained perfect cooperation for fourteen consecutive rounds.\n\n3. This remarkable consistency demonstrates an extremely stable and mutually beneficial relationship.\n\n4. My opponent has shown perfect reliability across all fourteen rounds of our interaction.\n\n5. Evaluating my options:\n   - Continuing with stag maintains our proven cooperative equilibrium (4 points each)\n   - Switching to hare might yield a one-time gain of 6 points, but would break fourteen rounds of established trust\n   - Breaking such well-established cooperation would almost certainly lead to mutual defection and inferior outcomes\n\n6. The expected value from continued cooperation (steady 4 points per round) significantly outweighs any potential gain from defection.\n\n7. With such an extensive history of successful mutual cooperation, maintaining our strategy remains clearly optimal.\n\n[move] stag I'll continue choosing stag to maintain our exceptionally successful cooperative relationship."
