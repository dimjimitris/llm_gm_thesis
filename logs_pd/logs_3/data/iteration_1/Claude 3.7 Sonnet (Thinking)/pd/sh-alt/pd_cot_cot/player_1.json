Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the possible outcomes:\n   - If we both choose stag: we both get 4 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - If we both choose hare: we both get 2 points (mediocre for both)\n   - If I choose stag but they choose hare: I get only 1 point while they get 6 (worst for me)\n   - If I choose hare but they choose stag: I get 6 points while they get 1 (best for me individually)\n\n2. This is my first interaction with this player, so I have no history to base my decision on.\n\n3. The stag choice represents cooperation for mutual benefit but carries risk if the other player defects.\n\n4. The hare choice is safer since the worst outcome is 2 points, but limits potential gains.\n\n5. Since this is the first round, I'll signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n6. The total points from mutual cooperation (4+4=8) exceeds any other combination, making it the socially optimal choice.\n\n[move] stag I choose cooperation for our mutual benefit"

The total social welfare is maximized when both players choose stag (8 total points vs. 7 total points in mixed strategies).\n\n5. By continuing to choose stag, I signal ongoing trustworthiness.\n\n6. While choosing hare could yield 6 points in the short term (if they stick with stag), this would likely damage cooperation for future rounds.\n\n7.
