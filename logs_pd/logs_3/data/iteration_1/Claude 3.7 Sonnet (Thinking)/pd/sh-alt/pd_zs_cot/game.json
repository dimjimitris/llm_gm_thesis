      "reasoning_text": "We've now completed fifteen consecutive rounds with perfect cooperation, with both players choosing stag in every round. This has consistently given us the optimal mutual outcome of 4 points per round, bringing our total score to 60 points each.\n\nThe consistency of our choices shows a deep mutual understanding of the benefits of cooperation in this game. Let's continue to analyze the situation:\n\n1. Pattern of cooperation: 15 consecutive rounds of mutual stag choices\n2. Current points: 15 rounds \u00d7 4 points = 60 points each\n3. Alternative strategy evaluation:\n   - If I were to defect now by choosing hare, I might get 6 points this round\n   - However, this would likely break trust and lead to my opponent choosing hare in future rounds\n   - This would result in us both getting only 2 points per round going forward, which is worse than our current 4 points\n\nThe mathematics strongly favors continuing our established strategy. The consistent 4 points per round through cooperation is optimal for long-term gain compared to any short-term benefit from defection.\n\nI'll continue with stag to maintain our successful cooperative equilibrium.",
