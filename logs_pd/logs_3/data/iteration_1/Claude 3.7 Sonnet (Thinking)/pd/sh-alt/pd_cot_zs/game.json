Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each (good mutual outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (mediocre mutual outcome)\n   - Mismatched choices: 6 points for hare chooser, 1 point for stag chooser\n\n2. Consider possible strategies:\n   - Choosing stag is cooperative and can lead to the best mutual outcome\n   - Choosing hare is safer as it guarantees at least 2 points\n   - If my opponent chooses stag, I'd get 6 points by choosing hare\n   - If my opponent chooses hare, I'd get 2 points by choosing hare (vs 1 for stag)\n\n3. For the first round with no history:\n   - I want to signal cooperation\n   - Choosing stag shows willingness for mutual benefit\n   - If opponent also cooperates, we both benefit\n   - If they choose hare, I can adjust my strategy in future rounds\n\n4. Decision calculation:\n   - Expected value with stag: (0.5 \u00d7 4) + (0.5 \u00d7 1) = 2.5 points\n   - Expected value with hare: (0.5 \u00d7 6) + (0.5 \u00d7 2) = 4 points\n   - Purely mathematically, hare has higher expected value\n   - But I'll start with cooperation to establish trust\n\n[move] stag"

Let me think through this strategically:\n\n1. If we both choose stag, we both get a good outcome (4 points each).\n2. If we both choose hare, we both get an okay outcome (2 points each).\n3. If we choose differently, one player gets a great outcome (6 points) and the other gets a poor outcome (1 point).\n\nIn terms of expected value, assuming random play from my opponent:\n- If I choose stag: 50% chance of 4 points, 50% chance of 1 point = 2.5 points on average\n- If I choose hare: 50% chance of 6 points, 50% chance of 2 points = 4 points on average\n\nFrom a purely mathematical perspective, choosing hare has a higher expected value if I have no prior information about my opponent's tendencies.\n\nHowever, this is also a coordination game. If both players can somehow coordinate on choosing stag, that's better than both choosing hare. The challenge is that coordination requires trust.\n\nSince this is the first round and I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any history to base my decision on.
