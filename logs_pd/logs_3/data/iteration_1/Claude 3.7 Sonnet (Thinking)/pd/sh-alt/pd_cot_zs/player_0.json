Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each (good mutual outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (mediocre mutual outcome)\n   - Mismatched choices: 6 points for hare chooser, 1 point for stag chooser\n\n2. Consider possible strategies:\n   - Choosing stag is cooperative and can lead to the best mutual outcome\n   - Choosing hare is safer as it guarantees at least 2 points\n   - If my opponent chooses stag, I'd get 6 points by choosing hare\n   - If my opponent chooses hare, I'd get 2 points by choosing hare (vs 1 for stag)\n\n3. For the first round with no history:\n   - I want to signal cooperation\n   - Choosing stag shows willingness for mutual benefit\n   - If opponent also cooperates, we both benefit\n   - If they choose hare, I can adjust my strategy in future rounds\n\n4. Decision calculation:\n   - Expected value with stag: (0.5 \u00d7 4) + (0.5 \u00d7 1) = 2.5 points\n   - Expected value with hare: (0.5 \u00d7 6) + (0.5 \u00d7 2) = 4 points\n   - Purely mathematically, hare has higher expected value\n   - But I'll start with cooperation to establish trust\n\n[move] stag"

Analyze the established equilibrium:\n   - Extraordinarily stable cooperative relationship\n   - Both players have demonstrated consistent commitment to optimal joint outcomes\n   - Thirteen consecutive cooperative choices establish exceptionally strong mutual trust\n   - The pattern shows remarkable resilience and reliability\n\n3. Consider strategic options:\n   - Continue cooperation: Steady 4 points per round\n   - Defect to hare: One-time gain of 6 points, but destroys established trust\n   - After such extensive history, defection would be particularly irrational\n\n4. Calculate expected outcomes:\n   - The minor gain from defection (2 extra points) is trivial compared to potential losses\n   - Breaking cooperation would likely result in mutual hare (2 points per round)\n   - Long-term expected value clearly favors continued cooperation\n   - The accumulated difference between continued cooperation vs. defection grows with each round\n\n5.
