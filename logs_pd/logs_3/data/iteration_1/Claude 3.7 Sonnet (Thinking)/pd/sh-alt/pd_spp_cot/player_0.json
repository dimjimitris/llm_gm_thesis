    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The stag-stag outcome is Pareto optimal (4,4), while hare-hare is risk-dominant (2,2). Your choice depends on your risk tolerance and expectations about the other player.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we need to balance risk and potential reward. Choosing stag has the highest mutual benefit (4 points) but comes with risk of exploitation (only 1 point if they choose hare). Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and potential for 6 points.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players often start cooperative in repeated games to establish mutual trust. The other player might reason similarly and choose stag for the potential optimal outcome. However, with no prior history, there's uncertainty about their strategy.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given this is the first round, I recommend choosing stag to signal willingness to cooperate. This could establish mutual cooperation for higher sustained payoffs.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. While choosing hare might seem safer, the potential for establishing a cooperative pattern with stag could lead to better long-term results.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate in hopes of achieving the optimal mutual outcome."

In repeated games, maintaining cooperation is usually advantageous for both parties.\n\nStrategic Planner: The fact that they chose stag initially indicates they understand the benefit of cooperation. Continuing with stag maintains the optimal equilibrium of 4 points each round, which is better than the risk-dominant hare-hare equilibrium of 2 points each.\n\nPsychology Expert: First-round cooperation often signals intent for continued cooperation. Players typically reciprocate previous moves, so your opponent will likely choose stag again. Maintaining trust at this stage is crucial for establishing a beneficial pattern.\n\nGame Theory Expert: While there's always temptation to defect and potentially get 6 points by choosing hare while they choose stag, this would likely destroy the cooperative equilibrium for future rounds, resulting in lower overall points.\n\nStrategic Planner: I strongly recommend choosing stag again. The established cooperation pattern should be maintained for maximum mutual benefit.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] stag Continuing cooperation to maintain our mutually beneficial equilibrium."

Both players understand the mutual benefit of choosing stag repeatedly (4 points each) versus the one-time gain from defection (6 points) followed by likely mutual defection (2 points each) in subsequent rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: With two rounds of consistent cooperation, there's a stronger psychological commitment to continue this pattern. Trust has been established, and breaking it now would seem irrational unless you believe the game is ending soon or you have reason to suspect the other player will defect.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In iterated games with unknown endpoints, maintaining cooperation is typically the optimal strategy once established.
