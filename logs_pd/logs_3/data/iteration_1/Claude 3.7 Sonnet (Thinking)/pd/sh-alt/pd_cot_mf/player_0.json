    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare)\n\n3. Choosing stag is risky but potentially more rewarding if the other player also chooses stag.\n\n4. Choosing hare is safer - I'll get at least 2 points, possibly 6.\n\n5. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n6. I'll choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for the optimal mutual outcome (4,4). If successful, this establishes a beneficial pattern.\n\n[move] stag"

We've now had 10 consecutive rounds of (hare, hare), establishing an extremely consistent pattern.\n\n3. My opponent's strategy has been unwavering:\n   - They chose stag only in Round 1\n   - They exploited me both times I attempted cooperation afterward\n   - They've matched my hare choice for 10 consecutive rounds\n\n4. While the (stag, stag) outcome would yield higher returns (4 points each), my opponent has consistently demonstrated they will exploit cooperation.\n\n5. Based on their established pattern over many rounds, choosing stag would almost certainly result in exploitation again.\n\n6. The expected value of choosing hare (2 points) remains higher than the expected value of choosing stag (likely 1 point based on opponent's history).\n\n7. Without any indication of a strategy change from my opponent, the rational choice is to continue with hare.\n\n[move] hare"
