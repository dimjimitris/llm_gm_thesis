    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here are the steps I will consider for my first move:\n\n1. **Analyze the payoff matrix to understand outcomes for each move combination.**\n    - Cooperate-Cooperate: Both get 4 points.\n    - Defect-Defect: Both get 2 points.\n    - Cooperate-Defect: Cooperator gets 1 point, Defector gets 6 points.\n    - Defect-Cooperate: Defector gets 6 points, Cooperator gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Assume the other player will maximize their points as well.**\n    - If I cooperate and the other player defects, I get the least points (1), and they get the most (6).\n    - If I defect and the other player cooperates, I get the most points (6), and they get the least (1).\n\n3. **Consider the risk and potential reward in each scenario.**\n    - Cooperating is risky because it can lead to minimal points if the other player defects.\n    - Defecting has the potential for a high reward if the other player cooperates.\n\n4. **Evaluate potential repeated interactions and reputation.**\n    - Since it's the first move against a fresh player, it's crucial to consider the long-term strategy. Defecting could set a precedent leading to mutual defection in future rounds.\n\n5. **Make an initial move that balances risk and reward.**\n    - Cooperating initially could set a tone for mutual cooperation, potentially leading to higher combined average points over several rounds.\n\nGiven these considerations, I choose to cooperate initially to set a cooperative tone and potentially encourage mutual cooperation in subsequent rounds.\n\n[move] I choose to cooperate to set a cooperative tone and encourage mutual cooperation.\n"

This indicates a pattern of mutual cooperation.\n2. **Assess the potential outcomes for this round**:\n   - If I cooperate and the other player cooperates, we both get 4 points.\n   - If I defect and the other player cooperates, I get 6 points, but risk breaking the cooperative pattern and potentially causing the other player to defect in future rounds.\n   - If I cooperate and the other player defects, I get only 1 point.\n   - If I defect and the other player defects, we both get 2 points.\n3. **Consider the long-term strategy**: Maintaining cooperation encourages the other player to continue cooperating, leading to a stable and high combined score over multiple rounds. Switching to defection might lead to a lower average score if the other player decides to defect in subsequent rounds.\n4. **Evaluate the risk and reward of each choice**:\n   - Cooperating maintains the mutually beneficial strategy with a guaranteed 4 points.\n   - Defecting has the potential for 6 points but carries the risk of ending the cooperative streak and resulting in lower points in future rounds.\n5. **Make a decision based on the above considerations**: Continuing to cooperate maximizes the chance of maintaining a high and stable score for both players over repeated rounds.\n\nGiven these steps, I will continue with the cooperative strategy to foster mutual benefit and maximize points.\n\n[move] (Maintaining cooperation to encourage a stable and high score for both players) cooperation\n"
