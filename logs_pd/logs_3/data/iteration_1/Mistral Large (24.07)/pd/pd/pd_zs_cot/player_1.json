Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "Let's start by analyzing the game mechanics and formulating a strategy. Here are the steps to consider:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix:**\n    - Both cooperate: Both get 4 points.\n    - Both defect: Both get 2 points.\n    - You cooperate, other defects: You get 1 point, other gets 6 points.\n    - You defect, other cooperates: You get 6 points, other gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Evaluate Strategy Options:**\n    - Always cooperate: This could lead to mutual cooperation and a steady gain of 4 points per round. However, if the other player defects, you will lose out (getting only 1 point).\n    - Always defect: This could result in a higher short-term gain if the other player cooperates (6 points for you), but it risks the other player retaliating by defecting, leading to mutual defection and lower points (2 points each).\n    - Tit-for-tat: Start with cooperation, then mimic the other player's previous move. This balances cooperation and the potential for higher points while discouraging defection over time.\n\n3. **Decision for the First Round:**\n    - Given that this is a fresh player and you want to encourage cooperation to maximize joint gains, starting with cooperation is a strategic move. This sets a cooperative tone and can influence the other player to cooperate as well.\n\nFinal decision based on the above steps:\n```\n[move] I will choose cooperation to start off on a cooperative note and encourage mutual high rewards.\n```\nCooperation\n"
