Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyze the opponent:\n   - The opponent is a fresh player, so their strategy is unknown.\n\n3. Consider the first move:\n   - Starting with cooperation can signal a willingness to work together for mutual benefit.\n   - Starting with defection could lead to immediate gain but may also trigger retaliation.\n\n4. Evaluate the benefits of cooperation:\n   - Cooperating initially might encourage the other player to cooperate as well, leading to a higher mutual benefit (4 points each).\n\n5. Decide on the move:\n   - Given the uncertainty about the opponent's strategy, starting with cooperation is a safer choice to establish a potential pattern of mutual cooperation.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] I will cooperate to demonstrate a willingness to work together for mutual benefit.\n\nYour move here: Cooperate\n"

Evaluate the opponent's strategy:\n   - The opponent defected in the previous round, suggesting they might prioritize maximizing their points despite the mutual benefit.\n\n4. Consider the potential outcomes of your next move:\n   - If you cooperate and the opponent defects again, you risk scoring only 1 point.\n   - If you defect, you could score 6 points (if the opponent cooperates) or 2 points (if the opponent also defects).\n\n5. Assess the long-term implications:\n   - Continuing to cooperate while the opponent defects is not sustainable for maximizing your points.\n   - Defecting sends a signal that you will not tolerate continuous exploitation and might encourage the opponent to reconsider their strategy.\n\n6.
