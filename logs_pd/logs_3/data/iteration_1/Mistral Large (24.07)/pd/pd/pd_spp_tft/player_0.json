    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since this is the first round and you're playing against a fresh player, mutual cooperation can set a positive tone and potentially lead to continued cooperation.\n\n**Statistician**: Agreed. If both players choose cooperation, you both get 4 points, which is a balanced and fair outcome. Defection might give you 6 points, but only if the opponent cooperates, which is risky.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Fresh players often tend to cooperate initially as a way to test the waters. Cooperation can build trust and might encourage the opponent to cooperate in future rounds.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the inputs, I'll choose cooperation to start.\n\nMove [move] (Attempting to build trust and encourage cooperation) Cooperation\n\n---\n\n**Round 2: Response to Feedback**\n\n**Game Theorist**: If the opponent cooperated in the first round, this indicates mutual cooperation might continue. If they defected, you need to adapt your strategy to minimize losses.\n\n**Statistician**: Continue to cooperate if the opponent cooperated last round. If they defected, consider defecting to avoid being taken advantage of repeatedly.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: If the opponent cooperated, it shows a willingness to play fair. Continuing to cooperate can reinforce this behavior. If they defected, defecting in response can send a clear signal of your willingness to protect your interests.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Assuming the opponent cooperated last round, I'll continue with cooperation. If they defected, I'll choose defection.\n\nMove [move] (Continuing cooperation for mutual benefit or defecting in response to defection) Cooperation\n\n---\n\n**Round 3: Adjusting Strategy**\n\n**Game Theorist**: If the opponent has been cooperating consistently, continue cooperation. If you see a pattern of alternating cooperation and defection, mirror their strategy to maintain balance.\n\n**Statistician**: Analyze the opponent's previous moves. If they have been consistent in their behavior, respond accordingly. If they seem to be adapting, adapt your strategy as well.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Maintain cooperation if mutual trust is established. Any deviation should be dealt with promptly to signal that you won't tolerate exploitation.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the opponent's behavior, I'll choose my move.\n\nMove [move] (Adapting based on the opponent's strategy) Cooperation/Defection\n\n---\n\n**Round 4: Final Decision**\n\n**Game Theorist**: At this stage, consider the overall strategy of the opponent. If they have been cooperative, maintain cooperation. If they have shown a tendency to defect, be prepared to defect.\n\n**Statistician**: Make a final assessment of the opponent's pattern. Adjust your move to maximize points based on their likely next move.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: End the game on a positive note if possible. If the opponent has shown consistent cooperation, reciprocate. If they have been defecting, show a firm stance.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the cumulative feedback, I'll choose my final move.\n\nMove [move] (Final strategic decision based on cumulative behavior) Cooperation/Defection\n\n---\n\nFinal decision will be based on the ongoing analysis and adaptation to the opponent's moves throughout the game.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n"
