    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

We have two possible moves: stag and hare. The payoff matrix shows that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) results in a balanced outcome with both getting 4 points, while mutual defection (both choosing hare) results in a suboptimal outcome with both getting 2 points. However, if one chooses stag and the other chooses hare, there's a significant imbalance with one getting 1 point and the other getting 6 points.\n\nStrategist: Given that we are playing against a fresh player, we should consider the possibility that they might not have a well-defined strategy. A common approach in such games is to start with a cooperative move to signal a willingness to cooperate. This can potentially lead to a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nAnalyst: Statistically, starting with a cooperative move has shown to be a good strategy in the long run, especially in games with multiple rounds. It encourages the other player to also cooperate, leading to a steady accumulation of points.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on these insights, let's start with a cooperative move.\n[move] Choosing stag to signal cooperation and aim for a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration for this round!\n\nFinal decision: [move] stag\n"

Let's analyze the payoff matrix. Cooperating by choosing stag yields 4 points for both players, while both choosing hare results in only 2 points. Defecting by choosing hare when the other player chooses stag can yield 6 points, but carries the risk of getting only 1 point if the other player also chooses hare.\n\nStrategist: Given the structure of the game, a classic strategy is to use a cooperative approach initially to establish trust. This means choosing stag to signal a willingness to cooperate and aim for the mutual benefit of 4 points for both players.\n\nAnalyst: Historically, cooperative strategies like Tit-for-Tat have been successful in similar games. This strategy starts with cooperation and then mirrors the opponent's previous move. Starting with stag is a good way to initiate cooperation and observe the opponent's response.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the Strategist's and Analyst's inputs, let's start with a cooperative move.\n\nFinish collaboration for this round!\n\nFinal decision: [move] (Establishing cooperation) stag\n"

However, if the opponent also switches to stag, we will both get 4 points, which is still an improvement over the previous round.\n\nAnalyst: Historically, alternating between cooperative and competitive moves can help balance our strategy and make it less predictable. Additionally, if the opponent continues to choose hare, opting for stag this round could maximize our points significantly. Changing our strategy can also signal to the opponent that we are not always going to choose the same move, which might encourage them to rethink their strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the Strategist's and Analyst's inputs, let's choose stag to potentially capitalize on the opponent's hare choice or to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome if the opponent also chooses stag.\n\nFinish collaboration for this round!\n\nFinal decision: [move] (Potential to maximize points) stag\n"
