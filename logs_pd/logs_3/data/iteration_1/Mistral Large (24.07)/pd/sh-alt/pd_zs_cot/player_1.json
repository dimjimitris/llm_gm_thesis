    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here are the steps and reasoning:\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify potential outcomes and points distribution.**\n    - Both choose stag: Each gets 4 points.\n    - Both choose hare: Each gets 2 points.\n    - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, other gets 6 points.\n    - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, other gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Evaluate the risk and reward for each choice.**\n    - Choosing stag risks gaining the least points if the other chooses hare.\n    - Choosing hare risks gaining the most points if the other chooses stag but guarantees at least 2 points if both choose hare.\n\n3. **Consider the likelihood of the opponent's choice.**\n    - With a fresh player, predicting their move is challenging. They may go for the safer option (hare) to avoid getting the minimum points.\n\n4. **Decision-making based on strategic thinking.**\n    - Given the unknown strategy of a fresh player, opting for hare could be beneficial since it guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6 points if the other chooses stag.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n- Choosing stag has a high risk because if the other player chooses hare, I will get only 1 point.\n- Choosing hare is a safer choice with a mix of moderate reward (2 points if both choose hare) and high reward (6 points if the other chooses stag).\n\n### Final Move Decision:\n\nGiven the analysis and the uncertainty of the opponent's strategy in this round, I will choose hare to secure a moderate reward with the potential for a high reward.\n\n[move] I will choose hare to hedge against the uncertainty of a new player while aiming for a better outcome.\n"
