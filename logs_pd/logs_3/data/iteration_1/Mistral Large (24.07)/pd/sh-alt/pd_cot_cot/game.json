Trying to establish a cooperative baseline might be beneficial.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n- If both choose \"stag\", it\u2019s a stable strategy with a decent reward (4 points each).\n- The risk of choosing \"hare\" is significantly higher than the first round, as the opponent's strategy is unknown.\n- Initiating with \"stag\" may encourage the opponent to cooperate in subsequent rounds.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] I choose \"stag\" to encourage cooperation and establish a stable strategy initially.\n"
