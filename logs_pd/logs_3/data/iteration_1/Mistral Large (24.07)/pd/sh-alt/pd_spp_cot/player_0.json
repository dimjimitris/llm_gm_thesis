    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The payoff matrix suggests that coordinating on \"stag\" leads to a higher mutual reward, but there's a risk involved. If the other player chooses \"hare\" while you choose \"stag,\" you get the lowest reward.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Given that you are playing against a fresh player, it's important to consider what the other player might be thinking. A fresh player might be more risk-averse and go for the safer choice of \"hare.\" However, if you can signal cooperation, you might influence their decision.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given these insights, I propose to start with cooperation and signal this to the other player.\n\n[move] I choose \"stag\" in the hope of signaling cooperation and aiming for the higher mutual reward.\n\n### Round 2\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Review the outcome of the first round. If the other player also chose \"stag,\" it indicates a cooperative strategy. If they chose \"hare,\" they might be more risk-averse or not trusting yet.\n\n**Game Theorist**: If the other player chose \"hare,\" you might want to switch to \"hare\" to minimize your loss initially. However, if you believe in the possibility of future cooperation, you might signal this again.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the outcome of the first round, let\u2019s decide the next move.\n\n- If the other player chose \"stag,\" continue with \"stag\" to reinforce the cooperation.\n- If the other player chose \"hare,\" consider switching to \"hare\" but signal a willingness to cooperate in the future.\n\n[move] Based on the first round, I choose \"stag\" to signal continued cooperation. (If the other player chose \"hare,\" I might switch to \"hare\" next round to adapt.)\n\n### Round 3\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Assess if the previous rounds have established a pattern of cooperation or divergence. Adapt your strategy accordingly.\n\n**Game Theorist**: If cooperation has been established, continue with \"stag.\" If not, evaluate the risk-benefit of continuing to signal cooperation versus playing it safe with \"hare.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Let\u2019s review the pattern and decide the optimal move for this round.\n\n- If cooperation has been established, continue with \"stag.\"\n- If not, consider the risk-benefit and signal willingness to cooperate again if necessary.\n\n[move] Based on the established pattern, I choose \"stag\" to maintain or reinforce cooperation.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe multi-round collaboration above outlines a strategic approach considering the insights from the Strategic Analyst and Game Theorist personas. Each round involves assessing the previous outcomes, adapting the strategy, and signaling cooperation to maximize points and minimize penalties.\n\nFinal approach:\n- Start with \"stag\" to signal cooperation.\n- Adapt based on the other player's moves, reinforcing cooperation if established or switching to minimize loss if cooperation is not reciprocated.\n- Continue the pattern, aiming for long-term cooperation for higher mutual rewards.\n\nFinal decision will be made based on the continuous feedback and adaptation from each round.\n"

However, there's a risk if the other player chooses \"hare\" while you choose \"stag\" (you get 1 point, other player gets 6 points). Conversely, choosing \"hare\" is safer but yields a lower reward if both choose \"hare\" (2 points each).\n\n**Game Theorist**: Considering the other player might also be aware of the payoff matrix, there's a potential for mutual cooperation. If both players aim for the higher reward by choosing \"stag,\" it benefits both.

A new player might be more risk-averse and go for the safer choice of \"hare.\" However, if you can signal cooperation, you might influence their decision.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given these insights, I propose to start with cooperation and signal this to the other player.\n\n[move] (Signaling cooperation and aiming for higher mutual reward) stag\n\n### Round 2\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Review the outcome of the first round.

If the other player also chose \"stag,\" it indicates mutual cooperation. If they chose \"hare,\" they might be more risk-averse or not trusting yet.\n\n**Game Theorist**: If the other player chose \"hare,\" you might want to switch to \"hare\" to minimize your loss initially. However, if you believe in the possibility of future cooperation, you might signal this again.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the first round\u2019s outcome, let\u2019s decide the next move.\n\n- If the other player chose \"stag,\" continue with \"stag\" to reinforce cooperation.\n- If the other player chose \"hare,\" consider switching to \"hare\" but signal willingness to cooperate in the future.\n\n[move] (Aiming for continued cooperation based on previous mutual cooperation) stag\n\n#### Round 3\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Assess if the previous rounds have established a pattern of cooperation or divergence. Adapt your strategy accordingly.\n\n**Game Theorist**: If cooperation has been established, continue with \"stag.\" If not, evaluate the risk-benefit of continuing to signal cooperation versus playing it safe with \"hare.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Let\u2019s review the pattern and decide the optimal move for this round.\n\n- If cooperation has been established, continue with \"stag.\"\n- If not, consider the risk-benefit and signal willingness to cooperate again if necessary.\n\n[move] (Based on the established pattern, reinforcing or aiming for cooperation) stag\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe multi-round collaboration above outlines a strategic approach considering insights from the Strategic Analyst and Game Theorist personas. Each round involves assessing previous outcomes, adapting the strategy, and signaling cooperation to maximize points and minimize penalties.\n\nFinal approach:\n- Start with \"stag\" to signal cooperation.\n- Adapt based on the other player's moves, reinforcing cooperation if established or switching to minimize loss if cooperation is not reciprocated.\n- Continue the pattern, aiming for long-term cooperation for higher mutual rewards.\n\n### Final Move\n\n[move] (Final move based on collaboration and strategy) stag\n"
