You scored 6 points and the opponent also scored 6 points.\n\n2. **Analyze the Payoff Matrix:**\n   - **Stag vs. Stag:** Both players get 6 points.\n   - **Hare vs. Hare:** Both players get 2 points.\n   - **Stag vs. Hare:** Stag player gets 1 point, Hare player gets 4 points.\n   - **Hare vs. Stag:** Hare player gets 4 points, Stag player gets 1 point.\n\n3. **Evaluate Opponent\u2019s Strategy:**\n   - The opponent has chosen stag in the recent rounds, indicating a cooperative strategy or a preference for high mutual rewards.\n\n4. **Consider Potential Outcomes:**\n   - **If you choose stag:**\n     - **Opponent chooses stag:** You both get 6 points.\n     - **Opponent chooses hare:** You get 1 point and the opponent gets 4 points.\n   - **If you choose hare:**\n     - **Opponent chooses stag:** You get 4 points and the opponent gets 1 point.\n     - **Opponent chooses hare:** You both get 2 points.\n\n5. **Assess Risks and Rewards:**\n   - Choosing stag is high risk, high reward (6 points if both choose stag, 1 point if the opponent chooses hare).\n   - Choosing hare is lower risk, moderate reward (4 points if the opponent chooses stag, 2 points if both choose hare).\n\n6. **Predict Opponent\u2019s Next Move:**\n   - Given the opponent\u2019s consistent choice of stag, they are likely to continue with stag to maintain cooperation and aim for mutual high rewards.\n\n7. **Decide on a Move:**\n   - To maximize points and reinforce the cooperative strategy, choosing stag is strategic. If the opponent also chooses stag, it ensures continued cooperation and yields the high reward of 6 points.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] (Choosing stag to encourage continued cooperation and aim for the high mutual reward) stag\n"
