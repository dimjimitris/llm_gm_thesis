They might not have a established strategy yet.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Possible Outcomes**\n- If I choose Stag and the opponent chooses Stag, we both get 6 points.\n- If I choose Hare and the opponent chooses Hare, we both get 2 points.\n- If I choose Stag and the opponent chooses Hare, I get 1 point and they get 4.\n- If I choose Hare and the opponent chooses Stag, I get 4 points and they get 1.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate a Strategy**\n- Choosing Stag has the potential for a higher reward (6 points) if the opponent also chooses Stag. However, it carries a higher risk if the opponent chooses Hare (1 point).\n- Choosing Hare has a lower reward if the opponent also chooses Hare (2 points), but it has a decent reward if the opponent chooses Stag (4 points).\n\n**Step 5: Decision**\n- Given that the opponent is a fresh player, they might be more likely to choose Stag, aiming for the higher reward. Therefore, I'll choose Hare to minimize my risk and potentially gain 4 points.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] I choose Hare to minimize risk and potentially gain 4 points.\n"
