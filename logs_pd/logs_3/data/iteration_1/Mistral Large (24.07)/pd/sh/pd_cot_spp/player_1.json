    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here, the goal is to maximize points. It seems like choosing \"stag\" provides a higher reward if both players choose it (6 points each), but if the other player chooses \"hare,\" you only get 1 point.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Considering the risks, choosing \"hare\" seems safer since the worst-case scenario is 2 points, and the best case is 4 points if the other player chooses \"stag.\" However, choosing \"stag\" presents a high risk-high reward situation.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Based on the initial analysis, should we lean towards a safer strategy by choosing \"hare\" or take a risk with \"stag\"? Let's discuss the first move.\n\n**Game Strategist:** Given that the other player is a fresh player, they might be more conservative and choose \"hare.\" If that's the case, choosing \"stag\" could be advantageous since you would get 4 points.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** While that's a valid point, starting with \"hare\" ensures at least 2 points, which is better than the potential 1 point if you choose \"stag\" and the other player also chooses \"hare.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Understood. Based on the initial round and to minimize risk, I'll start with a move of \"hare.\"\n\n**Move message:**\n[move] To minimize risk and ensure at least 2 points, I will start with \"hare.\"\nhare\n\n### Intermediary Analysis and Next Steps:\n\n**Game Strategist:** Good move. Let's observe the other player's response. Depending on their move, we can adjust our strategy for future rounds.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Yes, this move will give us a baseline to understand the other player's strategy, whether they are aggressive or conservative.\n\n### Waiting for the other player's move...\n\n[Receive the other player's move here]\n\n### Continue Collaboration after Other Player's Move:\n\n**Game Strategist:** Based on the other player's move, let's analyze and adjust our strategy.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** We should consider the points we've achieved and the risk for the next round.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Let's proceed with our analysis and decide on the next move based on the feedback received.\n\n### Example Collaboration After Receiving Other Player's Move:\n\n**Game Strategist:** If the other player chose \"hare,\" we both get 2 points. It shows they might be conservative. We can take a risk next and choose \"stag\" for higher potential points.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Agreed. The risk of getting 1 point is balanced by the higher potential reward of 6 points if the other player also changes to \"stag.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Alright, for the next move, I'll choose \"stag.\"\n\n**Move message:**\n[move] Based on the other player's move, I will take a risk and choose \"stag\" for a higher potential reward.\nstag\n\n### Continue this collaborative process until a final decision is made or the game ends.\n"
