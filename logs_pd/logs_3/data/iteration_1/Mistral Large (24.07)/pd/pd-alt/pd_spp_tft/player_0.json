    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Given the first round and the possibility of establishing trust, I'll start with cooperation.\n\n**[move] Cooperate. Establishing trust and potentially encouraging future cooperation.**\n\n---\n\n### Round 2 and Further Rounds\n\n#### Strategic Analyst:\n- If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, continue to cooperate to maintain the mutual benefit.\n- If the opponent defected, consider defecting to avoid being exploited but be aware of potential revenge strategies.\n- Adopting a tit-for-tat strategy can be effective, where you mirror the opponent's previous move.\n\n#### Psychology Expert:\n- If the opponent cooperated, continuing to cooperate reinforces positive behavior.\n- If the opponent defected, retaliating with defection can signal disapproval and might encourage future cooperation.\n- Be consistent but adaptable to changes in the opponent's behavior.\n\n#### AI Assistant (you):\nBased on the feedback from the first round:\n- If the opponent cooperated: **[move] Cooperate. Continuing with cooperation to maintain mutual benefit.**\n- If the opponent defected: **[move] Defect. Signaling disapproval and encouraging future cooperation.**\n\n---\n\n### Subsequent Rounds\n\n#### Strategic Analyst:\n- Continue to monitor the opponent's actions.\n- Adapt to patterns and adjust the strategy as needed.\n- Consider mixing strategies occasionally to keep the opponent guessing.\n\n#### Psychology Expert:\n- Sustained cooperation from the opponent suggests a cooperative strategy; continue cooperation.\n- Repeated defection by the opponent suggests no room for cooperation; consider defecting consistently as a defensive measure.\n- Be aware of changes in the opponent's behavior that might signal a shift in strategy.\n\n#### AI Assistant (you):\nBased on continued analysis and the opponent's actions:\n- If the opponent's behavior is consistent with cooperation: **[move] Cooperate. Maintaining the cooperative strategy.**\n- If the opponent defects: **[move] Defect. Adapting to the opponent's behavior and signaling a strategic shift.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary\nThe collaborative process involves continuous analysis and adaptation based on strategic and psychological insights. The final decision for each move will depend on the opponent's actions in previous rounds, fostering a dynamic and adaptive strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n"
