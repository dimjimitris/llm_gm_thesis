This could mean they are new to the game and might not have a set strategy.\n\n3. **Consider Possible Outcomes:**\n   - If I cooperate and the other player cooperates, we both get a decent number of points (6).\n   - If I defect and the other player cooperates, I get the highest possible points (4).\n   - However, if I defect and the other player also defects, we both get a low number of points (2).\n\n4. **Formulate a Strategy:**\n   - Given that the other player is fresh, there's a chance they might choose to cooperate.\n   - If I defect, I could potentially get the highest points (4) if the other player cooperates. However, if the other player also defects, we both get low points (2).\n   - If I cooperate, I might encourage the other player to cooperate in future rounds, leading to a mutually beneficial outcome (6 points each).\n\n5. **Decide on a Move:**\n   - For the first round, I'll choose to cooperate to signal a willingness to work together for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] I choose to cooperate to encourage a mutually beneficial strategy.
