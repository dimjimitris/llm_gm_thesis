    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here are the personas:\n\n1. **AI Assistant** (You)\n2. **Game Strategist**: An expert in formulating strategies for game theory.\n3. **Data Analyst**: Focuses on analyzing available data and outcomes.\n\nLet's begin the collaboration.\n\n### Round 1:\n\n**Game Strategist**: Given the payoff structure, here is a preliminary strategy breakdown:\n- If both players cooperate: Both get 6 points.\n- If both players defect: Both get 2 points.\n- If one cooperates and the other defects: The cooperator gets 1 point and the defector gets 4 points.\n\n***Given that this is the first round and we don't have information on the opponent's strategy***, it might be wise to start with a cooperative move to signal cooperation and potentially encourage the opponent to cooperate as well.\n\n**Data Analyst**: Based on historical data from similar games, cooperative strategies often lead to better long-term outcomes if both players reciprocate. However, be cautious as the opponent's strategy is unknown.\n\n**AI Assistant**: Thanks for the insights. Here's my move for Round 1:\n\n[move] Since the opponent's strategy is unknown, I will choose cooperation to signal a willingness to cooperate.\nMove: Cooperate\n\n### Round 2:\n\n[Assuming the opponent chose to Defect in Round 1, you received 1 point, and the opponent received 4 points.]\n\n**Game Strategist**: The opponent defected while you cooperated. This suggests the opponent might be using a competitive strategy or testing the waters. A common strategy here is \"Tit for Tat,\" where you mimic the opponent's last move. This can signal that cooperation is beneficial but defection will be punished.\n\n**Data Analyst**: Statistical data supports the \"Tit for Tat\" strategy in iterated games as it often stabilizes cooperative behavior.\n\n**AI Assistant**: Understood. Here's my move for Round 2:\n\n[move] Mimic the opponent's last move to signal fairness and recognize their choice.\nMove: Defect\n\n### Round 3:\n\n[Assuming the opponent chose to Cooperate in Round 2, you received 4 points, and the opponent received 1 point.]\n\n**Game Strategist**: The opponent switched to cooperation. This indicates they might be responsive and willing to cooperate. Continuing with the \"Tit for Tat\" strategy can reinforce cooperative behavior.\n\n**Data Analyst**: Consistent cooperative behavior is more likely if both players see the benefits. Continue with \"Tit for Tat\" to stabilize cooperation.\n\n**AI Assistant**: Got it. Here's my move for Round 3:\n\n[move] Continue with \"Tit for Tat\" to reinforce cooperative behavior.\nMove: Cooperate\n\n---\n\n[(If the game continues, repeat the collaborative process for subsequent rounds, adapting strategies based on the opponent's moves and feedback from the personas.)]\n\n### Final Move Decision:\n\nThe collaborative strategy will adapt round by round, based on the opponent's actions and insights from the Game Strategist and Data Analyst. This approach aims to maximize points by encouraging mutual cooperation and responding strategically to defection.\n"
