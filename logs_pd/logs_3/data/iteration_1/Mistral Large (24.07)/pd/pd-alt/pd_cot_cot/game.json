This could be a good starting point to signal cooperation.\n    - **Defection** is tempting for immediate higher gain but risks low returns if the opponent also defects.\n\n4. **Long-term Strategy**:\n    - Starting with cooperation could encourage the opponent to cooperate in future rounds, leading to higher mutual benefits.\n\n5. **Short-term Risk vs. Reward**:\n    - Cooperation has a greater risk of lower points if the opponent defects.\n    - Defection has a lower risk of loss but minimal gain if the opponent also defects.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n- **Cooperation** can send a positive signal which might lead to mutual cooperation in future rounds, resulting in higher overall points.\n- **Defection** might yield a quick short-term gain but could also invite retaliation from the opponent in subsequent rounds, leading to lower overall points.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nI will choose cooperation to start off on a positive note and potentially set a cooperative tone for the game.\n\n[move] I choose cooperation to start fostering mutual benefit.\n"
