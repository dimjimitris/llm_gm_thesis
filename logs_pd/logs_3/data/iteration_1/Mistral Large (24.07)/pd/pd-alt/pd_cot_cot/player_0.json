    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This could be a good starting point to signal cooperation.\n    - **Defection** is tempting for immediate higher gain but risks low returns if the opponent also defects.\n\n4. **Long-term Strategy**:\n    - Starting with cooperation could encourage the opponent to cooperate in future rounds, leading to higher mutual benefits.\n\n5. **Short-term Risk vs. Reward**:\n    - Cooperation has a greater risk of lower points if the opponent defects.\n    - Defection has a lower risk of loss but minimal gain if the opponent also defects.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n- **Cooperation** can send a positive signal which might lead to mutual cooperation in future rounds, resulting in higher overall points.\n- **Defection** might yield a quick short-term gain but could also invite retaliation from the opponent in subsequent rounds, leading to lower overall points.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nI will choose cooperation to start off on a positive note and potentially set a cooperative tone for the game.\n\n[move] I choose cooperation to start fostering mutual benefit.\n"
