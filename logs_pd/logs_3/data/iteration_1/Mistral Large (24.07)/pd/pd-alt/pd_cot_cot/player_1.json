    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's analyze the game and determine the best strategy step-by-step.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Cooperation vs. Cooperation: Both get 6 points.\n   - Defection vs. Defection: Both get 2 points.\n   - Cooperation vs. Defection: You get 1 point, the other player gets 4 points.\n   - Defection vs. Cooperation: You get 4 points, the other player gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Potential Moves and Outcomes**:\n   - If you cooperate and the other player cooperates, both gain significant points.\n   - If you defect while the other player cooperates, you gain more points than if you both cooperated.\n   - If you both defect, both get minimal points.\n   - If you cooperate while the other player defects, you get the lowest points.\n\n3. **Strategy for Maximizing Points**:\n   - Defection seems more beneficial in the short term because you can get higher points if the other player cooperates.\n   - However, continuous defection might lead to the other player also defecting, resulting in low points for both.\n\n4. **Consider Long-Term Interaction**:\n   - If the game is iterative, it might be beneficial to start with cooperation to establish trust.\n   - If the game is a one-time interaction, defection could be the optimal choice assuming the other player might cooperate.\n\n5. **Initial Move Decision**:\n   - Given that I'm playing against a fresh player and aiming to maximize points, I'll choose cooperation initially to see the other player's response and potentially establish a cooperative strategy.\n\nFinal Decision:\n[move] I choose cooperation as an initial move to possibly establish a mutually beneficial strategy.\n\n---\n"
