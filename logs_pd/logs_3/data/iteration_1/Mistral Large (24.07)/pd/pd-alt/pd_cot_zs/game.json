However, if both defect, you both get 2 points, which is not as good as mutual cooperation (6 points each).\n\n3. **Consider the other player's perspective**: The other player is also looking to maximize their points. They might be thinking the same way you are.\n\n4. **Decide on a strategy**: Since this is the first round with a fresh player, it might be beneficial to start with cooperation to signal a willingness to work together for mutual benefit. This could lead to a cooperative strategy from the other player in future rounds.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] I'll choose cooperation to start, hoping to establish a mutual cooperation strategy.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
