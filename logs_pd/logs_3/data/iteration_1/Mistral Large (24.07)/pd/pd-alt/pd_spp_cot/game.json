The best outcome for both players is cooperation, where both gain 6 points. The worst outcome for cooperation is when the opponent defects, resulting in 1 point for you and 4 points for the opponent. Defection can yield 4 points if the opponent cooperates but results in only 2 points if both defect.\n\n**Opponent Analyst:** Given that this is a fresh player, they might be inclined to cooperate initially to build trust. It's a common strategy in games like this to start with cooperation and adjust based on the opponent's behavior.\n\n**Point Maximizer:** Our primary goal is to maximize points. Starting with cooperation could set a positive tone and might encourage further cooperation, leading to higher overall scores.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Based on the analysis, let's start with cooperation to establish trust and potentially higher scores in subsequent rounds.\n\n**Move Message:**\n[move] Cooperation to build trust and potentially higher scores in subsequent rounds.\n\n---\n\n#### Round 2\n**[hint]** Hint message here: The fresh player chose cooperation in the last round. You both earned 6 points.\n\n**Opponent Analyst:** The fresh player cooperated, suggesting they might be open to continued cooperation. They might expect you to cooperate again, maintaining the mutual benefit.\n\n**Game Strategist:** Continuing to cooperate can solidify the trust and lead to more 6-point outcomes, which is optimal for both players.\n\n**Point Maximizer:** Cooperation has yielded high points so far. It's a sure way to continue maximizing points if the opponent reciprocates.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Let's continue with cooperation to maintain the trend of high points.\n\n**Move Message:**\n[move] Cooperation to maintain the mutual benefit and high points.\n\n---\n\n#### Round 3\n**[hint]** Hint message here: The fresh player chose cooperation again. You both earned 6 points.\n\n**Game Strategist:** Consistent cooperation seems to be working well. However, it's important to be cautious and observe any changes in the opponent's behavior.\n\n**Opponent Analyst:** The opponent continues to cooperate, indicating they might be a cooperative player. However, we should be prepared to adjust if they suddenly defect.\n\n**Point Maximizer:** Continuing with cooperation is the safest bet to maintain high scores as long as the opponent is cooperating.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Let's continue with cooperation but stay vigilant for any changes in the opponent's strategy.\n\n**Move Message:**\n[move] Cooperation to maintain the high points but staying alert for any changes.\n\n---\n\n### Continue this pattern for subsequent rounds, adjusting based on the opponent's behavior and hints received.\n\n---\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: The strategy involves starting with cooperation to build trust and encouraging the opponent to cooperate, thereby maximizing points through mutual cooperation. Adjust the strategy if the opponent changes their behavior, using the insights from the Game Strategist, Opponent Analyst, and Point Maximizer to make informed moves in each round.\n"

The best outcome for both players is cooperation, where both gain 6 points. The worst outcome for cooperation is when the opponent defects, resulting in 1 point for you and 4 points for the opponent. Defection can yield 4 points if the opponent cooperates but results in only 2 points if both defect.\n\n**Opponent Analyst:** Given that this is a fresh player, they might be inclined to cooperate initially to build trust. It's a common strategy in games like this to start with cooperation and adjust based on the opponent's behavior.\n\n**Point Maximizer:** Our primary goal is to maximize points. Starting with cooperation could set a positive tone and might encourage further cooperation, leading to higher overall scores.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Based on the analysis, let's start with cooperation to establish trust and potentially higher scores in subsequent rounds.\n\n**Move Message:**\n[move] (Initial cooperation to build trust and establish a baseline for future moves) cooperation\n"

Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.
