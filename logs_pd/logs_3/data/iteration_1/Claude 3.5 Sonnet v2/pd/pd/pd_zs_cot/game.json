The payoff matrix shows that mutual cooperation (4,4) yields better results than mutual defection (2,2). While defection against a cooperator gives the highest individual payoff (6), it risks establishing distrust and retaliation.\n\nSince this is the first interaction, I believe starting with cooperation can help establish mutual trust and potentially lead to better long-term outcomes. If the other player also cooperates, we both get a good outcome (4 points each). Even if they defect, the loss (1 point) would be a worthwhile risk to signal cooperative intentions.\n\n[move] cooperation I choose to cooperate as an opening move to signal trustworthiness and encourage mutual cooperation.\n"
