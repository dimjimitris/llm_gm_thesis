Initial move reasoning:\n   * Starting with cooperation signals willingness to work together\n   * It could encourage reciprocal cooperation from my opponent\n   * While there's risk of exploitation (getting only 1 point), the potential for establishing mutual cooperation (4 points) is worth it\n   * This approach aligns with the principle of \"starting nice\" in repeated games\n\n5.
