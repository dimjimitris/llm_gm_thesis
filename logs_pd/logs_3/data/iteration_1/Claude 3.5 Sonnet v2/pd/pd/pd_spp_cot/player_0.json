    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - Understands human behavior and cooperation dynamics\n3. Risk Analyst - Evaluates potential outcomes and their probabilities\n4. AI Assistant (me) - Coordinates the discussion and makes final decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: From a game theory perspective, this is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario. The payoff matrix shows that while defection is the dominant strategy for a single round (as it gives either 6 or 2 points vs 4 or 1 points for cooperation), mutual cooperation (4,4) is better than mutual defection (2,2) for both players.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since we're playing against a fresh player, they haven't formed any impressions of us yet. First impressions matter a lot in establishing trust. Starting with cooperation could signal good faith and potentially encourage cooperative behavior.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the outcomes:\n- If we cooperate: we get either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect)\n- If we defect: we get either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 2 points (if they defect)\nThe worst outcome from cooperation (1) is worse than the worst outcome from defection (2).\n\nPsychology Expert: However, establishing a cooperative relationship early could lead to better long-term outcomes if we play multiple rounds. The difference between mutual cooperation (4,4) and mutual defection (2,2) is significant over time.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this is the first move and we want to potentially establish a pattern of cooperation, I would recommend starting with cooperation, despite the risk.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with starting with cooperation to potentially establish mutual trust. Even though we risk getting only 1 point if they defect, the potential for establishing a pattern of mutual cooperation (4 points each) is worth the risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate to establish trust and potentially encourage mutual cooperation for better long-term outcomes.\n"

Our opponent chose cooperation in the first round, which gives us valuable information. They seem willing to engage in mutually beneficial play, as they chose the strategy that maximizes joint outcomes.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent's cooperation in round 1 suggests they're either motivated by reciprocity or understand the benefits of mutual cooperation. This positive first interaction creates momentum for continued cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that they cooperated in round 1:\n- If we continue cooperating: likely to get 4 points (based on their demonstrated behavior)\n- If we defect: could get 6 points once, but might destroy trust and lead to future defection\nThe risk-reward ratio favors maintaining cooperation at this stage.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. In iterated games, maintaining mutual cooperation often leads to the best long-term outcomes.
