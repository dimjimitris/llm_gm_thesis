Key considerations:\n   - Cooperation leads to the best mutual outcome (4,4)\n   - However, I'm vulnerable to exploitation if I cooperate and they defect (1,6)\n   - Defecting is safer as it guarantees at least 2 points\n   - But establishing mutual cooperation early could lead to better long-term outcomes\n\n4.
