Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I'll make my decision based on the payoff matrix.\n\nCooperation offers the potential for mutual benefit (4 points each) while minimizing the worst-case scenario (1 point if betrayed). While defection could yield more points (6) if the other player cooperates, it also risks leading to mutual defection (2 points each).\n\nI believe starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and allows for the possibility of establishing mutual trust. The potential reward of 4 points through mutual cooperation outweighs the risk of getting only 1 point if betrayed.\n\n[move] cooperate\n\nI choose to cooperate as my opening move to signal willingness for mutual benefit.\n"
