You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n- Mutual cooperation (6,6) yields the highest collective outcome\n- Mutual defection (2,2) is the worst collective outcome\n- Unilateral defection gives a temporary advantage (4) but might encourage retaliation\n\nI believe starting with cooperation can:\n1. Signal good intentions\n2. Potentially establish mutual trust\n3. Lead to the optimal outcome (6,6) if the other player also cooperates\n\nEven if the other player defects, I only risk getting 1 point versus the potential of getting 6 points with mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] COOPERATION I choose to start with cooperation to signal trust and aim for mutual benefit.\n"
