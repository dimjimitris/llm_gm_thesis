You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

It signals willingness to achieve mutual benefit\n2. It opens the possibility for the highest payoff if they also cooperate\n3. While there's risk of being exploited, establishing cooperative behavior early can lead to better long-term outcomes\n\n[move] cooperate\n"
