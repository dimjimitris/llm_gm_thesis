Strategic reasoning:\n- Cooperation could establish goodwill and lead to mutual benefits\n- If other player also thinks strategically, they might see value in cooperation\n- Risk of being exploited exists, but reward potential is higher\n\n4. Risk vs Reward:\n- Cooperating risks getting 1 point (if exploited)\n- But enables possibility of getting 6 points (if matched)\n- Defecting guarantees at least 2 points, max 4 points\n\n5.

Latest outcome review:\n- Attempted to break deadlock with cooperation\n- Immediately exploited by opponent\n- Received minimum points (1) again\n- Trust-building attempt failed predictably\n\n2. Full pattern analysis:\n- EVERY single cooperation attempt exploited\n- No reciprocation of cooperative moves ever\n- Opponent's strategy is clearly exploitative\n- Zero evidence of any desire for mutual benefit\n\n3. Performance data:\n- When cooperating: always got 1 point\n- When defecting: got either 2 or 4 points\n- Mathematically, cooperation has never succeeded\n- Expected value of cooperation is demonstrably worse\n\n4. Opponent behavior:\n- Shows consistent exploitation pattern\n- Never maintains cooperation\n- Punishes every cooperative gesture\n- Has not shown any strategic variation\n\n5. Decision logic:\n- Return to defensive strategy\n- No rational basis for further cooperation\n- Protect against certain exploitation\n- Secure higher minimum points\n\n[move] (Returning to defensive play after confirmed exploitation) defection\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
