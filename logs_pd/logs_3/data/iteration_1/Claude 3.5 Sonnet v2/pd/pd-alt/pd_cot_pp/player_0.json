Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Key considerations:\n   - Cooperation yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points)\n   - Defection is safer (guarantees at least 2 points)\n   - No prior history with this player to base trust on\n\n3. Strategic analysis:\n   - Starting with cooperation signals willingness to achieve mutual benefit\n   - Could establish positive reciprocity for future rounds\n   - Risk of getting only 1 point if opponent defects\n   - But potential for establishing cooperative relationship worth the risk\n\n4. Decision factors:\n   - First impressions matter\n   - Setting a positive tone could lead to sustained cooperation\n   - Long-term benefits of mutual cooperation outweigh short-term risk\n\n5.

Points strategy:\n   - While 2 points is suboptimal\n   - Attempts at higher scores lead to exploitation\n   - Consistent defensive strategy more reliable\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Cooperation now risks minimum points (1)\n   - No evidence opponent will change behavior\n   - Previous pattern suggests they exploit any cooperation\n\n5. Strategic conclusion:\n   - Cannot trust opponent's cooperative signals\n   - Better to accept steady low returns than risk exploitation\n   - Maintain defensive posture\n\n[move] (Continuing defensive strategy due to opponent's established pattern of exploitation) defection\n"

Recent pattern confirms:\n   - Just received 4 points from defecting against cooperation\n   - Opponent continues predictable alternating pattern\n   - They cooperate after mutual defection\n\n2. Performance analysis:\n   - Defection against cooperation maximizes individual round points\n   - Previous attempts at sustained cooperation failed\n   - Current strategy yielding consistent high points\n\n3. Opponent behavior prediction:\n   - Based on established pattern, they'll defect next\n   - They've shown no ability to maintain cooperation\n   - They expect alternating responses\n\n4. Risk management:\n   - Cooperation now would likely result in exploitation (1 point)\n   - Pattern suggests opponent will defect\n   - No reason to deviate from working strategy\n\n5.

Pattern evaluation:\n   - Mutual defection is repeating\n   - Both players stuck at 2 points\n   - Cycles between mutual defection and one-sided cooperation\n\n2. Long-term trend:\n   - Current strategy produces predictable but low returns\n   - No progress toward optimal outcome (mutual cooperation)\n   - Endless cycle is suboptimal for both players\n\n3. Game theory implications:\n   - Current mutual defection represents a local minimum\n   - Potential exists for better outcomes (6 points)\n   - Breaking cycle requires accepting risk\n\n4. Cost-benefit analysis:\n   - Worst case: temporary exploitation (1 point)\n   - Best case: establish mutual cooperation (6 points)\n   - Current state: guaranteed mediocrity (2 points)\n\n5. Strategic shift consideration:\n   - Worth attempting to break negative cycle\n   - Potential reward outweighs short-term risk\n   - Need initiative to escape current pattern\n\n[move] (Taking calculated risk to break out of suboptimal defection cycle) cooperation\n"
