You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since I'm playing against a fresh player, there's no prior history to base my decision on.\n\nLooking at the payoff matrix:\n- Mutual stag hunting (4,4) is the best collective outcome\n- However, choosing stag is risky as I could get exploited (1 points if other player chooses hare)\n- Choosing hare is safer but leads to suboptimal outcome if both choose it (2,2)\n- There's temptation to choose hare to potentially get 6 points\n\nSince this is the first interaction and cooperation tends to promote better long-term outcomes, I'll choose stag as a signal of willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to aim for mutual cooperation and optimal collective outcome.\n"
