Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing first move strategy:\n   * This is a fresh game with a new player\n   * No history or pattern to base decisions on\n   * The game rewards cooperation (Stag-Stag) more than mutual defection (Hare-Hare)\n\n3. Risk assessment:\n   * Choosing Stag is risky but has highest mutual benefit\n   * If other player chooses Hare while I choose Stag, I get minimum points (1)\n   * If I choose Hare, I'm guaranteed at least 2 points, possibly 6\n\n4. First move psychology:\n   * Many players tend to start cooperatively to establish trust\n   * Choosing Stag signals willingness to cooperate\n   * Starting with cooperation often leads to better long-term outcomes\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * Since it's the first move\n   * There's potential for establishing cooperative behavior\n   * The reward for mutual cooperation (4) is significant\n\n[move] Stag - I choose to start with cooperation, aiming for mutual benefit\n"

Complete game history analysis:\n   * Round 1-11 pattern shows:\n   * When I play Stag: mostly got exploited (1 point), except once (4 points)\n   * When I play Hare: either got 6 points or 2 points\n   * Last round: Hare-Hare resulted in 2 points each\n   * They seem to adapt their strategy frequently\n\n2. Recent rounds analysis:\n   * Round 9: I Stag, they Hare (I got 1)\n   * Round 10: I Hare, they Stag (I got 6)\n   * Round 11: I Hare, they Hare (I got 2)\n   * Shows they're becoming more unpredictable\n\n3. Risk assessment:\n   * Playing Stag: \n     - Could get 4 points if they cooperate\n     - Risk getting 1 point if exploited (happened often)\n   * Playing Hare:\n     - Guaranteed minimum 2 points\n     - Potential for 6 points if they play Stag\n     - Lower risk, potentially high reward\n\n4. Psychological analysis:\n   * Opponent might expect me to switch after Hare-Hare\n   * They might try to capitalize on expected strategy change\n   * They've shown tendency to switch moves after mutual Hare\n   * Previous pattern suggests they might play Stag after Hare-Hare\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * After Hare-Hare, opponent often switches to Stag\n   * Maintaining Hare would capitalize on this if pattern holds\n   * Hare remains the safer option with upside potential\n   * No compelling reason to risk Stag given history\n\n[move] Hare - Maintaining defensive strategy with potential for high payoff if opponent switches to Stag\n"
