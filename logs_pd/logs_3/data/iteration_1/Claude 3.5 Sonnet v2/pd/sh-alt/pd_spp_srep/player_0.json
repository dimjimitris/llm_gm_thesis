    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

AI Assistant (me) - For making the final decision\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, this is a classic Stag Hunt game. The two Nash equilibria are (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). (stag, stag) is the payoff-dominant equilibrium (4,4), while (hare, hare) is the risk-dominant equilibrium (2,2).\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since we're playing against a fresh player, they might be inclined to choose the safer option (hare) due to uncertainty. However, establishing cooperation early could lead to better outcomes for both players.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the outcomes:\n- If we choose stag: we get 4 points if they choose stag, 1 point if they choose hare\n- If we choose hare: we get 6 points if they choose stag, 2 points if they choose hare\nThe worst outcome with hare (2) is better than the worst outcome with stag (1).\n\nGame Theorist: While hare is safer, choosing stag could signal our willingness to cooperate and potentially establish a mutually beneficial pattern. Against a fresh player, setting this cooperative tone might be valuable.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree. Since this is the first move, choosing stag could help establish trust and lead to better long-term outcomes. Even if we get the worse outcome this round, it signals cooperative intent.\n\nAI Assistant: After considering all perspectives, I'll choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for the optimal outcome. While it's riskier, the potential for establishing a cooperative pattern is worth it.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n"

This suggests they either prioritize short-term gains or are naturally risk-averse. We need to consider whether to adapt to their strategy or maintain our cooperative stance.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The opponent has shown they're willing to exploit cooperative behavior. While we could try stag again to reinforce our cooperative intent, they might view this as naivety and continue exploiting. Psychology suggests they might stick with what worked for them (hare).\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our options given the opponent's revealed behavior:\n1. Choosing stag again:\n   - Risk getting exploited again (1 point)\n   - Small chance of them switching to stag (4 points)\n2. Choosing hare:\n   - If they stick to hare: secure 2 points\n   - If they switch to stag: get 6 points\nThe risk-reward ratio now favors hare.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree. The opponent has shown their preference for the safer, potentially exploitative strategy. While maintaining cooperation would be ideal, we need to protect our interests. Choosing hare at least guarantees us 2 points instead of risking another 1-point outcome.\n\nGame Theorist: From a game theory perspective, given the opponent's revealed preferences, switching to hare is rational. We can always return to stag in future rounds if the opponent shows signs of wanting to cooperate.\n\nAI Assistant: Given the opponent's previous choice and all the analysis, I'll adapt my strategy to protect against exploitation.\n\n[move] hare Adapting strategy based on opponent's previous non-cooperative choice.\n"

We're now in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium compared to mutual stag cooperation (4,4). Breaking out of this equilibrium requires one player to take a risk.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The pattern so far is:\nRound 1: We stag, they hare (we got 1)\nRound 2: Both hare (we got 2)\nThey've shown consistency in avoiding risk, but they might also realize we're both stuck in a suboptimal outcome.\n\nRisk Analyst: The situation has evolved:\n1. If we stick with hare:\n   - Likely to get 2 points (if they stay hare)\n   - Possible 6 points if they try stag\n2. If we switch to stag:\n   - Could get 4 points if they also switch\n   - Risk getting 1 point if they stay hare\n   - However, they've shown no indication of wanting to cooperate yet\n\nStrategic Advisor: The opponent has twice chosen the safer option. While we could try to break the cycle with stag, there's no strong indication they'll reciprocate. In fact, they might see it as another opportunity to exploit.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the opponent's revealed risk aversion and the absence of communication mechanisms, maintaining hare is the rational choice. The cost of unilaterally switching to stag (potential 1 point) outweighs the unlikely benefit of mutual cooperation.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on the opponent's consistent behavior and the risk analysis, I'll maintain the current strategy.\n\n[move] hare Maintaining defensive strategy given opponent's demonstrated preference for risk-averse plays.\n"

Three rounds have shown consistent behavior:\nRound 1: We stag, they hare (1 point)\nRound 2: Both hare (2 points)\nRound 3: Both hare (2 points)\nThis is a classic case of getting locked into the risk-dominant equilibrium.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The pattern suggests both players are now \"comfortable\" with the suboptimal but stable outcome. However, this might also be the perfect time to attempt breaking the pattern. The opponent might be expecting another hare, and their guard might be down.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider a strategic shift:\nPros of switching to stag:\n- Could break the suboptimal cycle\n- Opponent might be more willing to cooperate after establishing stability\n- Maximum downside is already known (1 point)\n\nCons of switching to stag:\n- Opponent has shown no indication of changing strategy\n- We risk getting exploited again\n- We give up guaranteed 2 points\n\nGame Theorist: This is an interesting inflection point. While the risk-dominant strategy would be to continue with hare, the potential reward of breaking out of this suboptimal equilibrium might be worth the risk. Game theory suggests that after several rounds of mutual hare, players sometimes become more open to cooperation.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I'd actually recommend trying stag now. Here's why:\n1. We've established a pattern of mutual hare, showing we're willing to play it safe\n2. The opponent might be realizing that 2 points per round is suboptimal\n3. Timing is good - after three consistent rounds, a change might be welcome\n4. Even if we fail, we've only lost 1 point instead of 2, and we can always return to hare\n\nRisk Analyst: While risky, the potential reward (4 points) versus the known risk (1 point) might be worth it at this stage, especially since we've accumulated some \"safe\" points in the previous rounds.\n\nAI Assistant: After careful consideration, I agree it's time to attempt breaking out of this suboptimal equilibrium. The potential reward outweighs the risk at this point.\n\n[move] stag Attempting to break the suboptimal equilibrium and establish mutual cooperation for better outcomes.\n"

They've exploited our cooperative attempts twice now, and shown no inclination towards mutual cooperation. This is likely their dominant strategy, not just early-game caution.\n\nRisk Analyst: The evidence is conclusive:\n- Every time we've played stag (2 times), we've been exploited\n- When we played hare, we secured 2 points\n- Opponent has chosen hare 100% of the time\n- No signs of strategic variation from opponent\nThe risk/reward analysis strongly favors returning to hare.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Attempting cooperation has cost us valuable points twice now. With such a consistent opponent, further attempts at cooperation would be unwise. We should lock in the guaranteed 2 points rather than risk another 1-point outcome.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the opponent's revealed strategy, the dominant choice is clear.

Our opponent is playing a pure hare strategy, regardless of our choices. They've shown no adaptation or interest in maximizing joint payoffs, even after experiencing multiple rounds of suboptimal (2,2) outcomes.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate one final time:\n1.
