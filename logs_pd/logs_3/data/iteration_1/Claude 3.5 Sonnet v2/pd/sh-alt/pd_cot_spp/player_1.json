    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n3. Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding player psychology and decision patterns\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic prisoner's dilemma-style game. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Mutual stag (4,4): Best collective outcome\n- Mutual hare (2,2): Sub-optimal but safe\n- Mixed choices (1,6) or (6,1): High risk-high reward potential\n\nRisk Analyst: Given this is the first round with a fresh player, we need to consider:\n1. No prior history to base decisions on\n2. Unknown if opponent is cooperative or competitive\n3. Risk spread between outcomes (worst case 1, best case 6)\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: In initial interactions, people often:\n1. Start with cooperative behavior to establish trust\n2. Are more likely to choose safer options when facing uncertainty\n3. May try to establish a positive precedent for future rounds\n\nGame Theorist: Given this analysis, choosing stag offers potential for:\n- Establishing cooperative behavior\n- Achieving optimal mutual outcome (4,4)\n- Signaling willingness to cooperate\n\nRisk Analyst: While stag has downside risk (could get 1 point), it's worth taking this calculated risk in the first round to potentially establish mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit, while accepting the calculated risk.\n"

Both players chose stag in the first round, which resulted in the optimal collective outcome (4,4). This suggests:\n1. The opponent might be cooperation-oriented\n2. They understand the benefits of mutual cooperation\n3. We've established a positive precedent\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The mutual stag choice in round 1 is significant because:\n1. It creates an implicit social contract\n2. Both players have demonstrated trust\n3. People tend to maintain behavioral patterns that were successful\n4. Breaking trust now would be seen as a betrayal\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n1. Maintaining stag:\n   - Continues the cooperative pattern\n   - Likely to result in another 4 points based on round 1\n   - Risk of getting only 1 point if opponent defects\n2. Switching to hare:\n   - Could get 6 points if opponent stays with stag\n   - Breaks trust and could damage future cooperation\n   - Might trigger retaliation in future rounds\n\nGame Theorist: Given the successful first round and the potential for continued cooperation, maintaining the stag strategy appears optimal. The expected value of continuing cooperation exceeds the potential short-term gain from defection.\n\n[move] stag Maintaining the cooperative strategy given our successful first round and the benefits of mutual trust.\n"

Both players are likely rational and seeking optimal long-term outcomes\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Two consecutive rounds of mutual stag choices indicate:\n1. Strong trust has been established\n2.
