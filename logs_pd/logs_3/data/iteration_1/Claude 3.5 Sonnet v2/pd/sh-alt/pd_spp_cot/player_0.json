    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n3. Strategic Planner - For developing optimal strategies\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The payoff matrix shows that (stag, stag) is a Nash equilibrium with the highest mutual benefit (4,4). However, (hare, hare) is also a Nash equilibrium, though with lower payoffs (2,2). The risk comes when players choose different strategies.\n\nRisk Analyst: Indeed, choosing stag has higher potential reward (4) but also higher risk - if the other player chooses hare, we only get 1 point while they get 6. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, and could yield 6 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, and this is the first move, I would recommend choosing stag for several reasons:\n1. It signals willingness to cooperate\n2. It allows for the highest mutual benefit\n3. Fresh players often start with cooperative moves\n4. Even if we lose this round, it sets up potential future cooperation\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While there is risk, the potential for establishing mutual cooperation outweighs it. Additionally, many players recognize that mutual stag hunting is the optimal long-term strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: The downside risk (1 point) exists, but the upside potential (4 points) makes it worthwhile, especially in establishing early cooperation.\n\n[move] stag I choose to hunt stag to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit.\n"

This suggests our opponent understands the benefits of cooperation and is willing to engage in mutually beneficial play.\n\nStrategic Planner: The successful cooperation in round 1 creates a strong foundation for continued cooperation. Breaking this cooperation would be suboptimal for both players. Psychology research shows that players tend to stick with successful strategies, especially when they've experienced the benefits firsthand.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk profile has actually improved compared to round 1:\n1. We have evidence that our opponent understands cooperative play\n2. They have demonstrated willingness to take the risk of choosing stag\n3. Breaking cooperation would mean sacrificing proven 4-point outcomes for uncertain gains\n\nGame Theorist: Maintaining the stag strategy is clearly optimal here. Game theory suggests that when players have established successful cooperation, deviating from it reduces long-term expected value.\n\nStrategic Planner: Agreed. Choosing stag maintains the cooperative equilibrium and reinforces trust. Breaking it now would likely lead to deteriorating outcomes in future rounds.\n\n[move] stag Maintaining cooperative strategy after successful first round.\n"
