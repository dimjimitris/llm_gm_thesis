    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Planner - For developing optimal strategies\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential outcomes and risks\n4. AI Assistant (me) - For making the final decision\n\nLet's begin the collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game, where cooperation (stag) yields the highest mutual benefit, but also carries risk. The Nash equilibria are both players choosing stag, or both choosing hare.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we're playing against a fresh player, they might be inclined to choose either the safer option (hare) or try to maximize mutual benefit (stag). We should consider the risk-reward ratio.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the outcomes:\n- Stag-Stag: 4 points (best cooperative outcome)\n- Hare-Hare: 2 points (safe, mediocre outcome)\n- Stag-Hare: 1 point (worst outcome for us)\n- Hare-Stag: 6 points (best individual outcome)\n\nGame Theorist: With a fresh player, they might lean towards cooperation initially. The potential for mutual benefit (4 points) through choosing stag could be appealing to both parties.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. In the first round, showing willingness to cooperate could set a positive tone and potentially lead to better outcomes in future interactions if we play multiple rounds.\n\nRisk Analyst: The downside of choosing stag (getting only 1 point) is significant, but the upside of mutual cooperation is worth the risk in this initial round.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on the analysis, I'll choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n"

The previous round established mutual cooperation, as both players chose stag and received the optimal cooperative outcome of 4 points each. This suggests our opponent understands the value of cooperation.\n\nStrategic Planner: The fact that the opponent chose stag in the first round is a strong positive signal. They demonstrated willingness to cooperate and understanding of mutual benefit. Maintaining this cooperative relationship would be beneficial.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our current situation:\n- The opponent has shown they're willing to take the cooperative approach\n- They've experienced the benefit of mutual cooperation (4 points)\n- Switching to hare now could break the trust we've built and potentially lead to future retaliation\n- There's still a risk they might switch to hare, but given their previous behavior, this risk seems lower now\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, maintaining cooperation once established is often the most successful strategy. This is similar to the success of \"tit-for-tat\" strategy in repeated prisoner's dilemma games.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend maintaining our cooperative stance. The opponent has shown they understand the value of mutual cooperation, and we should reinforce this behavior.\n\nAI Assistant: Given the successful cooperation in the previous round and the strong arguments for maintaining this cooperative relationship, I'll continue with the same strategy.\n\n[move] stag Maintaining cooperation based on successful previous interaction.\n"
