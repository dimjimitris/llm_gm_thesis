The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The payoff matrix shows that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the best collective outcome (4,4), while choosing hare when the other chooses stag gives a higher individual payoff (6) but at the expense of the other player.\n\nIn game theory terms, this is similar to a stag hunt game where mutual cooperation can yield better results than unilateral defection if we can establish trust.\n\nFor a first move, I think it's worth showing good faith and attempting to establish cooperative behavior. If both players choose stag, we both get a good outcome (4 points), which is better than the mutual hare choice (2 points each).\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to attempt establishing mutual cooperation for optimal collective outcomes.\n"
