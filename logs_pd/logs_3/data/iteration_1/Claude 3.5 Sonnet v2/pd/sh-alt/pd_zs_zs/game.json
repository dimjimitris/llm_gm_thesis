In such cases, I believe it's generally better to start with a cooperative approach to potentially establish mutual trust, even though it carries some risk.\n\nThe potential reward of mutual cooperation (4 points) is significant compared to the safer but lower payoff of choosing \"hare\" (2 points if mutual, 6 points if I get lucky).\n\n[move] stag I choose to start with cooperation, aiming for mutual benefit.\n"
