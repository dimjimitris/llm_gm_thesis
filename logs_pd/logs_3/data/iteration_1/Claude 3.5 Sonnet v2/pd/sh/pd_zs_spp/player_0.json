In this game (also known as a Stag Hunt), there are two Nash equilibria - both players choosing stag, or both choosing hare. \n\nThe stag strategy offers the highest potential reward (6 points) if both players cooperate, but comes with risk if the other player chooses hare (only 1 point). The hare strategy is safer, guaranteeing at least 2 points, with potential for 4 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\nSince this is a fresh start with a new player, I'll try to establish mutual cooperation by choosing stag.
