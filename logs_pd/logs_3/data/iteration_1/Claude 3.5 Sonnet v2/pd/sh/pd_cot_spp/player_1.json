    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Advisor - For practical decision-making and risk assessment\n3. Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding player psychology and cooperation dynamics\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- (Stag, Stag): (6,6) - Pareto optimal outcome\n- (Hare, Hare): (2,2) - Risk-dominant outcome\n- (Stag, Hare): (1,4)\n- (Hare, Stag): (4,1)\n\nStrategic Advisor: This is a coordination game where mutual cooperation (Stag) gives the highest payoff, but also carries risk. Against a fresh player, we need to consider both the potential for cooperation and risk mitigation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first interaction, the other player has no prior experience or biases. Research shows that many players tend to choose cooperation (Stag) in the first round, hoping to establish a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nGame Theorist: While choosing Hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 2 points), choosing Stag offers the potential for the highest payoff (6 points) and signals willingness to cooperate.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given that this is the first round and we want to encourage cooperation, I recommend choosing Stag. This maximizes our potential gain while also setting a positive precedent for cooperation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Starting with Stag sends a positive signal and could lead to better outcomes in future interactions if we play multiple rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate and hunt the stag, aiming for mutual benefit and signaling willingness to coordinate for optimal outcomes.\n"

Both players chose stag in the first round, establishing a cooperative precedent. This successful coordination suggests the other player is rational and understands the benefits of cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: The previous round resulted in the Pareto optimal outcome (6,6). When players have successfully coordinated on stag once, they often continue this pattern as it's mutually beneficial. This is especially true since both players now know the other is willing to cooperate.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The other player has demonstrated their willingness to take the risk for mutual benefit. Given this established trust, continuing with stag is the rational choice. Breaking the cooperation pattern would be suboptimal as:\n1. It would only yield 4 points instead of 6\n2. It might break trust and lead to worse outcomes in future rounds\n3. The other player has shown they understand the value of cooperation\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Maintaining the cooperative equilibrium is crucial. Any deviation might be interpreted as hostile and could trigger a shift to the less beneficial hare-hare equilibrium in future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: The history of successful cooperation reduces the strategic uncertainty that was present in the first round. Sticking with stag is the optimal choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Maintaining the established cooperative strategy since both players demonstrated willingness to coordinate for optimal outcomes in the previous round.\n"

Both players have demonstrated consistent rational behavior by choosing the cooperative strategy. Breaking this pattern would be psychologically jarring and likely counterproductive.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze our options:\n1. Continuing with Stag:\n   - Maintains the proven successful strategy\n   - Keeps the trust-based relationship intact\n   - Continues to yield maximum payoff (6 points)\n2.

Both players have demonstrated they understand this is the optimal strategy. There's no game theoretical reason to deviate.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The pattern is now well-established. Humans tend to stick with strategies that have proven successful, and there's no indication our opponent would deviate from this beneficial pattern.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The clear recommendation is to maintain our successful strategy of choosing Stag.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Continuing the established mutually beneficial strategy that has proven successful in both previous rounds.\n"

Three consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation indicate:\n1. High mutual trust\n2. Shared understanding of optimal strategy\n3. Both players are rational and consistent decision-makers\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's evaluate the situation:\n- Current strategy is yielding maximum possible points (18 points over 3 rounds)\n- Both players have demonstrated unwavering commitment to cooperation\n- No signs of erratic behavior or attempted exploitation\n- Changing strategy would mean:\n  * Lower expected payoff\n  * Destruction of established trust\n  * Risk of triggering a less favorable equilibrium\n\nGame Theorist: Given the perfect coordination history, the expected value of continuing with Stag is significantly higher than any alternative strategy.
