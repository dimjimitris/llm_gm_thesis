Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Considering the situation:\n   * This is a new game against a fresh player\n   * No prior history to base decisions on\n   * This is a classic coordination game\n\n3.

Decision factors:\n   * Without prior history, there's no reason to assume bad faith\n   * The potential reward for mutual stag (6) is significantly higher than mutual hare (2)\n   * Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n\n5.

Complete game history:\n   * Round 1: I stag, they hare (1 point)\n   * Round 2: I hare, they stag (4 points)\n   * Round 3: Both hare (2 points)\n   * Round 4: I stag, they hare (1 point)\n   * Round 5: I hare, they stag (4 points)\n   * Rounds 6-9: Both hare (2 points each)\n   * Round 10: I stag, they hare (1 point)\n   * Round 11: I hare, they stag (4 points)\n\n2. Pattern recognition:\n   * Every time I play stag, they play hare\n   * After I get punished with stag, they play stag\n   * After they play stag, they tend to switch back to hare\n   * This pattern has been remarkably consistent\n\n3. Predictive analysis:\n   * Based on established pattern:\n      - They just played stag\n      - They are highly likely to play hare next\n      - This has been true throughout the game\n      - No reason to expect pattern change\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   * If they play hare (likely):\n      - My stag would get 1 point\n      - My hare would get 2 points\n   * If they play stag (unlikely):\n      - My stag would get 6 points\n      - My hare would get 4 points\n   * Hare is better in likely scenario and still good in unlikely one\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   * Choose hare because:\n      - Protects against likely hare play by opponent\n      - Pattern suggests they will definitely play hare\n      - Minimizes risk while maintaining good scoring potential\n      - Continues proven successful strategy\n\n[move] hare Following predicted pattern for optimal outcome\n"

Pattern confirmation:\n   * Opponent's behavior is highly predictable\n   * They exploit every stag attempt\n   * They play stag after punishing stag\n   * They return to hare after playing stag\n   * This pattern has remained consistent throughout\n\n3. Statistical analysis:\n   * My stag moves average: 1.0 points (3 attempts)\n   * My hare moves average: 2.67 points (9 attempts)\n   * Hare has been consistently more profitable\n   * No successful cooperation has occurred\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   * We just had mutual hare\n   * Based on pattern, they're unlikely to switch to stag\n   * Attempting stag has always resulted in minimum points\n   * No indication opponent will ever cooperate\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   * Continue with hare because:\n      - It's the mathematically superior choice\n      - Pattern suggests opponent will play hare\n      - No rational basis for attempting cooperation\n      - Consistent moderate returns are better than risking minimum\n\n[move] hare Maintaining optimal defensive strategy based on established patterns\n"
