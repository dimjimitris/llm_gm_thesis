Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Key considerations:\n   - Stag gives highest mutual benefit (6 points)\n   - But stag is risky - if other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n   - Hare is safer - guarantees at least 2 points, possible 4 points\n\n4. Since this is the first round:\n   - No prior history to base decisions on\n   - Fresh player might be cooperative\n   - Maximum mutual benefit possible with stag\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   - Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate\n   - Could establish beneficial mutual cooperation\n   - Worth the risk for potential high reward\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to pursue maximum mutual benefit and signal cooperative intent.\n"

Points pattern review:\n   - My stag moves usually result in 1 point (exploitation)\n   - My hare moves result in either 4 points (when they stag) or 2 points (when matched)\n   - Hare has consistently provided better average returns\n   - Cooperation attempts have always led to exploitation\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Continuing stag has repeatedly proven costly\n   - Opponent has shown a consistent pattern of betrayal\n   - They've demonstrated they won't maintain cooperation\n   - Trying for cooperation again would be naive\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   - Must adapt to opponent's demonstrated behavior\n   - Cannot trust any signals of cooperation\n   - Need to protect against consistent exploitation\n   - Hare provides better average outcomes\n   - Time to prioritize consistent returns over optimal but unrealistic cooperation\n\n[move] hare I switch to hare to protect against exploitation and secure more reliable returns.\n"

Deeper pattern analysis:\n   - When I play stag after success, they play hare\n   - When I play hare defensively, they play stag\n   - They seem to be using a \"counter last move\" strategy\n   - This suggests they're likely to play hare this round\n\n3. Point optimization:\n   - Playing their predicted counter has been costly\n   - Need to think one step ahead of their counter-strategy\n   - If they expect me to maintain hare, they'll play hare\n   - If they play hare, stag would give me 1 point\n   - If they predict I'll switch and play stag, hare gives me 4 points\n\n4. Strategic consideration:\n   - Opponent has shown they're strategic\n   - They might anticipate me breaking the pattern\n   - However, their counter-strategy has been very consistent\n   - Breaking my own pattern has been costly\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   - Opponent's counter-strategy is predictable\n   - They will likely play hare expecting me to maintain hare\n   - Maintaining hare would result in 2 points (if they play hare)\n   - While this isn't optimal, it's better than risking 1 point\n   - Better to accept a moderate but safer outcome\n\n[move] hare I maintain hare to secure at least moderate points and avoid the risk of minimal returns.\n"

Pattern analysis from previous hare-hare situations:\n   - After Round 5 hare-hare \u2192 led to stag-stag cooperation (Round 6)\n   - After Round 9 hare-hare \u2192 led to stag-stag cooperation (Round 10)\n   - Both times, switching to stag after hare-hare led to mutual cooperation\n   - However, cooperation was always followed by betrayal\n\n3. Risk assessment:\n   - Historical evidence suggests opponent might match stag after hare-hare\n   - But they've also shown they never maintain cooperation\n   - Previous attempts at breaking hare-hare deadlock worked initially\n   - Yet led to exploitation in subsequent rounds\n\n4. Current game state:\n   - We're in a suboptimal but stable state (2 points each)\n   - Previous pattern suggests opportunity for cooperation\n   - However, opponent has consistently shown they exploit after cooperation\n   - The risk of getting 1 point is significant\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   - While history suggests stag might work, opponent's post-cooperation betrayal is consistent\n   - The stable 2 points from hare is better than risking 1 point\n   - Breaking from hare now would be predictable based on game history\n   - Better to maintain defensive position than risk exploitation\n   - Accept consistent moderate returns over risky optimal returns\n\n[move] hare I maintain hare to secure consistent returns rather than risk exploitation based on opponent's established pattern of post-cooperation betrayal.\n"

Opponent's latest behavioral pattern:\n   - They've broken their previous pattern of matching hare-hare\n   - Instead of staying with hare, they switched to stag\n   - This could indicate:\n   * They're trying to bait me into playing stag\n   * They're attempting a new strategy\n   * They're becoming more aggressive with stag plays\n\n3. Point analysis:\n   - Recent hare plays have given me:\n   * 4 points when opponent plays stag\n   * 2 points when opponent plays hare\n   - No recent stag plays, but historically they led to:\n   * Either 6 points (rare cooperation)\n   * Or 1 point (frequent exploitation)\n\n4.

Pattern evolution:\n   - Previously, hare-hare situations led to stag-stag cooperation\n   - However, opponent has changed their strategy\n   - They're now mixing between stag and hare responses\n   - No longer following their earlier patterns\n   - This suggests they're adapting their strategy\n\n3.
