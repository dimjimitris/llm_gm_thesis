The payoff matrix shows that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest total points (6 each), while choosing different moves creates an imbalance.\n\nWhile choosing hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 2 points), choosing stag has the potential for the highest payoff if the other player also cooperates. In first interactions, it's often beneficial to signal willingness to cooperate.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperative intent and aim for mutual benefit.\n"
