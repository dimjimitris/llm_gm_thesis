Consider the risk/reward:\n   - Stag has highest potential payoff (6) but also highest risk (could get only 1)\n   - Hare is safer (guaranteed minimum of 2, potential for 4)\n\n3. Since this is a fresh player:\n   - No prior history to base decisions on\n   - They might be inclined to cooperate initially\n   - Starting with cooperation could establish mutual trust\n\n4. Strategic consideration:\n   - Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate\n   - Could lead to better long-term outcomes if other player reciprocates\n   - Risk is worth the potential reward in first round\n\n5.
