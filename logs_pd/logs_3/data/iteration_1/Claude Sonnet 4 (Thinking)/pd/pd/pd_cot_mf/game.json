They've been consistently defecting since\n\nThis suggests they might be willing to cooperate if they felt safe, but they're being very defensive right now.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. We're in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium. Someone needs to take a risk to break out of it. The question is whether my opponent might be thinking the same thing.\n\nGiven that we've been defecting for 3 rounds straight now, they might be starting to consider that mutual cooperation would be better. Or they might be completely locked into defensive mode.\n\nI think I should continue with defection because:\n1. My opponent just exploited cooperation when I tried it\n2.

Analyze the comprehensive 15-round history:\n   - Round 1: I defected, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 6, they got 1\n   - Rounds 2-15: Opponent has defected 14 consecutive times with perfect consistency\n   - My cooperation attempts (rounds 3 & 7): Both immediately exploited for 1 point each\n   - Current: 12 consecutive mutual defection rounds yielding 2 points each\n\n2. Evaluate opponent's statistically proven strategy:\n   - 14/14 perfect defection streak since round 1 (absolute mathematical consistency)\n   - 2/2 perfect exploitation of cooperation attempts (100% punishment rate)\n   - Zero cooperation signals across 14 consecutive opportunities\n   - Mathematically proven permanent \"always defect\" strategy\n\n3. Assess the statistical certainty:\n   - 14 consecutive defections constitute overwhelming statistical evidence\n   - Opponent's behavior is predictable with near-mathematical certainty\n   - They've consistently chosen guaranteed points over mutual benefit\n   - Their strategy shows zero variation across extensive data sample\n\n4. Calculate statistically certain outcomes:\n   - Cooperation: Statistically certain 1 point (perfect exploitation record over 14 rounds)\n   - Defection: Statistically certain 2 points (established mutual equilibrium)\n   - Probability of opponent cooperation: Statistically negligible (14 consecutive defections)\n\n5. Mathematically optimal decision:\n   - Continue statistically proven defensive strategy\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: With 14 consecutive opponent defections and perfect exploitation history, defection is the statistically optimal choice for guaranteed 2 points.\n\n[move] defection",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
