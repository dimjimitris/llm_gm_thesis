However, if this is a repeated game, mutual cooperation (4-4) is better for both players than mutual defection (2-2).\n\nI should consider: is this player trying to establish trust? If I cooperate this round and they cooperate back, we could both benefit more in future rounds.\n\nBut there's also the risk they're setting me up - cooperate once to see if I'll cooperate, then defect to get 6 points.\n\nGiven that they just cooperated when I defected, I think I should try cooperating to see if we can establish mutual cooperation.",
