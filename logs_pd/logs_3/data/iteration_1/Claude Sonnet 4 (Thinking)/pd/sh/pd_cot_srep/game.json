      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze this pattern:\n\nRound 15: I chose hare, they chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n\nThis follows their pattern:\n- After periods of mutual hare, they occasionally test with stag\n- Round 10: I hare, they stag (I got 4, they got 1) \n- Round 12: I hare, they stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n- Round 15: I hare, they stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n\nSo they've now tried stag and gotten punished 4 times total.\n\nTheir pattern seems to be:\n1. They exploit my stag moves consistently (3 times)\n2. When we're in mutual hare periods, they occasionally test with stag\n3. But they keep getting punished when they try stag\n\nGiven that they just got punished again with stag, they'll likely revert to hare next round based on their past behavior.\n\nLet me think about their next move:\n- They just got 1 point from choosing stag\n- History shows after getting punished with stag, they tend to go back to defensive hare\n- They might try stag again if they think I'll finally coordinate, but that's less likely given how often they've been burned\n\nMy options:\n- If they choose hare (likely): Hare gives me 2, Stag gives me 1\n- If they choose stag: Hare gives me 4, Stag gives me 6\n\nGiven their pattern of reverting to hare after being punished with stag, I should stick with hare to protect myself.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
