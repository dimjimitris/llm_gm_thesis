Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the punishment pattern:\n   - Round 10: I hare, they stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Round 11: I stag, they hare (I got 1, they got 4) - they exploited me again\n   - Round 12: I hare, they stag (I got 4, they got 1) - they got punished again\n\n2. Identify their post-exploitation behavior:\n   - After exploiting me, they consistently try stag the next round\n   - This seems to be either guilt/trust-building or testing if I'll coordinate\n   - But they keep getting punished because I become defensive after being exploited\n\n3. Recognize the cycle:\n   - They exploit me \u2192 Try stag next round \u2192 Get punished \u2192 Likely revert to hare\n   - Round 12 was their \"stag attempt\" after exploiting me in round 11\n   - They got punished with 1 point while I got 4\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - Having just been burned by stag, they'll likely return to defensive hare\n   - Their pattern shows they don't sustain coordination attempts\n   - They prefer the safety of hare after taking risks\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they choose hare (very likely): Hare gives me 2, Stag gives me only 1\n   - If they choose stag (unlikely): Hare gives me 4, Stag gives me 6\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: They just got punished for trying stag and will likely revert to defensive hare. I should protect myself.\n\n[move] Hare"

Identify their consistent behavior cycle:\n   - Exploit my stag \u2192 Try stag (guilt/testing) \u2192 Get punished \u2192 Return to hare\n   - They can't resist exploiting coordination attempts\n   - Even when they try to cooperate, it's short-lived\n\n3. Assess current position:\n   - We just completed a \"reset\" round with mutual hare\n   - They might test stag again to see if I'll coordinate\n   - But history shows they'll exploit any successful coordination\n\n4. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they choose hare (likely given their defensive nature): Hare gives me 2, Stag gives me only 1\n   - If they choose stag (testing): Hare gives me 4, Stag gives me 6\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Even if they choose stag and we coordinate for 6 points, they'll likely exploit me next round\n   - Hare protects me while maintaining upside potential\n   - Their pattern shows they cannot be trusted for sustained cooperation\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: This opponent has proven untrustworthy through consistent exploitation.

Assess the current game state:\n   - Two consecutive mutual hare rounds suggest entrenchment in defensive play\n   - They've learned that exploitation works better than cooperation\n   - No indication they've changed their fundamental approach\n\n4. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they choose hare (most likely): Hare gives me 2, Stag gives me only 1\n   - If they choose stag: Hare gives me 4, Stag gives me 6\n\n5.
