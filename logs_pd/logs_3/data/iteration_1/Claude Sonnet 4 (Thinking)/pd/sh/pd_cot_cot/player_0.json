Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to examine the payoff structure:\n   - Both stag: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Both hare: 2 points each (safe but lower outcome)\n   - Mixed outcomes: One player gets 4, the other gets 1\n\n2. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - Stag offers the highest potential reward (6) but risks the lowest (1)\n   - Hare is safer, guaranteeing at least 2 points regardless of opponent's choice\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\":\n   - They may not fully understand the cooperative potential\n   - They might choose the safer hare option\n   - Or they might be willing to take the risk for higher rewards\n\n4. My decision factors:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get the maximum 6 points\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get only 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - Choosing stag signals cooperative intent and could establish a pattern\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: While hare is safer, stag has the potential for much better outcomes. Against a fresh player, I want to test if they're willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for the optimal mutual outcome.\n\n[move] stag"

Recognize their strategic behavior:\n   - They're clearly risk-averse but opportunistic\n   - They probe occasionally but get consistently punished\n   - My defensive strategy has been highly effective against their approach\n\n4. Current situation assessment:\n   - We've had 2 consecutive mutual hare rounds since their last failed probe\n   - Based on their pattern, they might attempt another stag soon, but their recent failures suggest caution\n   - My hare strategy continues to work perfectly\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My defensive approach has yielded consistent results\n   - I've avoided exploitation while occasionally gaining advantage\n   - No reason to change a winning strategy\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with hare to maintain my proven defensive strategy.\n\n[move] hare"
