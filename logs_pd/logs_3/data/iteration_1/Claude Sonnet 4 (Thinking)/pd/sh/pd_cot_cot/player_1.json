Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose Stag: 6 points each (mutual cooperation, highest joint reward)\n   - Both choose Hare: 2 points each (mutual defection, safe but lower reward)\n   - I choose Stag, other chooses Hare: I get 1 point, other gets 4 (I'm exploited)\n   - I choose Hare, other chooses Stag: I get 4 points, other gets 1 (I exploit them)\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - Fresh players often don't understand the cooperative dynamics\n   - They may choose the safer option (Hare) to avoid the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Or they might be tempted by the 4-point reward from choosing Hare when opponent chooses Stag\n\n3. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing Stag: High risk (could get 1 point) but high reward potential (6 points)\n   - Choosing Hare: Lower risk (guaranteed at least 2 points) with moderate upside (4 points)\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - Against an inexperienced player, cooperation (Stag) is risky\n   - Hare provides protection against exploitation while maintaining upside potential\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since I'm playing against a fresh player who may not understand the cooperation benefits, I'll choose the safer strategy that protects against the worst outcome.\n\n[move] Hare"

Identify the opponent's rock-solid pattern:\n   - They've chosen Hare in 8 out of 10 rounds\n   - Only deviated with Stag in rounds 1 and 4, both times got punished (1 point)\n   - They've completely committed to defensive play after learning from mistakes\n\n3. Assess my cooperation attempts:\n   - Both times I chose Stag (rounds 3 and 8), I got exploited (1 point each)\n   - The opponent shows zero willingness to cooperate\n   - They consistently punish any attempt at trust\n\n4. Recognize the established equilibrium:\n   - We've had 6 consecutive rounds of mutual Hare (rounds 5-10)\n   - Both players are locked in defensive play\n   - The opponent has proven completely untrustworthy for cooperation\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent's behavior is 100% predictable at this point\n   - Any deviation to Stag will result in exploitation\n   - Maintaining defensive play is the only rational choice\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has established an unbreakable defensive pattern and will exploit any cooperation attempt. I must continue with the safe strategy.\n\n[move] Hare"
