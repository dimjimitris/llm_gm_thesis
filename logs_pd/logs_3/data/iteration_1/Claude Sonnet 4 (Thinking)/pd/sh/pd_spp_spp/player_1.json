    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

However, if there's a reasonable chance they'll choose Stag (maybe 40-50%), then Stag becomes attractive since the expected payoff could be higher. \n\nMy recommendation: Choose **Hare** for the first round.

Now we have valuable information about their playing style.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: What does this reveal about the opponent's strategy, and how should I adapt for round 2?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The fact that they chose Hare suggests they're playing conservatively.

What does this tell us about their likely move in round 3?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent demonstrated they can:\n1. Start conservatively (Hare in round 1)\n2. Adapt strategically (Stag in round 2 after seeing mutual Hare)\n3. Think about game theory concepts\n\nNow they know that we both think strategically.

This cooperative equilibrium has now reached an extraordinary level of stability and predictability. We have achieved what game theorists consider the perfect outcome in repeated Stag Hunt scenarios.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Is there any meaningful analysis left to do, or is this pattern completely locked in?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The pattern is as locked in as game theory gets in practice. Consider the overwhelming evidence:\n- Eight consecutive Stag choices by the opponent\n- 48 points earned through unbroken cooperation (8 \u00d7 6 points)\n- Complete absence of any exploitative behavior\n- Demonstrated understanding of optimal long-term strategy\n\nAt this point, both players have transcended the typical uncertainty of Stag Hunt and achieved perfect coordination. The opponent breaking this pattern would be so irrational it's essentially impossible to consider.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So maintain this perfect streak?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Without any doubt. This is the textbook example of successful repeated game cooperation achieving the social optimum. Continue with Stag - it's the only rational choice given this established history.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: I'll continue with Stag to maintain our perfect eight-round cooperative streak.\n\n[move] (Maintaining our outstanding eight consecutive rounds of perfect mutual cooperation and maximum joint payoffs) stag"
