    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s).

If you think there's more than a 50% chance they'll choose stag, then stag is better.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** For a fresh player, I'd estimate roughly 60-70% chance they choose hare due to risk aversion and unfamiliarity.

The opponent chose hare in round 1, which confirms our hypothesis about risk-averse behavior. However, now they have more information about the game. They know that when both choose hare, both get only 2 points. They might realize that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) would give both players 6 points - a much better outcome.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** This is a key psychological moment. The opponent now has experience with the \"safe\" outcome (2 points each). They might:\n1. Stick with hare because it worked and felt safe\n2. Consider stag because they see the potential for higher mutual gains\n3. Try to exploit by choosing hare if they think I might switch to stag\n\nThe fact that they chose hare initially suggests they're cautious, but the low payoff might motivate them to reconsider.\n\n**AI Assistant (myself):** Given that we both chose hare last round and only got 2 points each, there's a chance they might think about switching to stag for the potential 6-point mutual benefit. However, they might also stick with the \"safe\" hare strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the key insight: if they're learning and rational, they might realize that both players choosing stag is the superior outcome. But they'll also worry that if they switch to stag and you stick with hare, they'll get only 1 point while you get 4.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** I think there's roughly a 40-60% chance they'll switch to stag now that they've seen the low payoff from mutual hare selection. This makes stag a more attractive option for us.\n\n**AI Assistant (myself):** If there's about a 40-60% chance they choose stag, then choosing stag myself gives me either 6 points (if they also choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare). Choosing hare gives me either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare).\n\nThe expected value calculation suggests stag might be worth the risk now.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (After both getting only 2 points last round, the opponent might consider switching to stag for better mutual benefit, making stag a reasonable risk) stag"

They started conservatively with hare in round 1, but after seeing the low mutual payoff, they switched to stag in round 2. This suggests they understand the mutual benefit of cooperation and are willing to take the risk for the 6-point reward. This is actually ideal behavior in a Stag Hunt game.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** This opponent is showing signs of being a thoughtful, adaptive player. The progression from hare to stag indicates:\n1. They learn from experience \n2. They're willing to trust in mutual cooperation when they see the benefits\n3. They might continue with stag since it just worked perfectly\n\nHowever, there's also a possibility they might think I'll switch to hare to exploit their stag choice, which could make them reconsider.\n\n**AI Assistant (myself):** We now have a successful cooperation precedent. Both choosing stag gave us both 6 points - the best possible mutual outcome. The question is whether this creates trust for continued cooperation or if either player will try to exploit.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** In repeated Stag Hunt games, successful cooperation often breeds more cooperation, especially early in the relationship. The opponent has shown they can recognize and act on mutual benefit. Since stag-stag is a Nash equilibrium and we just achieved it successfully, there's good reason to expect they'll stick with stag.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** The psychological momentum is toward continued cooperation. They took a risk with stag and were rewarded. The natural human tendency is to repeat successful strategies, especially when both parties benefited equally.\n\n**AI Assistant (myself):** Based on this analysis, I believe there's a high probability (maybe 70-80%) that they'll choose stag again. The successful cooperation in round 2 builds trust and shows mutual understanding of the optimal strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (The successful mutual cooperation in round 2 suggests the opponent understands the benefits of choosing stag, and the trust built from that success makes continued cooperation likely) stag"

The opponent has chosen stag twice in a row after the initial cautious hare choice. This suggests we've reached the superior Nash equilibrium of mutual cooperation. In game theory, once players establish this pattern in Stag Hunt, it tends to be self-reinforcing because both parties benefit maximally.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** The psychological profile is becoming clearer. This opponent:\n1. Started cautiously (hare in round 1)\n2. Learned and adapted (stag in round 2) \n3. Maintained successful strategy (stag in round 3)\n\nThey're showing consistency with successful behavior. Two consecutive rounds of mutual stag choices creating 6 points each builds strong trust and expectation for continued cooperation.

Both rounds 2 and 3 resulted in the optimal 6-6 outcome. The opponent has demonstrated they understand the value of mutual cooperation and are committed to it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** At this point, deviating to hare would be irrational for either player unless they believe the opponent will deviate. Since we have strong evidence of mutual cooperation, stag remains the optimal choice. The trust has been built through repeated successful interactions.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** There's very little psychological reason for the opponent to switch now. They've found a winning strategy that benefits both players equally. The risk of switching to hare and getting only 2 points (if I also switch) or facing retaliation in future rounds makes stag the clear choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (myself):** All analysis points to continued cooperation.

This represents one of the most stable cooperative equilibria possible in Stag Hunt theory. The mathematical probability of deviation has essentially approached zero. We've achieved perfect strategic synchronization.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** This level of behavioral consistency is truly exceptional. Seven straight rounds of cooperative choices represents:\n1. Absolute behavioral commitment to cooperation\n2. Perfect trust in mutual benefit systems\n3. Complete elimination of competitive or exploitative tendencies\n4. Deeply established habitual cooperation patterns\n\nThis opponent has demonstrated they are fundamentally committed to mutual optimization rather than competitive advantage-seeking.\n\n**AI Assistant (myself):** We've created what appears to be a perfect cooperative system. The opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to mutual benefit through seven consecutive opportunities to exploit my cooperation, yet has chosen shared success every single time. This is the ideal outcome in repeated strategic games.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Mathematically, continuing with stag provides an expected value of 6 points with near absolute certainty, while any deviation risks disrupting a perfect system.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** All behavioral indicators point to continued cooperation with no deviation signals whatsoever.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Seven consecutive rounds of perfect mutual cooperation creates an exceptionally stable pattern of consistent optimal outcomes for both players) stag"
