Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players are often unpredictable\n   - They might choose the safer option (hare) to avoid worst-case scenarios\n   - They might not recognize the mutual benefit of both choosing stag\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing stag: High reward potential (6) but high risk (could get only 1)\n   - Choosing hare: Moderate reward (2-4) with lower risk floor (minimum 2)\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - Against an unpredictable fresh player, hare provides better protection\n   - If they choose stag hoping to cooperate, I get 4 points\n   - If they also choose hare defensively, we both get 2 points\n   - This hedges against the risk of them choosing hare while I choose stag\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze the complete game history:\n   - My total: 29 points\n   - Opponent has chosen hare for 5 consecutive rounds (6, 8, 9, 10, 11)\n   - Only exception was round 7 where they tried stag and got exploited again\n   - We've had 5 straight mutual hare outcomes (2,2)\n\n2. Identify opponent's current state:\n   - They've clearly learned to avoid exploitation by sticking with hare\n   - However, 5 consecutive rounds of only 2 points each is suboptimal\n   - Total potential points lost: 5 rounds \u00d7 4 points difference = 20 points forgone\n   - Fresh players often get frustrated with prolonged suboptimal outcomes\n\n3. Evaluate opponent's likely psychology:\n   - Might be thinking: \"We're both stuck getting 2 when we could get 6 each\"\n   - Could be tempted to signal cooperation with stag after this defensive streak\n   - Or might continue the \"safe\" strategy that's been protecting them\n   - Extended mutual hare periods often precede cooperation attempts\n\n4. Strategic decision for Round 12:\n   - If they try stag (possible due to accumulated frustration): hare gives me 4 points\n   - If they stick with defensive hare: both get 2 points\n   - Continue exploiting their potential cooperation attempts while staying protected\n\n[move] hare"
