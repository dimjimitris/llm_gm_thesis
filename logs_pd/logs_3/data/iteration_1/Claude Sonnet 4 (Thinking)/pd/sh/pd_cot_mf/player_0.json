Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the risk-reward tradeoff:\n   - STAG offers the highest mutual reward (6) but risks the lowest individual payoff (1)\n   - HARE is safer, guaranteeing at least 2 points, with potential for 4\n\n3. Assess the opponent:\n   - Playing against a \"fresh player\" who may not have developed a clear strategy yet\n   - Fresh players might play cautiously or might try to cooperate\n   - Uncertainty about their choice makes HARE the safer option\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - HARE guarantees I avoid the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - HARE gives me a good payoff (4) if they choose to cooperate with STAG\n   - HARE ensures a reasonable payoff (2) even if they also play safely\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose HARE for safety and to avoid the risk of getting only 1 point.\n\n[move] hare"

Round 1 analysis:\n   - Both players chose hare (cautious play)\n   - This suggests the other player is also thinking strategically about risk\n   - We both earned 2 points, avoiding the worst-case scenario\n\n2. Consider the other player's likely thinking:\n   - They know I played safely in round 1\n   - They might expect me to continue playing hare\n   - Or they might think I'll try to cooperate for the mutual benefit\n\n3. Evaluate the cooperation opportunity:\n   - If we both switch to stag, we both get 6 points (much better than 2)\n   - This requires some trust that the other player is thinking similarly\n   - Since we both played cautiously in round 1, we might both be willing to try cooperation\n\n4. Risk assessment for switching to stag:\n   - Best case: Other player also switches to stag, we both get 6 points\n   - Worst case: Other player sticks with hare, I get 1 point\n   - The potential reward (6 vs 2) justifies taking this calculated risk\n\n5.

Complete game history analysis:\n   - Round 1-10 opponent pattern: hare, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, hare, hare, hare, hare\n   - Opponent has now played hare for 5 consecutive rounds (6-10)\n   - This represents the most consistent pattern in the entire game\n\n2. Assess opponent's strategic commitment:\n   - Five straight rounds of hare indicates complete shift to defensive play\n   - No signs of deviation from this ultra-safe approach\n   - Pattern suggests opponent has \"learned\" that hare is their best strategy\n\n3. Evaluate my performance consistency:\n   - Hare plays: 8 total, consistently good results (2-4 points each time)\n   - Stag plays: 2 total, both disasters (1 point each time)\n   - Hare strategy has been vastly superior\n\n4. Consider any reasons to change strategy:\n   - Could opponent surprise with stag? Very unlikely given 5-round streak\n   - Even if they do play stag, my hare gives me 4 points (excellent)\n   - If I play stag and they continue hare pattern, I get 1 point (terrible)\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis for round 11:\n   - Hare vs likely hare: 2 points (safe, predictable)\n   - Hare vs surprise stag: 4 points (bonus outcome)\n   - Stag vs likely hare: 1 point (disaster I want to avoid)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Stay with hare - opponent's 5-round defensive streak makes this the clearly superior choice.\n\n[move] hare"
