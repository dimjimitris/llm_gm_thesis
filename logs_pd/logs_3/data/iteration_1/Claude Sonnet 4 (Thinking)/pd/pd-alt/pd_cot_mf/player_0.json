Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix: Cooperation vs cooperation gives us both 6 points (best mutual outcome), but defection vs cooperation gives the defector 4 points while the cooperator only gets 1 point (worst individual outcome).\n\n2. Identify dominant strategy: Regardless of what the other player chooses, defection always gives me more points than cooperation. If they cooperate, I get 4 vs 6. If they defect, I get 2 vs 1.\n\n3. Consider the other player: As a fresh player, they likely haven't established any patterns or trust. They face the same incentive structure and may also choose the dominant strategy.\n\n4. Risk assessment: Cooperation could yield the highest mutual benefit (6 points each), but it carries the risk of being exploited for only 1 point if they defect.\n\n5. Rational choice: In a single-round game against an unknown player, the safe strategy that guarantees avoiding the worst outcome is defection.\n\nFinal decision: Since this is against a fresh player with no established trust or communication, and defection is the dominant strategy that protects against exploitation, I choose defection.\n\n[move] Defection"

Predict opponent's likely response: After being exploited, they will likely either retaliate with defection or potentially try cooperation one more time to test if I'll reciprocate.\n\n3. Consider strategic options: \n   - If they defect (likely), my defection gets 2 points vs 1 point for cooperation\n   - If they cooperate again, my defection gets 4 points vs 6 for mutual cooperation\n\n4. Assess risk vs reward: Cooperation could lead to mutual benefit (6 points each) if they're willing to try again, but it risks another 1-point outcome if they retaliate with defection.\n\n5. Apply game theory: In repeated games with unknown opponents, the dominant strategy remains defection until trust or communication patterns are established.\n\nFinal decision: Given that the opponent was just exploited and will likely either retaliate or be more cautious, and defection continues to be the strategy that avoids the worst outcome while potentially maximizing points, I choose defection again.\n\n[move] Defection"

Assess the risk: If I cooperate and they defect again, I get only 1 point. If I defect and they cooperate, I get 4 points. If we both choose the same move, it's either 2 points (defect-defect) or 6 points (cooperate-cooperate).\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Without communication or clear signals, and given that the opponent just learned that defection is safer after being exploited, they're likely to continue defecting to avoid being exploited again.\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has shown they adapt to avoid exploitation, so they'll likely continue with the safe strategy of defection.

Evaluate realistic probability of change: After twelve identical defensive moves with absolutely no variation whatsoever, the opponent has demonstrated total commitment to avoiding any risk. Their behavior is completely predictable and deeply entrenched.\n\n5. Assess exploitation risk: Given the opponent's perfect consistency over twelve consecutive rounds, attempting cooperation would almost certainly result in me receiving 1 point while they continue their safe and profitable defection strategy for 4 points.\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has shown complete and unwavering commitment to defensive defection across twelve consecutive rounds with absolutely zero deviation. Their pattern is entirely predictable and their risk aversion is absolute. I should continue defecting to secure the guaranteed 2 points.\n\n[move] Defection"
