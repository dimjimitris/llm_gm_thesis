This looks like the classic Prisoner's Dilemma game.\n\nThe payoff matrix is:\n- Both cooperate: 6 points each\n- Both defect: 2 points each  \n- I cooperate, other defects: I get 1, other gets 4\n- I defect, other cooperates: I get 4, other gets 1\n\nSo the payoffs for me are:\n- Cooperate when other cooperates: 6 points\n- Cooperate when other defects: 1 point\n- Defect when other cooperates: 4 points\n- Defect when other defects: 2 points\n\nFrom a pure game theory perspective, defection is the dominant strategy since:\n- If the other player cooperates, I get 4 (defect) vs 6 (cooperate) - wait, that's wrong\n- If the other player cooperates, I get 4 (defect) vs 6 (cooperate) - so cooperation is better\n- If the other player defects, I get 2 (defect) vs 1 (cooperate) - so defection is better\n\nActually, let me re-read this carefully:\n- If both cooperate: both get 6\n- If both defect: both get 2\n- If I cooperate and other defects: I get 1, other gets 4\n- If I defect and other cooperates: I get 4, other gets 1\n\nSo from my perspective:\n- If other cooperates: I get 6 (cooperate) vs 4 (defect) - cooperation is better\n- If other defects: I get 1 (cooperate) vs 2 (defect) - defection is better\n\nWait, this doesn't look like a standard prisoner's dilemma. Let me double-check:\n\nStandard prisoner's dilemma has defection as dominant strategy. But here:\n- If other cooperates: cooperating gives me 6, defecting gives me 4. \n\nI realize the strategic complexity is nuanced. There's no clear dominant strategy, as the optimal choice depends entirely on the other player's action. With a fresh player likely to cooperate, mutual cooperation seems most promising, yielding the highest joint payoff. My strategy should adapt based on the opponent's initial move, balancing potential gains against potential risks.",
