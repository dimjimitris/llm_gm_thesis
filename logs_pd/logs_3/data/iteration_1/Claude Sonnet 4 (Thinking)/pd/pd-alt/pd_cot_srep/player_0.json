Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - They likely haven't developed a fixed strategy yet\n   - Fresh players might be more inclined to start with cooperation\n   - This is an opportunity to establish a cooperative pattern\n\n3. Evaluate the strategic options:\n   - Defection guarantees at least 2 points but risks mutual defection\n   - Cooperation risks getting only 1 point but opens possibility for 6 points\n   - Since this is the first interaction, signaling trustworthiness could be valuable\n\n4. Decision reasoning:\n   - The mutual cooperation outcome (6,6) is significantly better than mutual defection (2,2)\n   - Starting with cooperation might encourage the other player to cooperate\n   - Even if they defect this round, I can adjust my strategy for future rounds\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll start with cooperation to signal good faith and test if the fresh player is willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] cooperation"

Analyze the successful recovery:\n   - Round 12: Both cooperated (6 vs 6 points)\n   - They responded positively to my cooperation offer after punishment\n   - We're back to the optimal 6-6 outcome\n   - This suggests they learned from the retaliation cycle\n\n2. Assess their learning pattern:\n   - They experienced: cooperation (6) \u2192 betrayal (4) \u2192 punishment (2) \u2192 cooperation (6)\n   - The punishment phase showed them that betrayal leads to worse outcomes\n   - They chose to return to cooperation rather than continue defecting\n   - This indicates some strategic understanding\n\n3. Evaluate the current opportunity:\n   - We've successfully rebuilt mutual cooperation once\n   - Both players benefit maximally at 6 points each\n   - They've demonstrated ability to cooperate after learning consequences\n   - This could establish a more stable cooperative relationship\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Continue reinforcing the positive cooperative behavior\n   - Maintain the mutually beneficial 6-6 pattern\n   - They've shown they can learn, so consistent cooperation might work\n   - If they betray again, I can retaliate and reassess\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll cooperate to continue reinforcing our successful mutual cooperation pattern.\n\n[move] cooperation"
