Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: The highest individual reward is 6 points (hare vs stag), cooperative reward is 4 points (both stag), and safe reward is 2 points (both hare).\n\n2. Consider the opponent: A \"fresh player\" suggests someone new who might be more trusting or cautious in their first game.\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing stag: Best case 4 points, worst case 1 point\n   - Choosing hare: Best case 6 points, worst case 2 points\n\n4. Strategic reasoning: Hare provides both a better worst-case outcome (2 vs 1) and the possibility of maximum points (6) if the fresh player chooses to cooperate with stag.\n\n5. Decision: Since the fresh player might be inclined to trust initially, and hare gives me better protection against the worst outcome while maintaining the highest upside potential.\n\n[move] hare"

Risk assessment: If they do choose stag while I choose hare, I get the maximum 6 points. If they stick with hare, I get the safe 2 points again.\n\n5.

Assess current opponent mindset: Having experienced both the safety of hare and the punishment of stag, they're likely reinforced in their defensive approach.

Since their Round 4 punishment, they've now chosen hare 10 consecutive times. My total: 32 points.\n\n2. Maximum behavioral predictability: Ten straight defensive choices since their failed experiment represents complete strategic rigidity. They've shown absolutely no signs of wanting to deviate from their established pattern.\n\n3. Fresh player learning completion: After one punishment followed by 10 safe outcomes, their risk-averse strategy has become their core identity in this game. Any experimentation impulse has been completely suppressed.\n\n4. Optimal mathematical strategy:\n   - With 93%+ hare probability: Expected value of my hare \u2248 2.3 points\n   - Expected value of my stag \u2248 1.1 points\n   - The strategic advantage of hare has reached maximum efficiency\n\n5. Strategic decision: Ten consecutive identical choices demonstrates their pattern is unbreakable. Continuing with the mathematically optimal and behaviorally validated hare strategy.\n\n[move] hare"
