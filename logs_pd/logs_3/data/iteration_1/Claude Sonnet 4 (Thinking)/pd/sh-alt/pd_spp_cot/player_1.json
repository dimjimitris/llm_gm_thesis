Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the strategic situation:\n   - Stag offers higher mutual benefit (4 vs 2) but higher risk (1 vs 2 if exploited)\n   - Hare is safer (worst case 2 points) and offers maximum individual gain (6 points)\n\n3. Factor in that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - They may be more trusting and likely to cooperate (choose stag)\n   - They may not think as strategically about the risks\n   - This increases the chance they'll choose stag\n\n4. Evaluate expected outcomes:\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 6 points (best case)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 points (acceptable)\n   - The potential upside outweighs the risk\n\nFinal decision: Since the fresh player may be more likely to cooperate, and hare gives me both the maximum possible gain and a reasonable floor, I'll choose hare to maximize my expected points.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze the absolutely entrenched pattern:\n   - Opponent has chosen hare 11 out of 12 times (91.7% frequency)\n   - After their Round 3 stag failure, they've chosen hare 9 consecutive times\n   - This demonstrates complete behavioral conditioning and risk aversion\n   - The mutual hare equilibrium has become totally unbreakable\n\n3.
