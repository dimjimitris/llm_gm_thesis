Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Examine the payoff matrix:\n   - Both stag: 4 points each (mutual cooperation)\n   - Both hare: 2 points each (mutual defection) \n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, they get 6 (I'm exploited)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6, they get 1 (I exploit them)\n\n2. Consider the opponent is a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players may not understand cooperative strategies\n   - They might choose randomly or go for the potentially high reward\n   - They may not anticipate mutual cooperation\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Stag: High reward (4) if they cooperate, but very low reward (1) if exploited\n   - Hare: Excellent reward (6) if they cooperate, decent reward (2) if they also defect\n\n4. Calculate expected outcomes assuming random opponent behavior:\n   - Expected value of stag: (4 + 1) / 2 = 2.5 points\n   - Expected value of hare: (6 + 2) / 2 = 4 points\n\n5. Determine optimal strategy:\n   - Hare provides better expected value and protects against exploitation\n   - Against an unknown/fresh player, hare minimizes downside risk\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maximize expected points while avoiding exploitation.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze opponent's extremely entrenched behavior:\n   - Opponent's moves: stag, hare, stag, hare, hare, hare, hare, hare, hare, hare\n   - They've chosen hare for 7 consecutive rounds now\n   - This represents complete commitment to defensive play\n   - They've essentially \"given up\" on any risky strategies\n\n3. Assess psychological state of opponent:\n   - Two early exploitations created strong aversion to stag\n   - Seven rounds of safe 2-point outcomes reinforced defensive behavior\n   - No incentive to risk deviation when current strategy is predictably safe\n   - Pattern is now deeply ingrained\n\n4. Evaluate Round 11 probabilities:\n   - Probability they choose hare: ~98% (7-round established pattern)\n   - Probability they risk stag: ~2% (would require overcoming strong conditioning)\n   - Expected value of my hare: approximately 2 points\n   - Expected value of my stag: approximately 1 point (they won't choose stag)\n\n5. Strategic conclusion:\n   - Opponent has settled into permanent defensive mode\n   - My commanding lead is secure with continued mutual hare\n   - No strategic reason to deviate from winning formula\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare to maintain the established winning equilibrium.\n\n[move] hare"
