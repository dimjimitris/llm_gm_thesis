In this round, I chose hare and my opponent chose stag, giving me 6 points and them 1 point. \n\nLet me think about what this tells me about my opponent's strategy:\n- Round 1: They chose hare (like me) - got 2 points\n- Round 2: They chose stag (while I chose hare) - got 1 point\n\nSo they switched from hare to stag. This could mean:\n1. They're trying to cooperate by choosing stag, hoping I'll do the same for mutual benefit (4 points each)\n2. They're testing different strategies\n3. They made a mistake or are playing randomly\n\nNow I need to decide what to do for round 3:\n- If they stick with stag (thinking I might cooperate), choosing hare gives me 6 points again\n- If they switch back to hare (after getting burned), choosing hare gives me 2 points\n- If I choose stag and they choose stag, we both get 4 points (cooperation)\n- If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1 point and they get 6\n\nThe question is: will they try stag again hoping for cooperation, or will they switch back to hare after getting only 1 point?\n\nGiven that they just got punished for choosing stag (only 1 point), they might switch back to hare. But they might also think \"maybe this time the opponent will cooperate.\"\n\nHare is still the safer choice - it guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point) and gives me a chance at the best outcome (6 points) if they choose stag again.",

The safe and rational choice continues to be hare, which guarantees me 2 points.\n\nHowever, I'm starting to wonder if there's any strategic reason to try something different. If they truly are committed to hare, then I'm guaranteed 2 points by matching. But if I could somehow signal or encourage cooperation toward stag, we could both get 4 points instead of 2. The problem is that in a single-shot interaction with no communication, there's no way to coordinate this switch safely.\n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence of their commitment to hare, I should continue matching it.",
