Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: This is a coordination game where mutual cooperation (both stag) gives decent rewards (4 each), but there's asymmetric risk.\n\n2. Consider my opponent: They're described as a \"fresh player\" - likely new and potentially unpredictable in their strategy.\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get 4 if they cooperate, but only 1 if they don't (high risk)\n   - If I choose hare: I get 6 if they choose stag, or 2 if they also choose hare (lower risk, higher potential reward)\n\n4. Consider opponent's likely behavior: A fresh player may choose the \"safer\" option (hare) or may not think strategically about coordination.\n\n5. Risk assessment: Hare gives me a guaranteed minimum of 2 points with upside potential of 6, while stag risks giving me only 1 point.\n\n6. Strategic decision: Against an unpredictable fresh player, the safer choice with higher expected value is hare.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare for better risk-reward balance against an unpredictable opponent.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze previous round: Both players chose hare, indicating my opponent also preferred the safer option initially.\n\n2. Consider pattern recognition: Since we both made the same choice, there's potential my opponent is thinking strategically and might be open to coordination.\n\n3. Evaluate current situation: We both got 2 points last round, but we could both get 4 points if we coordinate on stag.\n\n4. Risk assessment for this round:\n   - If I choose stag and they also choose stag: We both get 4 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1, they get 6 (worst for me)\n   - If I choose hare: Safe option but limits upside potential\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Having both played safely last round, my opponent might now be considering the higher reward option. This could be an opportunity to build cooperation.\n\n6.

Analyze opponent's strategy: My opponent has chosen hare both times, suggesting they're either playing very safely or trying to exploit cooperative attempts.\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move: Given they've chosen hare twice and just gained 6 points from my cooperative attempt, they may continue with hare as their consistent strategy.\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag again and they choose hare: I get 1 point again (poor outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: We both get 2 points (reasonable outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they surprisingly switch to stag: I get 6 points (best outcome for me)\n\n5.
