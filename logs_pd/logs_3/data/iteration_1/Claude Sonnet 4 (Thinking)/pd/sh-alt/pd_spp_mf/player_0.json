    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Now for round 2, we have valuable information: the opponent chose hare in round 1, confirming they're risk-averse. However, this creates an interesting dynamic. Now both players know the other chose hare, which could change the strategic thinking.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** The opponent's hare choice in round 1 tells us they prioritize safety. But now they know we also chose hare, which means:\n1. They might think we're also risk-averse\n2. They could continue with hare for consistency\n3. However, they might now try to exploit our perceived risk-aversion by switching to hare while expecting us to play stag\n4. Some players develop patterns or stick to what worked\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We now have a track record. The opponent showed risk-averse behavior. If they maintain this pattern, they'll likely choose hare again. However, there's also the possibility they might think: \"My opponent also played it safe, maybe I can exploit this by continuing with hare while they switch to stag.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that we both chose hare in round 1, I think the opponent is likely to stick with their risk-averse pattern. Fresh players often don't quickly change strategies, especially when their first choice wasn't clearly wrong. They got 2 points, which isn't bad. I expect them to choose hare again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. The risk-dominant equilibrium (hare, hare) tends to be sticky once established. Players who start with the safe choice often continue with it, especially fresh players who may not be thinking several moves ahead.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent demonstrated risk-averse behavior in round 1 and is likely to maintain this pattern.

This strongly suggests the opponent has settled into the risk-dominant equilibrium strategy. The pattern is becoming established. However, this creates an interesting opportunity - if I'm confident they'll choose hare again, I could potentially switch to stag and get 1 point while they get 6. But that's risky if they also try to exploit.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** Two consecutive hare choices indicate a very strong preference for safety. Fresh players who find a strategy that \"works\" (gives them points without the worst outcome) tend to stick with it. The psychological momentum is toward continuing the established pattern. They're unlikely to suddenly become aggressive after two safe plays.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** The pattern (hare, hare) twice suggests this opponent is highly risk-averse. If I assume they'll play hare again:\n- If I play hare: I get 2 points (safe)\n- If I play stag: I get 1 point (risky gamble that likely fails)\n\nThe risk-reward calculation still favors hare. Even if there's a small chance they might switch to stag, the expected value of hare remains higher given their demonstrated behavior.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Looking at the established pattern, this opponent is clearly committed to the risk-averse strategy. Two consecutive rounds of hare indicate they've found their comfort zone. Switching to stag would be a gamble against a player who has shown no signs of aggressive play.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. In repeated games, once the risk-dominant equilibrium is established and reinforced, it tends to persist. The opponent has no incentive to deviate from a strategy that's been giving them consistent results.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has demonstrated a clear risk-averse pattern over two rounds.

This opponent has fully committed to the risk-dominant equilibrium. The consistency is remarkable - they've now been reinforced three times that their strategy works. In game theory terms, we've reached a stable repeated game equilibrium.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** This level of consistency is telling. Three identical choices indicate this player has found their comfort zone and is unlikely to deviate. Fresh players who experience success (even modest success like 2 points per round) with a strategy tend to become attached to it. The psychological momentum is overwhelmingly toward continuing the pattern.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** Let me analyze the exploitation possibility: If I'm 95%+ confident they'll choose hare again, should I switch to stag? Let's see... if they choose hare and I choose stag, I get 1 point and they get 6. That's actually worse for me! The only benefit of choosing stag would be if they also switched to stag (giving us both 4 points), but that probability is extremely low given their demonstrated behavior.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The math is clear. Even with this highly predictable opponent, switching to stag would likely give me only 1 point while they get 6. The safe play that matches their pattern (hare) gives me 2 points.

The probability they'll deviate is extremely low.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** Four identical rounds indicate we're dealing with someone who has found their preferred strategy and stuck to it completely. This level of consistency suggests either a very cautious personality or someone who has decided this approach works for them. Fresh players who establish a pattern this strong rarely break it without external pressure or clear failure.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** The data couldn't be clearer. Four rounds of the same choice pattern means the opponent is highly predictable. Since my expected payoff from hare (2 points) is higher than from stag (1 point) when facing a hare player, there's no mathematical reason to deviate. The risk-reward calculation strongly favors maintaining the pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** At this point, changing strategy would be irrational.

The probability of deviation at this point is negligible.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** Five identical choices represent an incredibly strong behavioral pattern. This goes beyond simple risk-aversion - this is habit formation. The opponent has been successfully reinforced five times that their strategy works. They're getting consistent, predictable results with no negative outcomes from their perspective. Breaking this pattern would require a major shift in thinking that fresh players rarely make.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** The statistical evidence is overwhelming. Five data points of identical behavior create a confidence interval approaching 100% for predicting the sixth choice.

We've documented eight perfect rounds already. The opponent has shown absolutely no variation in their strategy. This level of commitment to risk-averse play is virtually unprecedented in game theory literature.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** Eight rounds of identical behavior have created an unshakeable pattern. The opponent has been reinforced eight consecutive times with positive outcomes from their risk-averse strategy. The psychological momentum toward maintaining this behavior is overwhelming. Even if they're beginning to think more strategically, their demonstrated preference for safety remains dominant.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** Eight consecutive data points provide the strongest possible statistical foundation for prediction. The probability the opponent chooses hare approaches certainty. My optimal response calculation remains unchanged: hare yields 2 points versus 1 point from stag when facing a hare player. The expected value strongly favors hare.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Eight rounds have established this as a completely deterministic interaction. The opponent will choose hare with virtual certainty, making my optimal choice equally clear.
