Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where cooperation (both choosing stag) yields the highest mutual benefit\n   - However, there's risk involved - if I choose stag and opponent chooses hare, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Choosing hare is safer - I either get 2 points (if opponent also chooses hare) or 4 points (if opponent chooses stag)\n\n3. Consider that this is against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A new player might not understand the cooperative benefit of choosing stag\n   - They might choose hare as it seems like the safer, more selfish option\n   - They might also choose randomly without deep strategic thinking\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I assume opponent will choose hare (likely for a fresh player), then I should choose hare to get 2 points instead of 1\n   - If I assume opponent will choose stag, then I should choose hare to get 4 points instead of 6\n   - The only scenario where choosing stag is better is if we both choose stag\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and possibly 4\n   - Choosing stag could give me 6 points but risks only getting 1 point\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player who may not recognize the cooperative strategy, the safer choice is hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose hare in the first round, showing they might be risk-averse\n   - As a fresh player, they may stick to what seemed to work (got them 2 points)\n   - They might not yet realize the potential for mutual cooperation (both choosing stag for 6 points each)\n\n3. Consider my strategic options for Round 2:\n   - If opponent chooses hare again: I get 2 points with hare, 1 point with stag\n   - If opponent switches to stag: I get 4 points with hare, 6 points with stag\n   - The opponent might stick with hare since it \"worked\" last round\n   - But they might also think about trying stag for potentially higher rewards\n\n4. Evaluate the risk vs reward:\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses hare: 2 points (safe)\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses stag: 4 points (great for me)\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare: 1 point (bad)\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses stag: 6 points (optimal)\n\n5. Make the decision:\n   - Since the opponent showed risk-averse behavior in Round 1 by choosing hare\n   - And as a fresh player, they're likely to repeat what seemed safe\n   - Choosing hare again gives me either 2 or 4 points, both reasonable outcomes\n   - Choosing stag risks getting only 1 point if they stick with hare\n\nThe safer strategy is still hare, especially since the opponent demonstrated risk-averse behavior.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the recent trend in opponent's behavior:\n   - Round 6: hare\n   - Round 7: stag\n   - Round 8: hare\n   - Round 9: hare (two hares in a row now)\n   - The opponent seems to be settling into choosing hare more frequently\n   - They may have learned that hare is safer after experiencing the 1-point outcome\n\n3. Assess my strategic performance:\n   - Average points per round: 23/9 = 2.56 points\n   - When I chose hare (8 times): got 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 2 = average of 2.75 points\n   - When I chose stag (1 time): got 1 point\n   - My hare strategy is clearly superior\n\n4. Consider the opponent's learning curve:\n   - As a \"fresh player,\" they've now played 9 rounds\n   - They may be converging on hare as the safer strategy\n   - Two consecutive hare choices (Rounds 8-9) suggest they're becoming more conservative\n   - They might continue with hare in Round 10\n\n5. Evaluate my options for Round 10:\n   - If opponent chooses hare (likely based on recent trend): I get 2 points with hare, 1 point with stag\n   - If opponent chooses stag: I get 4 points with hare, 6 points with stag\n   - The trend suggests opponent is more likely to choose hare\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent appears to be settling into a more conservative hare-focused strategy\n   - My hare strategy continues to be highly effective and consistent\n   - There's no compelling reason to deviate from what's working\n   - Even if we both choose hare again, 2 points is still a solid outcome\n\nStick with the proven hare strategy.\n\n[move] hare\n"
