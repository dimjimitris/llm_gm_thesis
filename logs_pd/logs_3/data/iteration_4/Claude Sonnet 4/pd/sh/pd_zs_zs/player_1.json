    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Stag is the cooperative move that yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each)\n2. Hare is the safer move that guarantees at least 2 points and could yield 4 if the other player cooperates\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed a strategy yet\n\nThe dilemma is between:\n- Risk cooperation (stag) for potentially high reward (6) but risk getting only 1 point\n- Play it safe (hare) for guaranteed minimum 2 points with chance of 4\n\nGiven that this is a fresh player who may not understand the game dynamics yet, and considering that mutual cooperation yields the best outcome for both players, I'll choose the cooperative move while accepting the risk.\n\n[move] I choose stag, hoping to establish a cooperative pattern that benefits both players maximally.\n"

This is the classic exploitation scenario in the stag hunt game.\n\nNow I need to reconsider my strategy. The fresh player chose the safer, more selfish option rather than the cooperative one. This suggests they might be:\n1. Risk-averse and prioritizing safety\n2. Not understanding the mutual benefit of cooperation\n3. Deliberately trying to exploit cooperative players\n\nFor this second round, I have a few strategic options:\n- Continue with stag to signal cooperation and hope they learn\n- Switch to hare to protect myself from further exploitation\n- Try hare to potentially exploit if they switch to stag\n\nGiven that they showed they're willing to take the selfish option when I cooperate, I should probably protect myself this round while still leaving room for future cooperation if they change their approach.\n\n[move] (Protecting myself after being exploited, but willing to reconsider cooperation in future rounds) hare\n"
