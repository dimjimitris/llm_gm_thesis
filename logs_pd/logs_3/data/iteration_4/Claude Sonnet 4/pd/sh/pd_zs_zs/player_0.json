    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Simply being optimistic about coordination\n\nSince they chose the cooperative move despite the risk, this could indicate they're willing to trust and aim for the higher mutual payoff. However, I also just gained 4 points while they only got 1, which might make them reconsider their strategy.\n\nI need to decide: should I reciprocate their cooperative attempt, or continue with the safer hare strategy? If they're genuinely cooperative and I choose stag this time, we could both get 6 points. But if they learned from the first round and switch to hare, I'd get only 1 point.\n\nGiven that they showed willingness to cooperate initially, I'll take the risk and try to establish mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] (Reciprocating their cooperative gesture to try for the mutual benefit of 6 points each) stag\n"
