Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - Stag is the cooperative move that gives the highest mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - Hare is the defection move that can exploit the other player if they choose stag\n   - If both defect with hare, we both get low payoffs (2 points each)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not understand the cooperative nature of the game\n   - They might choose randomly or go with what seems \"safer\"\n   - They might choose hare to avoid the worst outcome (getting only 1 point)\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (worst for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points (good for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 points (mediocre)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Since this is against a fresh player who might not cooperate, choosing hare gives me either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n   - Choosing stag risks getting only 1 point if they defect\n   - The safer strategy is hare, which guarantees at least 2 points\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to minimize risk while maintaining decent point potential.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I got 4 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This confirms the opponent was willing to cooperate initially\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's likely thought process now:\n   - They just got burned by choosing stag while I chose hare\n   - They received only 1 point while I got 4 points\n   - They may now be less trusting and more likely to choose hare to protect themselves\n\n3. Consider the psychological dynamics:\n   - The opponent now knows I'm willing to defect (choose hare)\n   - They may feel the need to retaliate or protect themselves\n   - Trust has been broken, making cooperation harder\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options for this round:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points each (requires rebuilding trust)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point for me (risky given their likely mindset)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points for me (unlikely they'll cooperate again immediately)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points each (most likely scenario)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Given that I just defected against them, they're very likely to choose hare as protection\n   - Choosing stag would be risky as they probably won't trust me this round\n   - Choosing hare ensures I get at least 2 points and matches their likely defensive strategy\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare again, as the opponent is likely to be defensive after the previous round.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Consider the opponent's current mindset:\n   - They've now experienced both outcomes of choosing hare\n   - They know that mutual hare gives 2 points each\n   - They might be considering if it's worth trying to cooperate again\n   - They're behind in total points (3 vs my 6), so they might want higher payoffs\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - If both keep choosing hare, we'll keep getting 2 points each\n   - The opponent might be ready to try stag again to get higher payoffs\n   - If they choose stag and I choose hare again, I get 4 more points\n   - If they choose stag and I also choose stag, we both get 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent might be willing to test cooperation again since mutual hare is giving low payoffs\n   - However, they might still be cautious after being exploited in round 1\n   - Given they're behind in points, they might stick with the safer hare option\n   - I should continue with hare to maintain my advantage and avoid the risk of getting only 1 point\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare to maintain consistent scoring and avoid being exploited.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the established pattern:\n   - After the initial exploitation in round 1, we've had 3 consecutive mutual hare rounds\n   - The opponent appears firmly committed to the defensive hare strategy\n   - This suggests they've decided to minimize risk rather than maximize potential gains\n   - The pattern seems very stable at this point\n\n3.

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Rounds 2-11: Both chose hare \u2192 Both got 2 points each round\n   - Total so far: I have 24 points, opponent has 21 points\n\n2. Analyze the unprecedented pattern:\n   - We've now had 10 consecutive rounds of mutual hare\n   - The opponent has shown perfect, unwavering consistency for 10 straight rounds\n   - This represents an extraordinary level of behavioral predictability\n   - My 3-point lead has been maintained with mathematical precision\n\n3. Consider the strategic reality:\n   - 10 consecutive identical choices is virtually unheard of in strategic games\n   - The opponent has completely eliminated any element of surprise or variation\n   - They appear to have permanently adopted hare as their exclusive strategy\n   - This pattern has become so entrenched it's essentially guaranteed to continue\n\n4. Evaluate my position:\n   - I have achieved the ultimate strategic advantage: complete predictability of my opponent\n   - My winning formula has been tested and proven over 10 consecutive rounds\n   - Any deviation would be gambling against overwhelming statistical evidence\n   - I'm in the most secure winning position possible\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - The opponent has demonstrated they will choose hare with 100% reliability\n   - 10 rounds of identical behavior creates an almost mathematical certainty\n   - My strategy is not just working - it's creating a perfect winning pattern\n   - There is absolutely no rational reason to change this approach\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare as the opponent has demonstrated absolute predictability for 10 consecutive rounds, making this the most secure and logical strategic choice possible.\n\n[move] hare\n"
