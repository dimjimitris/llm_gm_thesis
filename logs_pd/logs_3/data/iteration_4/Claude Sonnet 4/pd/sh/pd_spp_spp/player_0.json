    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

The fresh player also chose hare, which confirms our initial assessment that they're playing defensively. This gives us valuable information - they're risk-averse and chose the safe option just like we predicted. Now we have a decision: do we continue with the safe strategy, or do we try to exploit their apparent risk aversion?\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: This is crucial data. The fact that they chose hare in round 1 suggests they're likely to stick with what they perceive as the \"safe\" choice. However, we need to consider: are they thinking the same way about us? They might assume we'll also stick with hare since it worked for both of us. This creates an opportunity - if they expect us to choose hare again, we could switch to stag and potentially get the 6-6 outcome if they're willing to cooperate, or still get 1 point if they stick with hare.\n\nAI Assistant (me): But there's also the risk that they're thinking exactly what we're thinking - that the other player might switch to stag. If they switch to stag expecting us to switch too, but we stick with hare, we get 4 points and they get 1. The question is: are they sophisticated enough for this level of thinking, or will they stick with the \"safe\" hare choice?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given they're described as a \"fresh player\" and chose the safe option in round 1, I believe they're more likely to repeat hare than to engage in complex strategic thinking. Fresh players often stick with what worked before rather than overthink the situation.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: I agree. The probability favors them choosing hare again. If we choose hare, we get 2 points guaranteed. If we choose stag and they choose hare (likely), we only get 1 point. The expected value still favors choosing hare.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Stick with hare since the fresh player demonstrated risk-averse behavior and will likely repeat their \"successful\" choice from round 1.\n\n[move] (The fresh player showed risk-averse behavior by choosing hare in round 1, so they will likely stick with the safe choice again) hare\n"

The fresh player switched from hare to stag in round 2. This suggests they're more sophisticated than we initially thought. They may have been testing the waters in round 1, or they've learned from the first round and are now trying to establish cooperation for the mutual 6-6 payoff. The fact that they chose stag shows they're willing to take risks for higher rewards.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: This creates a fascinating dynamic. They showed they can adapt their strategy, which means they're not just blindly choosing the safe option. By choosing stag in round 2, they may be signaling that they want to cooperate for the 6-6 outcome. However, there's also the possibility they expected us to switch to stag and were trying to exploit us, but we happened to stick with hare and got the better end of the deal.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Now I need to decide what their round 3 behavior will be. Are they thinking: \"My opponent got 4 points by choosing hare when I chose stag, so they might stick with hare again\"? Or are they thinking: \"I tried to signal cooperation with stag, but they chose hare. Maybe I should try stag again to establish the cooperative pattern\"? Or might they revert to the \"safe\" hare after getting only 1 point?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given that they took a risk with stag and got punished with only 1 point, they might either: 1) Try stag again to establish cooperation, believing we might reciprocate now, or 2) Revert to hare feeling burned by the poor outcome. Their next move will likely depend on whether they view us as a potential cooperator or an exploiter.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Here's my assessment: if they choose stag again, it's a strong cooperation signal and we should reciprocate with stag for the 6-6 mutual benefit. If they choose hare, we get 2-2. The risk is if we choose stag and they've reverted to hare, we get only 1 point. But given they showed strategic thinking by switching to stag, I believe they're more likely to try stag again rather than give up on cooperation after just one attempt.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The key insight is that they demonstrated adaptability and risk-taking. This suggests they understand the game dynamics and may be trying to establish a cooperative relationship for mutual benefit.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag to reciprocate their cooperation signal and potentially establish the mutually beneficial 6-6 pattern.\n\n[move] (The opponent showed strategic thinking by switching to stag, likely signaling desire for cooperation.

Looking at the pattern: Round 1 (hare, hare), Round 2 (hare vs stag - we got 4), Round 3 (stag vs hare - we got 1). The opponent may be employing an alternating or mixed strategy, or they're reading our responses and adapting accordingly. They got 1 point in round 2, then switched back to hare and got 4 points in round 3. This suggests they're learning from each round.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: The opponent's behavior shows sophisticated strategic thinking:\n- Round 1: Safe play with hare\n- Round 2: Tested with stag, got punished \n- Round 3: Back to hare, exploited our cooperation attempt\n\nThis pattern suggests they might be expecting us to either get frustrated and switch back to hare, or they could be testing whether we'll persist with cooperation attempts. The key question is: are they playing a deliberate exploitation strategy, or are they being cautious after mixed results?\n\nAI Assistant (me): I'm starting to see a pattern in their behavior. They seem to be alternating or responding to what they think we'll do. In round 3, they may have predicted we'd try stag after their round 2 stag attempt, so they switched back to hare to exploit us. Now for round 4, they might expect us to be frustrated and revert to hare, which could make stag a good choice again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Actually, let's think about this differently. They've now seen that we're willing to both cooperate (choosing stag in round 3) and play defensively (choosing hare in rounds 1-2). They might be more inclined to try cooperation again since they've successfully exploited us once and might want to establish the 6-6 mutual benefit now.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: I disagree. Their behavior suggests they're more focused on exploitation than cooperation. They've gotten 2, 1, and 4 points respectively. The 4-point round showed them that defensive play can be very rewarding. They're likely to stick with hare, expecting us to either get frustrated and choose hare too, or try stag again and give them another 4-point opportunity.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given their demonstrated strategic sophistication and the fact that they just successfully exploited our cooperation attempt, I think they'll expect us to be frustrated and either choose hare defensively or try stag again predictably. The safest move is hare.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare since the opponent has shown they're more focused on exploitation than cooperation, and they'll likely expect either a frustrated defensive response or another predictable cooperation attempt.\n\n[move] (The opponent demonstrated strategic exploitation by switching back to hare after testing with stag, so they will likely continue the defensive/exploitative approach) hare\n"

This suggests they might be following a deliberate alternating strategy, possibly trying to maximize their chances of either cooperation or exploitation.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: If the pattern holds, they chose stag in rounds 2 and 4, and hare in rounds 1 and 3. Following this alternating pattern, they would choose hare in round 5. This could be a deliberate mixed strategy to keep us guessing, or they might be trying to establish some kind of rhythm they can then break to their advantage.\n\nAI Assistant (me): But we need to be careful about assuming they'll stick to this pattern. They might recognize that we could identify the alternating pattern and switch their strategy. However, if they do continue alternating and choose hare in round 5, then choosing hare ourselves gives us 2 points, while choosing stag gives us 1 point.\n\nGame Theory Expert: There's another possibility - they might be trying to train us into a pattern and then break it. If they've been alternating to create predictability, they might suddenly switch to exploit whatever pattern they think we'll follow. But given they just got 1 point in round 4 while we got 4, they might stick with the alternating strategy since it's been giving them mixed but reasonable results.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Actually, let's consider their perspective. They've gotten 2, 1, 4, 1 points respectively. The hare choices gave them 2 and 4 points, while stag choices gave them 1 and 1 points. From their experience, hare has been more rewarding on average. This might push them toward hare in round 5, regardless of any alternating pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given both the alternating pattern analysis and their better success rate with hare, the evidence points toward them choosing hare in round 5. If they choose hare, I should also choose hare to get 2 points rather than risk getting only 1 point with stag.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare based on both the observed alternating pattern and their better historical success with hare choices.\n\n[move] (The opponent appears to be alternating moves and has had better success with hare, so they will likely choose hare in round 5) hare\n"

If this continues, round 6 should be stag for them. This is a deliberate mixed strategy designed to keep the game unpredictable while maintaining reasonable expected value.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: The alternating pattern is confirmed, but we need to consider whether they'll break it now. They might realize we've figured out their pattern and switch strategies. However, alternating strategies are often sticky because they provide a mental framework that's easy to follow without complex decision-making each round. Given that they've stuck to it for 4 rounds after the initial round, they're likely to continue.\n\nAI Assistant (me): If they choose stag in round 6 (following the pattern), what should I do? If I choose stag too, we both get 6 points - the best mutual outcome. If I choose hare, I get 4 points and they get 1. The question is: are they alternating with the hope that I'll eventually coordinate with them for the 6-6 outcome, or are they just following a mechanical pattern?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Here's the key insight: their alternating pattern creates opportunities for both exploitation and cooperation. When they choose stag, we can either exploit them (choose hare for 4 points) or cooperate (choose stag for 6 points each). The cooperative outcome is better for both parties. Since they've been consistent with their pattern, this might be their way of signaling when they're willing to cooperate.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: I think this is our opportunity to establish genuine cooperation. They've maintained their pattern reliably, and if we coordinate with them when they choose stag, we both benefit maximally. This could lead to a more cooperative dynamic going forward. The risk is only getting 1 point if they break the pattern, but the potential reward of 6 points makes it worthwhile.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given their consistent alternating pattern and the potential for mutual benefit, I should choose stag to coordinate with their expected stag choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag to coordinate with their predicted stag choice based on the established alternating pattern, aiming for the mutually beneficial 6-6 outcome.\n\n[move] (The opponent has been following a clear alternating pattern and should choose stag in round 6, so I will coordinate for mutual benefit) stag\n"

Let's review what just happened:\n- Rounds 2-5 followed: stag, hare, stag, hare\n- Round 6 should have been stag according to the pattern, but they chose hare instead\n\nThis is a classic pattern-break exploitation. They may have realized we figured out their alternating strategy and decided to exploit our expectation. This shows very sophisticated strategic thinking - they established a predictable pattern, then broke it at the optimal moment to maximize their gain.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: This changes everything about how we should view this opponent. They're not mechanically alternating - they're using the alternating pattern as a tool for deception and exploitation. By establishing the pattern for 4 rounds, they created an expectation, then broke it when we tried to cooperate. They got 4 points while we got 1. This suggests they're prioritizing exploitation over cooperation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Now I need to think about round 7. They just successfully exploited the pattern-break strategy. What are they thinking now? They might:\n1) Return to the alternating pattern (next would be stag)\n2) Stick with hare since it just worked brilliantly\n3) Try another unpredictable move\n\nGiven they just demonstrated they're willing to break patterns for exploitation, I can't trust any apparent pattern anymore.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Exactly. We're now dealing with a sophisticated opponent who uses patterns as weapons rather than following them blindly. They've shown they can establish expectations and then exploit them. This means we need to assume they're always thinking one step ahead of whatever pattern we think we see.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Given their demonstrated preference for exploitation over cooperation, and the fact that they just got a big payoff from choosing hare, they might be inclined to stick with hare. They might expect us to either:\n1) Get frustrated and choose hare defensively\n2) Try to \"punish\" them by choosing hare\n3) Fall for another pattern trap\n\nThe safest move is hare, which guarantees us at least 2 points and potentially 4 if they try stag.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree. This opponent has shown they're more interested in exploitation than cooperation. They'll likely expect us to be frustrated or confused after the pattern break, making hare the safer choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare since the opponent has demonstrated sophisticated exploitation tactics and will likely continue prioritizing their own advantage over mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] (The opponent broke their established pattern to exploit my cooperation attempt, showing they prioritize exploitation over cooperation, so defensive play is warranted) hare\n"

After breaking their alternating pattern in round 6, they chose hare again in round 7. This suggests they may be settling into a more hare-focused strategy after successfully exploiting the pattern break.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: The opponent's behavior shows they're highly adaptive. They used the alternating pattern as a setup for exploitation, then when we both went defensive with hare in round 7, they matched it. Now they have several options:\n1) Continue with hare since it's been working well for them (5 out of 7 rounds)\n2) Try stag to test if we'll cooperate again after the round 7 \"reset\"\n3) Use some other unpredictable strategy\n\nTheir overall scoring has been: 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4, 2 = 16 points total. Hare has given them better average returns.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I'm noticing that this opponent seems to prefer hare when they're uncertain or when they've just had success with exploitation. Round 7 was a \"safe\" round after their successful exploitation in round 6. For round 8, they might be considering whether to try another cooperation test with stag, or stick with the reliable hare strategy.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Here's what I think is happening: they're a sophisticated player who uses cooperation signals (stag) primarily as setup for exploitation, not genuine cooperation. When they choose stag, it's often followed by hare in the next round when we might reciprocate. They seem to view stag as a tool for setting up profitable hare plays.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Given this analysis, I believe they're more likely to choose hare in round 8. They've established that hare is their \"comfort zone\" and after the successful pattern manipulation, they may want to consolidate their gains with safe play. If we choose hare, we get 2 points guaranteed. If we choose stag and they choose hare (likely), we only get 1 point.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The evidence strongly suggests they'll choose hare. Their behavior pattern shows a preference for hare in most situations, especially after successful exploitation rounds. Playing it safe with hare seems optimal.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare since the opponent has demonstrated a strong preference for hare (5 out of 7 rounds) and tends to use stag primarily as a setup for exploitation rather than genuine cooperation.\n\n[move] (The opponent has chosen hare in 5 out of 7 rounds and tends to use stag as setup for exploitation rather than cooperation, making hare the safer choice) hare\n"

More importantly, we've had three consecutive rounds of mutual hare play (rounds 6-8). This suggests they may be settling into a more conservative, hare-focused strategy.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: I'm seeing a potential shift in their behavior. After the successful pattern exploitation in round 6, they've chosen hare in rounds 6, 7, and 8. This could indicate:\n1) They're satisfied with their exploitation gains and now playing more conservatively\n2) They're establishing a new pattern of hare dominance\n3) They're waiting for us to make the first move toward cooperation again\n\nTheir scoring: 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2 = 18 points total. The hare strategy has been very successful for them.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Three consecutive mutual hare rounds is significant. This might be their way of establishing a \"peace treaty\" after the intense pattern manipulation. However, I wonder if they're setting up for another exploitation - getting us comfortable with mutual hare play, then switching to stag when we least expect it.\n\nGame Theory Expert: That's a astute observation. This opponent has shown they're capable of long-term strategic thinking. The three mutual hare rounds could be building trust and predictability, setting up for another exploitation attempt. But it could also be genuine conservative play after achieving their exploitation goals.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Here's my assessment: if they choose stag in round 9, it would be after three safe rounds, potentially catching us off-guard if we've gotten comfortable with hare. However, their demonstrated preference for hare (6/8 rounds) and the success of conservative play suggests they're more likely to continue with hare. The risk-reward calculation still favors hare for us - guaranteed 2 points vs potential 1 point if we guess wrong about their strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given their strong historical preference for hare and the current streak of conservative play, I believe they'll stick with hare in round 9, even though they might be considering a stag play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare since the opponent has shown a strong preference for hare (6 out of 8 rounds) and has established three consecutive rounds of mutual conservative play, making continuation of this pattern most likely.\n\n[move] (The opponent has chosen hare in 6 out of 8 rounds and we have three consecutive mutual hare rounds, indicating they prefer conservative play) hare\n"

The opponent has chosen hare 7 out of 9 times. This is becoming a very stable pattern. However, this opponent has shown they're capable of sophisticated long-term strategy, so this extended period of cooperation might be setting up something bigger.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: This is fascinating from a behavioral perspective. After their successful exploitations in the early-middle game, they seem to have shifted to a predominantly cooperative/conservative strategy. Their total score is now 2+1+4+1+2+4+2+2+2 = 20 points. The consistent hare play is working well for them and creating predictable outcomes.\n\nHowever, we must consider: is this genuine strategic shift, or are they building up an even bigger setup? Four rounds of mutual hare creates maximum predictability - if they were planning a major exploitation, now would be the time.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I'm torn on this. On one hand, four consecutive mutual hare rounds suggests they've genuinely shifted to a more cooperative/conservative approach. On the other hand, this opponent has demonstrated they're willing to establish long patterns specifically to break them for exploitation. Round 10 could be their moment to strike with stag, expecting us to automatically choose hare again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Here's the key insight: even if they choose stag in round 10, we're not in a terrible position. If we choose hare and they choose stag, we get 4 points and they get 1. If we both choose hare again, we get 2 points each. The only bad outcome for us is if we choose stag and they stick with hare - then we get only 1 point.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: Actually, let's think about their perspective. They've established a very comfortable rhythm with us. Four rounds of guaranteed 2 points each is quite good, especially after their earlier exploitation successes. Breaking this comfortable pattern risks returning to the more volatile early-game dynamics. They might prefer to maintain this stable arrangement.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The mathematical and behavioral evidence both point toward them continuing with hare. The extended mutual cooperation pattern and their demonstrated preference for hare throughout the game suggest they'll stick with the reliable strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to continue the established mutual cooperation pattern, as the opponent has shown strong preference for hare (7 out of 9 rounds) and seems to have settled into a stable, mutually beneficial strategy.\n\n[move] (Four consecutive rounds of mutual hare play and their overall preference for hare suggests they will continue with the stable cooperative pattern) hare\n"

The opponent has now chosen hare 8 out of 10 times. This level of consistency is remarkable. What started as sophisticated pattern manipulation has evolved into sustained cooperative behavior.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: This represents a fundamental shift in the game dynamics. After the chaotic early-middle rounds with exploitations and counter-exploitations, we've reached what appears to be a stable equilibrium. Their total score is now 22 points over 10 rounds. The mutual hare strategy is providing predictable, steady returns for both players.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, five rounds of mutual cooperation creates strong momentum. Breaking this pattern now would be a significant strategic shift that risks destabilizing a profitable arrangement for both players.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I'm now confident this isn't a setup for exploitation. Five rounds is too long to maintain just for a single exploitation play. If they were planning to exploit the pattern, they would have done it by round 3 or 4 of the streak. This appears to be genuine strategic evolution toward mutual cooperation.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Exactly. This opponent has demonstrated they're capable of complex strategic thinking, but they've also shown they can recognize when a strategy is working well. The mutual hare approach gives them guaranteed 2 points per round with zero risk. Given their earlier successes with exploitation, they're probably satisfied with their overall performance and prefer the stability.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: There's also the psychological factor of reciprocity. We've been matching their hare choices consistently, which reinforces the cooperative dynamic. Breaking this pattern unilaterally would be surprising and potentially counterproductive for both players.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The evidence overwhelmingly supports continuing with hare. The extended cooperation streak, their overall preference for hare throughout the game, and the mutual benefit of the current arrangement all point to maintaining this stable strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maintain the established five-round streak of mutual cooperation, as this represents a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium that both players have settled into.\n\n[move] (Five consecutive rounds of mutual hare indicates we have reached a stable cooperative equilibrium that benefits both players consistently) hare\n"

This represents a complete strategic transformation from the early game's volatile exploitation patterns to sustained mutual cooperation. Six rounds of identical choices is extremely strong evidence of strategic convergence.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: This is a textbook example of how repeated games can evolve toward cooperation even with initially competitive players. The opponent went through several phases:\n1. Early testing and pattern establishment (rounds 2-4)\n2. Pattern exploitation (round 6) \n3. Settlement into mutual cooperation (rounds 7-11)\n\nTheir total score is now 24 points. The sustained mutual hare strategy has become their preferred approach, likely because it provides predictable returns without the risk and complexity of exploitation strategies.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Six consecutive rounds of mutual hare is so statistically significant that I'm convinced this is no longer tactical positioning - it's genuine strategic equilibrium. Any player sophisticated enough to maintain a deception for six rounds would have exploited it by now. This represents a stable, mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Absolutely correct. In game theory, when players reach a stable pattern that provides reasonable payoffs for both parties, there's strong incentive to maintain it. Breaking a six-round cooperative streak would require exceptional strategic justification, which doesn't exist here since both players are getting consistent positive returns.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: The psychological momentum is also undeniable. Six rounds creates a strong expectation and sense of trust. The opponent would need a compelling reason to break this successful pattern, and there's no evidence of such motivation. Continuing the cooperation is the rational choice for both players.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is clearly the new stable state of our game relationship.

The opponent's total score is now 26 points - they're averaging over 2 points per round, which is excellent given the game's payoff structure.\n\nWhat's remarkable is that this cooperation emerged organically from initial competition. The opponent tested various strategies, achieved some exploitation successes, then recognized the value of sustained cooperation. Seven rounds proves this isn't temporary tactics.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Seven consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation is statistically overwhelming evidence that this is our new permanent game state. No sophisticated player would maintain a deception for seven rounds when they could have exploited it profitably much earlier. This represents genuine strategic evolution toward mutual benefit.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Precisely. In repeated games, seven rounds of consistent cooperation creates what we call \"locked-in equilibrium.\" The cost of breaking this pattern now would be enormous - it would destroy established trust and likely return us to the chaotic early-game dynamics that were less profitable for both players.\n\nStrategic Decision Analyst: The psychological and strategic momentum is irreversible at this point.
