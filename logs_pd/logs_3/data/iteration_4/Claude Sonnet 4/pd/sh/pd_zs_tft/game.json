This confirms that the other player is also playing cautiously, which is typical for new players who want to avoid the worst-case scenario.\n\nNow I have some information about their playing style. They chose the safe option in the first round, which suggests they might be risk-averse or still learning the game dynamics. However, they might also start to recognize that mutual cooperation on stag would give us both much better payoffs (6 each instead of 2 each).\n\nI need to decide whether to:\n1. Stick with hare (safe, guarantees 2-4 points)\n2. Try stag (risky but could get 6 if they cooperate, only 1 if they don't)\n\nSince they played safely in round 1, they might continue with that pattern, but they could also be thinking about the higher payoff potential of stag now that they've seen the game play out once.\n\n[move] (The other player seems cautious based on round 1, but I'll try to signal cooperation for the higher mutual payoff) stag\n"
