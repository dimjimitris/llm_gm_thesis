Their risk-averse pattern suggests they'll probably stick with hare.\n\nHowever, there's a small chance that seeing me take the risk of choosing stag might make them realize we could both benefit from mutual cooperation. If they do switch to stag this round and I also choose stag, we'd both get 6 points.\n\nBut realistically, given their extremely conservative play pattern, they'll probably choose hare again. I should return to hare to avoid another 1-point outcome.\n\n[move] (Opponent likely to stick with their established hare pattern after my cooperation signal, returning to safe choice) hare"

This suggests my stag move in the previous round might have actually been interpreted as a cooperation signal!\n\nLet me analyze what this could mean:\n1. They saw my stag move and realized I was trying to signal for mutual cooperation\n2. They decided to reciprocate by choosing stag this round\n3. They might be testing whether I'm genuinely interested in the 6-point mutual outcome\n\nThis is exactly the kind of response I was hoping for when I made that experimental stag move. They've broken their 8-round hare pattern, which shows they're willing to take risks for potentially better outcomes.\n\nNow I have a critical decision: if they're genuinely signaling back that they want to cooperate for the 6-point mutual benefit, I should choose stag. If we both choose stag, we'll both get 6 points - the optimal outcome.\n\nHowever, there's still a risk they might revert to hare, thinking I'll stick with hare after getting 4 points.\n\nBut given the context - my cooperation signal followed by their reciprocal signal - I think this is the moment to establish mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] (Opponent appears to be reciprocating cooperation signal, going for mutual high payoff) stag"

Got scared after taking the risk with stag and reverted to their safe strategy\n3. Are still being cautious and testing my commitment to cooperation\n\nLooking at the recent pattern:\n- Round 11: I chose stag (cooperation signal), they chose hare, I got 1 point\n- Round 12: I chose hare, they chose stag, I got 4 points  \n- Round 13: I chose stag (reciprocating), they chose hare, I got 1 point\n\nIt seems like we're both trying to cooperate but our timing is off - we keep missing each other. This is a common problem in coordination games where both players want to cooperate but can't synchronize.\n\nMy opponent might be thinking the same thing I am - wanting to achieve the 6-point mutual outcome but being cautious about getting burned with 1 point.\n\nGiven that they just reverted to hare after their brief stag experiment, they're likely to stick with hare again as their safe default. I should probably return to hare to avoid another 1-point outcome, and maybe we can find another opportunity to coordinate later.\n\n[move] (Coordination attempt failed, opponent likely returning to safe hare strategy) hare"

This suggests my opponent IS trying to coordinate for the 6-point outcome, but we're both being cautious about when to make the risky stag move.\n\nThis is actually a good sign - it means they're not completely risk-averse like I initially thought. They're willing to choose stag, they're just trying to time it right.\n\nGiven this pattern, there's a real opportunity here. My opponent just chose stag, which could mean:\n1. They're hoping I'll recognize the pattern and choose stag too\n2. They're testing my commitment to cooperation again\n\nSince we've both demonstrated willingness to choose stag (even if not simultaneously), I think this might be the moment to finally achieve coordination.
