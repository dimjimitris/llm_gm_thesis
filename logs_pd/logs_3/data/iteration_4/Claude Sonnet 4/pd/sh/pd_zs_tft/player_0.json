    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This confirms that the other player is also playing cautiously, which is typical for new players who want to avoid the worst-case scenario.\n\nNow I have some information about their playing style. They chose the safe option in the first round, which suggests they might be risk-averse or still learning the game dynamics. However, they might also start to recognize that mutual cooperation on stag would give us both much better payoffs (6 each instead of 2 each).\n\nI need to decide whether to:\n1. Stick with hare (safe, guarantees 2-4 points)\n2. Try stag (risky but could get 6 if they cooperate, only 1 if they don't)\n\nSince they played safely in round 1, they might continue with that pattern, but they could also be thinking about the higher payoff potential of stag now that they've seen the game play out once.\n\n[move] (The other player seems cautious based on round 1, but I'll try to signal cooperation for the higher mutual payoff) stag\n"
