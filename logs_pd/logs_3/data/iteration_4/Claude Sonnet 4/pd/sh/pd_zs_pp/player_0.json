This suggests they're now being very cautious after that bad experience.\n\nHowever, this creates an interesting dynamic. If they keep choosing hare because they're afraid of getting 1 point again, I could potentially exploit this by choosing stag to get 4 points. But there's risk - if they're thinking the same way and choose stag to exploit my potential hare choice, I'd get the dreaded 1 point.\n\nThe opponent has now seen that I've chosen hare in 3 out of 3 rounds, so they might think I'm predictably cautious. This could tempt them to try stag again to get 4 points.\n\nAlternatively, they might think we're both stuck in a cautious pattern and try stag to achieve the cooperative 6-6 outcome.\n\nGiven their behavior pattern (trying stag once, getting burned, returning to hare), I think they're more likely to stick with hare again, especially since we just both chose it.\n\n[move] (Opponent seems to be settling into a cautious pattern after getting burned, likely to choose hare again) stag"

Both of us seem to have learned from the previous exploitation cycle. The opponent was thinking the same way I was - being defensive after cooperation to avoid getting exploited.\n\nNow that we've both shown we're being cautious post-cooperation, there might be an opportunity. The opponent might think we're settling into another safe hare pattern, or they might try to break out of it.\n\nGiven that we've both been cautious and are getting low payoffs with hare, and considering we've now had two successful cooperations, the opponent might be willing to try stag again to achieve the high-payoff outcome.\n\n[move] (Both showed caution after cooperation, but might be ready to try cooperation again since hare gives low payoffs) stag"

After the chaotic exploitation cycle in rounds 5-8, we've settled into a pattern where we achieve cooperation, take a cautious step back, then return to cooperation.\n\nThe key question now is whether this cooperation will stick or if the temptation to exploit will return. The opponent has shown they can resist the immediate urge to exploit after cooperation (unlike what happened after round 4), which suggests they may have learned that sustained cooperation is more beneficial.\n\nHowever, the 4-point exploitation reward is always tempting, and they might think I'm getting comfortable with the cooperation pattern and try to exploit it.\n\nGiven that we've now had back-to-back successful cooperations (rounds 10 and 12) with only one cautious hare round in between, we might be establishing a more stable cooperative relationship. The opponent seems to understand the value of mutual stag choices.\n\n[move] (We're developing a stable cooperation pattern and opponent has shown restraint from immediate exploitation) stag"
