Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice that yields high mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - Hare is the defection choice that can exploit a stag player (4 vs 1)\n   - If both defect with hare, we both get low payoffs (2 each)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not immediately recognize the cooperative strategy\n   - They might choose hare to try to get the higher individual payoff of 4\n   - Or they might choose stag if they see the mutual benefit\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 6 (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 (worst for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 (good for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 (mediocre)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against an unknown player, hare is safer as it guarantees at least 2 points\n   - Hare also has the potential for 4 points if they choose stag\n   - Choosing stag risks getting only 1 point if they defect\n\nFinal decision: Since I'm playing against a fresh player whose strategy is unknown, I'll choose the safer option that protects against exploitation while maintaining upside potential.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Identify the clear established pattern:\n   - The opponent has a consistent strategy: exploit cooperation attempts, then return to defense\n   - Every single time either player tries cooperation (stag), the other exploits with hare\n   - We fall back into mutual hare after exploitation attempts\n   - Score tally: I've exploited them twice, they've exploited me twice\n\n4. Predict opponent's likely behavior:\n   - They just successfully exploited me in round 9, then played defensively in round 10\n   - Following the established pattern, they might try stag next to exploit my expected continued defense\n   - Or they might continue with hare, expecting another defensive round from me\n   - Their past behavior shows they alternate between exploitation and defense\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent has never reciprocated cooperation - they always exploit it\n   - The pattern suggests they might try stag next, expecting me to stay defensive\n   - If they choose stag and I choose hare: I get 4 points (exploit them back)\n   - If they choose hare and I choose hare: we both get 2 points (safe outcome)\n   - Given their exploitative nature, they might try to take advantage of my expected defensiveness\n\nFinal decision: Based on the established pattern where this opponent alternates between exploitation and defense, and given they just exploited me last round, they might try stag expecting continued defense from me. I'll stick with hare to either get 2 points safely or 4 points if they try to exploit.\n\n[move] hare\n"

With two consecutive defensive rounds, we're in a stable pattern. I'll continue with hare to maintain the safe 2 points rather than risk a third exploitation.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Let me examine the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key insights:\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint payoff (6 each)\n   - But stag is risky - if the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point\n   - Hare is safer - it guarantees at least 2 points, and could give me 4 if opponent chooses stag\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I need to consider:\n   - They may not understand the game fully yet\n   - They might play conservatively (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n   - Or they might cooperate (stag) hoping for mutual benefit\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 6 (best case)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 (worst case for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 (good for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 (safe option)\n\n5. Against a fresh player, I think there's a reasonable chance they might choose hare as the \"safe\" option. If so, choosing hare myself gives me 4 points, which is better than the 1 I'd get if I chose stag.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare as it's the safer strategy that can still yield good points against an uncertain opponent.\n\n[move] hare\n"

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also chose the \"safe\" option (hare) in their first game\n   - This suggests they might be risk-averse or strategic\n   - They now know I also chose hare, so they have information about my playing style\n\n3. Strategic considerations for round 2:\n   - The opponent now knows I played hare in round 1\n   - They might think I'm a conservative player\n   - They might expect me to play hare again\n   - If they expect me to play hare, they might switch to stag to get 4 points\n\n4.

Decision logic:\n   - Since we both played conservatively in round 1, there's a chance they might try to exploit this by switching to stag\n   - If they do switch to stag, I want to match with stag to get the 6 points rather than give them 4 while I get 1\n   - This is a calculated risk, but the potential reward (6) is worth it\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to stag, betting that they might also switch to stag after our mutual hare play.\n\n[move] stag\n"

I should continue matching this with hare to secure consistent 2-point gains.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Opponent's pattern analysis:\n   - Round 1: hare\n   - Round 2: hare  \n   - Round 3: hare\n   - Round 4: stag (CHANGE!)\n   - The opponent has broken their pattern and switched to stag\n\n3. Why might they have switched?\n   - They may have realized that always playing hare wasn't optimal\n   - They might be testing if I'll cooperate (choose stag) for mutual benefit\n   - They could be trying to establish trust for future cooperation\n   - They may have noticed my pattern and decided to try stag\n\n4. Strategic implications for round 5:\n   - If opponent continues with stag and I choose stag: we both get 6 points (excellent)\n   - If opponent continues with stag and I choose hare: I get 4 points again (good)\n   - If opponent switches back to hare and I choose stag: I get 1 point (bad)\n   - If opponent switches back to hare and I choose hare: we both get 2 points (okay)\n\n5. Reading the opponent's intent:\n   - The switch to stag after 3 rounds of hare suggests they might be trying to signal cooperation\n   - They may be hoping I'll reciprocate with stag for the mutual 6-point benefit\n   - This could be an attempt to move toward the cooperative equilibrium\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose stag and they stick with stag: 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they revert to hare: 1 point (worst outcome)\n   - If I choose hare regardless of their choice: either 4 or 2 points (safe)\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent's switch to stag might signal willingness to cooperate\n   - This could be my chance to achieve the optimal mutual outcome\n   - However, it's risky since they could revert to hare\n\nFinal decision: I'll take the risk and choose stag to test if they're genuinely trying to establish cooperation. The potential 6-point payoff is worth the risk.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Round 1: hare\n   - Round 2: hare  \n   - Round 3: hare\n   - Round 4: stag\n   - Round 5: hare\n   - They switched to stag once, then immediately back to hare\n\n3. Strategic interpretation:\n   - The opponent's round 4 stag might have been:\n     - A one-time experiment/test\n     - An attempt to exploit me if I stayed with hare\n     - Not a genuine signal for cooperation\n   - They reverted to hare when I tried to cooperate with stag\n\n4. Pattern recognition:\n   - Opponent plays hare 80% of the time (4 out of 5 rounds)\n   - The one stag play happened when I had been predictably playing hare\n   - When I responded with stag (cooperation attempt), they went back to hare\n   - This suggests they may be trying to exploit rather than truly cooperate\n\n5. My performance analysis:\n   - When I played hare against their hare: 2 points each time\n   - When I played stag against their hare: 1 point each time (happened twice)\n   - When I played hare against their stag: 4 points (happened once)\n   - Clear pattern: I do better when I match or counter their likely hare play\n\n6. Strategic adjustment:\n   - The opponent seems to predominantly favor hare\n   - My best response to a hare-heavy strategy is also hare\n   - This gives me consistent 2 points when they play hare\n   - And occasionally 4 points if they unexpectedly play stag again\n\n7. Risk-reward calculation:\n   - Hare vs likely hare opponent: 2 points (good, consistent)\n   - Stag vs likely hare opponent: 1 point (bad, already burned me twice)\n\nFinal decision: Return to hare. The opponent's behavior suggests they primarily play hare with occasional stag attempts, possibly to exploit. Matching with hare gives me consistent points and protects against exploitation.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Strategic insights:\n   - The opponent heavily favors hare\n   - Their single stag choice in round 4 might have been:\n     - Testing my response after seeing me play hare consistently\n     - A random variation rather than a strategic shift\n   - They returned to hare after I tried cooperation in round 5\n\n4. My performance against this opponent:\n   - When both play hare: I get 2 points (happened 4 times)\n   - When I play stag, they play hare: I get 1 point (happened 2 times)\n   - When I play hare, they play stag: I get 4 points (happened 1 time)\n   - Average when I play hare: 2.4 points per round (when they've played hare or stag)\n   - Average when I play stag: 1 point per round (both times against their hare)\n\n5. Expected value calculation:\n   - If opponent plays hare (83% probability based on history):\n     - My hare choice = 2 points\n     - My stag choice = 1 point\n   - If opponent plays stag (17% probability):\n     - My hare choice = 4 points\n     - My stag choice = 6 points\n\n6.

Strategic conclusion:\n   - Hare continues to be the better choice mathematically\n   - The opponent's strong preference for hare makes my hare choice optimal\n   - Even if they occasionally switch to stag, hare still gives me better expected value\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare. The math clearly supports this choice against an opponent who plays hare 83% of the time.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Trend confirmation:\n   - The opponent's hare preference is becoming even more pronounced\n   - Their single stag play in round 4 looks increasingly like an anomaly\n   - They've returned to consistent hare play for 3 straight rounds since then\n\n4.

New pattern recognition:\n   - The opponent played stag in rounds 4 and 9\n   - Both times I happened to play hare, earning me 4 points each time\n   - There's a 5-round gap between their stag plays\n   - This might indicate a pattern or strategy rather than random play\n\n4. Possible opponent strategies:\n   - They might be playing stag every 5 rounds (testing hypothesis)\n   - They could be trying to occasionally exploit when they think I'll play hare\n   - They might be testing if I'll switch to cooperation after seeing stag\n\n5. Strategic implications for round 10:\n   - If they continue a 5-round cycle, next stag would be round 14\n   - If it's more random, they're still 78% likely to play hare\n   - If they're testing cooperation, they might stick with stag to see if I'll cooperate\n\n6.

Risk assessment:\n   - Hare still has better expected value\n   - I've benefited greatly (4 points twice) when playing hare against their stag\n   - Playing stag is riskier and has lower expected return\n   - Even with increased stag frequency, hare remains superior\n\n8. Performance validation:\n   - My hare strategy has worked excellently - I've never regretted playing hare\n   - Both times they played stag, I was rewarded for playing hare\n   - My only poor outcomes (1 point each) came from playing stag against their hare\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare.

Expected value calculation:\n   - With 82% hare rate from opponent:\n   - My hare: (0.82 \u00d7 2) + (0.18 \u00d7 4) = 1.64 + 0.72 = 2.36 points expected\n   - My stag: (0.82 \u00d7 1) + (0.18 \u00d7 6) = 0.82 + 1.08 = 1.90 points expected\n\n6. Performance breakdown:\n   - When both played hare: 2 points (happened 7 times)\n   - When I played hare, they played stag: 4 points (happened 2 times)\n   - When I played stag, they played hare: 1 point (happened 2 times)\n   - Clear evidence that hare is optimal against this opponent\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent maintains strong hare preference\n   - My hare strategy perfectly exploits their occasional stag plays\n   - No mathematical or empirical reason to change strategy\n   - Risk of switching to stag is high with low expected return\n\n8. Long-term perspective:\n   - We're building a solid score through consistent play\n   - The opponent's predictable pattern allows for optimal exploitation\n   - Maintaining current strategy maximizes cumulative points\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare. The strategy remains mathematically optimal, empirically successful, and perfectly positioned to benefit from the opponent's established pattern.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Timing pattern analysis:\n   - Stag plays in rounds 4 and 9 (5-round interval)\n   - If the 5-round pattern continues, next stag would be round 14 (next round!)\n   - This is an important test of whether their pattern is intentional or coincidental\n\n4. Strategic decision point:\n   - If opponent plays stag in round 13 (following the 5-round pattern):\n     - My hare choice would give me 4 points (excellent outcome)\n     - My stag choice would give me 6 points (best possible outcome)\n   - If opponent plays hare in round 13 (breaking the pattern):\n     - My hare choice would give me 2 points (standard outcome)\n     - My stag choice would give me 1 point (poor outcome)\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - The 5-round pattern has only happened once (not enough data for certainty)\n   - Even if there is a pattern, they might vary it or abandon it\n   - My hare strategy has been consistently successful regardless of their choice\n   - The risk of switching to stag and being wrong is high (1 point vs 2-4 points)\n\n6. Expected value considerations:\n   - If I assume 83% hare rate continues:\n   - My hare: (0.83 \u00d7 2) + (0.17 \u00d7 4) = 1.66 + 0.68 = 2.34 points expected\n   - My stag: (0.83 \u00d7 1) + (0.17 \u00d7 6) = 0.83 + 1.02 = 1.85 points expected\n\n7. Historical performance validation:\n   - My hare strategy has never disappointed me\n   - Every time they played stag, I benefited maximally by playing hare\n   - Every time I deviated to stag, I got suboptimal results\n   - Average performance with hare strategy: 2.17 points per round\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare. Even if there's a chance they might play stag this round, my hare choice has consistently delivered optimal results. The risk of switching strategies based on a potential pattern isn't justified by the data.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Pattern hypothesis test results:\n   - I hypothesized they might play stag every 5 rounds (rounds 4, 9, 14)\n   - They played hare in round 13, NOT following the 5-round pattern exactly\n   - This suggests their stag plays might be more random or follow a different pattern\n   - Current round 14 is still a potential stag round if we count from round 9\n\n4. Refined pattern analysis:\n   - Stag plays in rounds 4 and 9 (5-round gap)\n   - If pattern continues from round 9, round 14 could be next stag\n   - But round 13 didn't follow the pattern, so confidence is lower\n   - They've now played hare for 4 consecutive rounds since round 9\n\n5. Expected value calculation:\n   - With 85% hare rate from opponent:\n   - My hare: (0.85 \u00d7 2) + (0.15 \u00d7 4) = 1.70 + 0.60 = 2.30 points expected\n   - My stag: (0.85 \u00d7 1) + (0.15 \u00d7 6) = 0.85 + 0.90 = 1.75 points expected\n\n6. Strategic performance review:\n   - Current average: 28 points \u00f7 13 rounds = 2.15 points per round\n   - This is excellent performance in this game\n   - Hare strategy continues to outperform mathematically\n   - No evidence that changing strategy would improve results\n\n7. Risk assessment for round 14:\n   - Even if opponent plays stag (uncertain), my hare gives me 4 points\n   - If opponent plays hare (more likely), my hare gives me 2 points\n   - If I switch to stag and they play hare (likely), I get only 1 point\n   - The downside risk of switching is much higher than potential upside\n\n8. Consistency principle:\n   - My strategy has been remarkably successful\n   - Changing now based on uncertain pattern recognition would be imprudent\n   - Maintaining consistency has proven optimal\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare. The opponent's hare preference remains very strong (85%), and my hare strategy continues to provide optimal expected value and has consistently delivered excellent results.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Performance metrics:\n   - Current total: 30 points over 14 rounds = 2.14 points per round average\n   - This is excellent performance in this type of game\n   - My hare strategy has been remarkably effective\n   - Both my lowest-scoring rounds came from playing stag against their hare\n\n5. Expected value calculation:\n   - With 86% hare rate from opponent:\n   - My hare: (0.86 \u00d7 2) + (0.14 \u00d7 4) = 1.72 + 0.56 = 2.28 points expected\n   - My stag: (0.86 \u00d7 1) + (0.14 \u00d7 6) = 0.86 + 0.84 = 1.70 points expected\n\n6. Trend analysis:\n   - The opponent's hare percentage has been increasing over time\n   - They seem to have learned that hare is a safer strategy\n   - No recent signs of wanting to cooperate or change their approach\n   - Their behavior has become increasingly predictable\n\n7. Strategic validation:\n   - My consistent hare play has created a stable equilibrium\n   - I benefit maximally when they occasionally try stag (4 points each time)\n   - I maintain steady performance when they play hare (2 points each time)\n   - Any deviation to stag on my part has been consistently punished\n\n8. Risk-reward assessment:\n   - Continuing with hare: Very low risk, consistent reward\n   - Switching to stag: High risk (likely 1 point), uncertain reward\n   - The mathematical and empirical evidence strongly favors hare\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare.
