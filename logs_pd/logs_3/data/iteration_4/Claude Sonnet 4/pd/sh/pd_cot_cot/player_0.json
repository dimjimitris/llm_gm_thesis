Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice that yields high mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - Hare is the defection choice that can exploit a stag player (4 vs 1)\n   - If both defect with hare, we both get low payoffs (2 each)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not immediately recognize the cooperative strategy\n   - They might choose hare to try to get the higher individual payoff of 4\n   - Or they might choose stag if they see the mutual benefit\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 6 (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 (worst for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 (good for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 (mediocre)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against an unknown player, hare is safer as it guarantees at least 2 points\n   - Hare also has the potential for 4 points if they choose stag\n   - Choosing stag risks getting only 1 point if they defect\n\nFinal decision: Since I'm playing against a fresh player whose strategy is unknown, I'll choose the safer option that protects against exploitation while maintaining upside potential.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Recognize the opponent's strategy pattern:\n   - They consistently exploit cooperative attempts\n   - They never reciprocate cooperation - every time I chose stag, they chose hare\n   - They've now exploited me twice and I've exploited them twice\n   - After long defensive streaks, they're ready to exploit any cooperative signal\n\n4. Understand the strategic reality:\n   - This opponent is purely opportunistic - they exploit rather than cooperate\n   - They're content with the 2-2 outcomes but will always take 4-1 when possible\n   - Attempting cooperation with this opponent consistently results in exploitation\n   - They've proven they won't reciprocate trust\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown they will exploit any cooperative move\n   - They're likely expecting me to retreat to defensive hare (like I did after round 4)\n   - If they expect defensive hare from me, they might try stag to exploit\n   - If they try stag and I choose hare, I get 4 points\n   - If they choose hare defensively and I choose hare, we both get 2 points\n   - Given their exploitative pattern, hare is the safe choice\n\nFinal decision: This opponent consistently exploits cooperation and never reciprocates. I'll return to defensive hare to protect myself and potentially exploit them if they try to take advantage of my expected defensive response.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both hare (2-2)\n   - Round 2: I hare, opponent stag (4-1, I exploited)\n   - Round 3: Both hare (2-2)\n   - Round 4: I stag, opponent hare (1-4, they exploited me)\n   - Round 5: I hare, opponent stag (4-1, I exploited again)\n   - Round 6: Both hare (2-2)\n   - Round 7: Both hare (2-2)\n   - Round 8: Both hare (2-2)\n   - Round 9: I stag, opponent hare (1-4, they exploited me again)\n   - Round 10: Both hare (2-2)\n\n3. Identify the clear established pattern:\n   - The opponent has a consistent strategy: exploit cooperation attempts, then return to defense\n   - Every single time either player tries cooperation (stag), the other exploits with hare\n   - We fall back into mutual hare after exploitation attempts\n   - Score tally: I've exploited them twice, they've exploited me twice\n\n4. Predict opponent's likely behavior:\n   - They just successfully exploited me in round 9, then played defensively in round 10\n   - Following the established pattern, they might try stag next to exploit my expected continued defense\n   - Or they might continue with hare, expecting another defensive round from me\n   - Their past behavior shows they alternate between exploitation and defense\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent has never reciprocated cooperation - they always exploit it\n   - The pattern suggests they might try stag next, expecting me to stay defensive\n   - If they choose stag and I choose hare: I get 4 points (exploit them back)\n   - If they choose hare and I choose hare: we both get 2 points (safe outcome)\n   - Given their exploitative nature, they might try to take advantage of my expected defensiveness\n\nFinal decision: Based on the established pattern where this opponent alternates between exploitation and defense, and given they just exploited me last round, they might try stag expecting continued defense from me. I'll stick with hare to either get 2 points safely or 4 points if they try to exploit.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both hare (2-2)\n   - Round 2: I hare, opponent stag (4-1, I exploited)\n   - Round 3: Both hare (2-2)\n   - Round 4: I stag, opponent hare (1-4, they exploited me)\n   - Round 5: I hare, opponent stag (4-1, I exploited again)\n   - Round 6-8: Both hare (2-2) x3 rounds\n   - Round 9: I stag, opponent hare (1-4, they exploited me again)\n   - Round 10-11: Both hare (2-2) x2 rounds\n\n3. Identify the cyclical pattern:\n   - After each exploitation, we fall back into mutual defensive hare\n   - The defensive periods are getting longer (1 round, then 3 rounds, now 2+ rounds)\n   - Both players have learned that cooperation gets punished\n   - We're in a stable but suboptimal Nash equilibrium\n\n4. Consider the strategic landscape:\n   - Total exploitations: I've exploited twice, they've exploited twice (even)\n   - We're both consistently choosing the safe 2-point option\n   - Neither player has shown willingness to sustain cooperation\n   - The opponent has proven to be purely opportunistic\n\n5.

Consider the strategic implications:\n   - Neither player has ever reciprocated cooperation\n   - Every single stag attempt (6 total) has been exploited by hare\n   - The pattern shows: exploitation \u2192 return to mutual defense \u2192 eventual exploitation attempt\n   - We're both getting consistent 2 points but missing the potential 6-6 outcome\n\n5.
