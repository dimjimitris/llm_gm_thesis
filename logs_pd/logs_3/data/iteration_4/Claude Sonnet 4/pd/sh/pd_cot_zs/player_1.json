We're both trapped in a suboptimal equilibrium, earning 2 points each when we could earn 6 points each with mutual cooperation on stag. But the risk remains that if I switch to stag and they don't, I get only 1 point.\n\nHowever, I should consider: what if they're thinking exactly the same thing I am right now? What if they're also frustrated with the 2-point outcomes and considering switching to stag, hoping I'll do the same?\n\nStill, four rounds of identical behavior is a very strong predictor. The probability that they'll suddenly change their strategy seems low. The safe play remains hare, guaranteeing 2 points rather than risking the 1-point outcome.\n\n[move] (Four consecutive hare choices by opponent establishes a very strong pattern - they appear committed to the safe strategy, making hare the logical response) hare\n"

However, I'm starting to wonder if there's any point where this deadlock might break. We're both consistently earning suboptimal rewards (2 points vs. potential 6).\n\nBut here's a key insight: even if there's a small chance they might switch to stag (maybe they're getting frustrated with the low payoffs too), the downside risk for me is severe. If I guess wrong and choose stag while they stick with hare, I only get 1 point - my worst possible outcome.\n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence of their consistent behavior pattern, continuing with hare remains the rational choice.
