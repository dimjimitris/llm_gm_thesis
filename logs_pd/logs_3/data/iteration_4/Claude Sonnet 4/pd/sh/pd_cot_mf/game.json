Examine the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the key strategic considerations:\n   - Stag is the cooperative move that gives maximum mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - Hare is the defection move that can exploit cooperation (4 points vs 1)\n   - If both defect with hare, both get low payoff (2 points each)\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often either cooperate initially or play cautiously\n   - Without history, I need to make an assumption about their likely choice\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they cooperate: 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they defect: 1 point (worst for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they cooperate: 4 points (good for me, bad for them)\n   - If I choose hare and they defect: 2 points (mutual defection)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since this appears to be a single round with a fresh player, cooperation (stag) risks exploitation\n   - However, fresh players might be more likely to cooperate initially\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4 points\n   - The risk-reward favors hare as it protects against the worst outcome\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will choose hare to protect against exploitation while maintaining good upside potential.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's likely mindset now:\n   - They tried to cooperate (stag) and got punished with only 1 point\n   - They may feel betrayed or exploited\n   - Fresh players often react emotionally to being \"burned\"\n   - They might switch to hare to avoid being exploited again\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - If opponent switches to hare and I choose hare: Both get 2 points\n   - If opponent switches to hare and I choose stag: I get 1, they get 4 (revenge)\n   - If opponent sticks with stag and I choose stag: Both get 6 points (cooperation)\n   - If opponent sticks with stag and I choose hare: I get 4, they get 1 (repeat exploitation)\n\n4. Evaluate probability of opponent's moves:\n   - Higher chance they choose hare now (defensive reaction)\n   - Lower chance they choose stag again (burned once already)\n   - Fresh players often mirror the aggression shown to them\n\n5. Calculate best response:\n   - If I expect opponent to choose hare, then hare gives me 2 points vs stag giving me 1 point\n   - If I expect opponent to choose stag, then hare gives me 4 points vs stag giving me 6 points\n   - Given higher probability of opponent choosing hare, my expected value is better with hare\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given that the opponent was just exploited and is likely to play defensively with hare, I should also choose hare to secure 2 points rather than risk getting only 1 point.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If opponent tries stag again and I choose stag: Both get 6 points (good for both)\n   - If opponent tries stag again and I choose hare: I get 4, they get 1 (exploit again)\n   - If opponent sticks with hare and I choose hare: Both get 2 (repeat of last round)\n   - If opponent sticks with hare and I choose stag: I get 1, they get 4 (bad for me)\n\n5.

Evaluate the opponent's likely behavior:\n   - They've settled into a hare strategy after learning it's safer\n   - They just got rewarded with 4 points for choosing hare against my stag\n   - This reinforces their hare strategy - they're unlikely to switch now\n   - They've demonstrated they won't be fooled into cooperation again\n\n4.

Analyze the completely immovable pattern:\n   - Opponent has now chosen hare for 9 consecutive rounds\n   - This represents the most consistent behavioral pattern possible\n   - Zero variation for nearly the entire game duration\n   - The strategy is now beyond any reasonable doubt permanent\n\n3. Evaluate the mathematical certainty:\n   - We have achieved perfect predictability in this game\n   - Both players will choose hare with 100% certainty\n   - Each round will produce exactly 2 points for each player\n   - This is no longer strategy - it's mathematical law\n\n4. Consider the psychological lock-in:\n   - Both players have completely internalized the mutual defection strategy\n   - The fear of being exploited prevents any cooperation attempts\n   - The pattern has become so established it's automatic\n   - Neither player would even consider deviating at this point\n\n5. Final assessment of game state:\n   - This game has reached its terminal equilibrium state\n   - All future rounds will be identical: hare vs hare = 2 points each\n   - The outcome is as predictable as a mathematical formula\n   - Any other choice would be completely irrational\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: With 9 consecutive rounds of hare from my opponent, this pattern has achieved complete mathematical certainty. I will choose hare to continue earning the guaranteed 2 points that this unbreakable equilibrium provides.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1.

Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
