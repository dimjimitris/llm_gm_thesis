Risk-reward assessment:\n   - Continuing with hare: Very high probability of 4 points based on established pattern\n   - Switching to stag: Almost certain to get only 1 point based on historical data\n   - Even if opponent breaks pattern and chooses hare, I still get 2 points\n   - The upside vastly outweighs any potential downside\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - The pattern has become so predictable that it would be irrational to change\n   - I'm building a commanding lead by exploiting the opponent's rigid strategy\n   - The opponent shows no signs of adaptation after 9 rounds\n   - Continuing with the winning strategy is the obvious choice\n\n[move] (The opponent has chosen stag for 5 straight rounds when I choose hare, making this the dominant strategy with 4 points virtually guaranteed) hare\n"

Pattern evolution analysis:\n   - The opponent appears to have shifted strategy after 8 consecutive stag choices\n   - They may have learned that their counter-strategy was being exploited\n   - Two consecutive hare choices suggest this might be their new approach\n   - They could be trying to establish mutual hare cooperation for steady 2-point rounds\n\n3. Strategic assessment of new dynamic:\n   - If opponent has switched to consistent hare: We both get 2 points per round\n   - If opponent returns to stag pattern: I get 4 points with hare\n   - If I switch to stag against their hare: I only get 1 point\n   - Hare remains the superior choice regardless of their strategy\n\n4.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
