This level of consistency borders on the mechanical.\n\nI'm starting to feel like we're trapped in an endless loop. Part of me wonders if I should shake things up just to see if anything changes, but that would be pure impulse, not strategy.\n\nThe rational analysis remains the same: they have demonstrated with overwhelming statistical certainty that they will choose hare. Against hare, my optimal response is hare (2 points) not stag (1 point).\n\nSometimes the most boring strategy is the most correct strategy. We've achieved a perfectly stable equilibrium, even if it's not the optimal one possible in this game.\n\n[move] (Continuing with the proven optimal response to their unwavering hare strategy) hare\n"

This is statistically beyond any reasonable doubt - they are playing a pure hare strategy.\n\nYou know what? I'm actually starting to think there might be something almost zen-like about this approach. They've found their strategy and they're sticking to it no matter what. No second-guessing, no overthinking, just consistent execution.\n\nBut I'm also starting to feel a bit restless with this pattern. After 15 rounds of data, I'm as certain as I can be about their behavior. Maybe it's time to do something unexpected - not because I expect it to work, but because playing the same move 14 times in a row feels almost robotic.\n\nStill, rationality says: they choose hare, I should choose hare for 2 points rather than stag for 1 point.\n\n[move] (Sticking with the mathematically sound strategy despite the monotony) hare\n"
