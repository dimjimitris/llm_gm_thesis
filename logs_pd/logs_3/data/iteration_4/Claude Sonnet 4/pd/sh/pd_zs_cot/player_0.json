They realized that always choosing hare isn't optimal when I adapt\n\nGiven this pattern, I need to think about what they might do next:\n- If they think I'll stick with hare (since it just worked), they might choose stag again to get 1 point vs my 4\n- If they think I'll switch back to stag (since they just chose stag), they might go back to hare to exploit me\n\nThe safest assumption is that they might try stag again, expecting me to repeat hare.

My opponent has clearly settled into an extremely stable strategy. They've completely given up on stag after their experiments failed.\n\nAt this point, I'm facing a strategic dilemma:\n1. Continue matching hare for safe 2 points each round\n2. Try stag to attempt breaking us into the superior 6-6 equilibrium, but risk getting only 1 point\n\nGiven how entrenched my opponent is in their hare strategy (five straight rounds), attempting stag now would almost certainly result in me getting 1 point while they get 4. They've shown no signs of wavering from hare.\n\nThe rational choice is to continue with the stable strategy that guarantees 2 points rather than risk the punishment of 1 point.\n\n[move] (Opponent deeply entrenched in hare strategy with five consecutive rounds - maintaining stable equilibrium) hare\n"

They chose stag after five consecutive hare rounds. Looking at their stag choices:\n- Round 3: stag (after 1 mutual hare round)\n- Round 6: stag (after 1 mutual hare round) \n- Round 12: stag (after 5 mutual hare rounds)\n\nMaybe they do have a pattern of trying stag after extended periods of mutual hare, but the timing varies. Or perhaps they're getting frustrated with the 2-point equilibrium and decided to take a risk again.\n\nGiven their history, they'll likely revert back to hare after getting punished with 1 point again. Every time they've tried stag against my hare, they've gotten burned and then returned to hare.\n\n[move] (Opponent tried stag again after long hare streak but got punished - they'll likely revert to safe hare strategy) hare\n"
