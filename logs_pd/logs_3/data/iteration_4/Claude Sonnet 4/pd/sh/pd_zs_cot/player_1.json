Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze my opponent's behavior:\n   - They seem to be playing a tit-for-tat or alternating strategy\n   - After I \"defected\" with hare in round 1, they \"punished\" me with hare in round 2\n   - This suggests they understand the game dynamics and are responding strategically\n\n3. Recognize the current dynamic:\n   - We're essentially trading punishments\n   - Neither of us is achieving the optimal mutual cooperation (both choosing stag)\n   - We're stuck in a cycle where someone always gets the worst outcome (1 point)\n\n4. Consider what they might do next:\n   - If they continue the pattern, they might choose stag again (since they just \"punished\" me)\n   - Or they might expect me to choose hare again and choose hare themselves for safety\n   - A strategic player might try to break the cycle\n\n5.

Analyze what happened with the pattern break:\n   - Round 7 seemed like a potential shift, but round 8 shows they returned to anti-coordination\n   - They're now ahead by 3 points again\n   - The brief cooperation in round 7 appears to have been temporary or accidental\n\n3. Recognize the dominant strategy pattern:\n   - My opponent has consistently chosen the move that maximizes asymmetric outcomes\n   - Every time I choose stag, they choose hare (giving them 4, me 1)\n   - Most times I choose hare, they choose stag (giving me 4, them 1)\n   - The one exception was round 7 where we both chose hare\n\n4. Understand the current situation:\n   - I just chose stag, they chose hare (following their pattern)\n   - If the pattern continues, they'll expect me to switch back to hare\n   - If they expect hare from me, they should choose stag to get 4 points\n   - This means I should choose hare to get 4 points when they choose stag\n\n5. Consider the meta-strategy:\n   - My opponent seems committed to avoiding mutual cooperation (6-6 outcomes)\n   - They prefer the variable 4-1 outcomes over stable 2-2 outcomes\n   - Playing hare when they expect it and choose stag has been my most successful approach\n\n6. Make the strategic decision:\n   Based on the established pattern, I should choose hare. If they follow their anti-coordination strategy and expect me to choose hare (so they choose stag), I'll get 4 points.\n\n[move] (Following successful pattern - choosing hare when opponent likely expects it and will choose stag) hare\n"

Notice an emerging new pattern:\n   - Both rounds 7 and 9 resulted in both players choosing hare (2-2 outcomes)\n   - This happened when I chose hare twice in a row (rounds 6-7 and 8-9)\n   - My opponent may be adapting their strategy when they see consecutive hare choices from me\n\n3. Analyze the possible strategic shift:\n   - The pure anti-coordination strategy from early rounds is evolving\n   - When I play hare multiple times, they seem more likely to also play hare\n   - They're still ahead by 3 points, so their overall strategy is working\n   - But they may be trying to avoid giving me 4 points when I choose hare consistently\n\n4. Consider what they might expect:\n   - I just played hare two rounds ago and got 2 points both times\n   - They might expect me to switch to stag to try for the 6-6 cooperation outcome\n   - Or they might expect me to continue with hare since it's been relatively safe\n   - If they expect stag from me, they should choose hare to get 4 points\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I choose stag and they expect it (choose hare): I get 1, they get 4\n   - If I choose stag and they don't expect it (choose stag): We both get 6\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: We both get 2\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4, they get 1\n\n6. Make the strategic decision:\n   Given that they've been matching my hare with hare recently, and I'm behind in points, I should try stag to test if they'll cooperate for the mutual 6-6 outcome, or if they'll anti-coordinate and give themselves 4 points.\n\n[move] (Testing if opponent will cooperate for mutual benefit or continue anti-coordination) stag\n"

Recognize the crystal clear pattern now:\n   - Every single time I choose stag, my opponent chooses hare (6 times out of 6)\n   - When I choose hare, they either choose stag (4 times) or hare (2 times)\n   - They are now ahead by 6 points\n   - They have never chosen stag when I chose stag - zero cooperation attempts\n\n3. Understand my opponent's dominant strategy:\n   - They are completely committed to never allowing mutual cooperation (6-6)\n   - When I choose stag, they always choose hare to get 4 points\n   - When I choose hare, they sometimes match it for 2-2, sometimes counter with stag\n   - This is a very calculated anti-cooperation strategy\n\n4. Analyze the futility of choosing stag:\n   - 10 rounds of data shows they will never cooperate when I choose stag\n   - Choosing stag guarantees me only 1 point every time\n   - I need to abandon any hope of mutual cooperation with this opponent\n\n5. Evaluate the hare strategy:\n   - When I choose hare, I get either 2 points (if they choose hare) or 4 points (if they choose stag)\n   - This is significantly better than the guaranteed 1 point from choosing stag\n   - The worst case with hare (2 points) is still twice as good as stag (1 point)\n\n6. Make the optimal decision:\n   Given the overwhelming evidence that this opponent will never cooperate, I should choose hare to maximize my expected value.

Analyze my recent hare choices and outcomes:\n   - Round 7: hare vs hare = 2 points each\n   - Round 9: hare vs hare = 2 points each  \n   - Round 11: hare vs hare = 2 points each\n   - When I've chosen hare recently, opponent has been matching with hare more often\n   - This gives us both 2 points rather than the 4-1 split\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's evolved strategy:\n   - They still never cooperate when I choose stag (100% anti-cooperation)\n   - But when I choose hare consistently, they seem to be matching it more\n   - This prevents me from getting 4 points but also prevents them from getting 1 point\n   - They may be playing more defensively when they detect I'm sticking with hare\n\n4. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - I'm significantly behind (6 points) and need to catch up\n   - Getting 2 points per round won't help me close the gap quickly\n   - I need to get some 4-point rounds to have a chance\n   - But if they expect hare from me, they might choose stag to get 4 points themselves\n\n5. Evaluate the risk-reward:\n   - If I continue with hare and they match: 2 points (safe but doesn't close gap)\n   - If I continue with hare and they switch to stag: 4 points (helps close gap)\n   - If I switch to stag: 1 point guaranteed (based on 100% historical pattern)\n\n6. Make the decision:\n   Since I'm behind and the opponent has been matching my hare choices recently, I should continue with hare.

Evaluate my strategic necessity:\n   - I must break this pattern to have any chance of catching up\n   - Continuing with hare guarantees I stay 6 points behind\n   - I need to take a calculated risk to change the dynamic\n   - Even though stag has always failed, the situation has evolved\n\n6. Make a strategic gamble:\n   Since the opponent has gotten comfortable with the hare-hare pattern and I'm significantly behind, I need to shake things up.
