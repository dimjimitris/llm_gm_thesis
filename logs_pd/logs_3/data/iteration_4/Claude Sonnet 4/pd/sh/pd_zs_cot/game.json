Analyze my opponent's behavior:\n   - They seem to be playing a tit-for-tat or alternating strategy\n   - After I \"defected\" with hare in round 1, they \"punished\" me with hare in round 2\n   - This suggests they understand the game dynamics and are responding strategically\n\n3.

Consider what they might do next:\n   - If they continue the pattern, they might choose stag again (since they just \"punished\" me)\n   - Or they might expect me to choose hare again and choose hare themselves for safety\n   - A strategic player might try to break the cycle\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4, they get 1 (continuing the cycle)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: We both get 2 (safe but suboptimal)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 6 (optimal outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1, they get 4 (I get punished again)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   Since we're even in points and the opponent seems strategic, I should try to signal a willingness to cooperate by choosing stag again, hoping they'll reciprocate.\n\n[move] (Attempting mutual cooperation to break the punishment cycle) stag\n"

Recognize the opponent's evolved strategy:\n   - They still never cooperate when I choose stag (100% anti-cooperation)\n   - But when I choose hare consistently, they seem to be matching it more\n   - This prevents me from getting 4 points but also prevents them from getting 1 point\n   - They may be playing more defensively when they detect I'm sticking with hare\n\n4. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - I'm significantly behind (6 points) and need to catch up\n   - Getting 2 points per round won't help me close the gap quickly\n   - I need to get some 4-point rounds to have a chance\n   - But if they expect hare from me, they might choose stag to get 4 points themselves\n\n5. Evaluate the risk-reward:\n   - If I continue with hare and they match: 2 points (safe but doesn't close gap)\n   - If I continue with hare and they switch to stag: 4 points (helps close gap)\n   - If I switch to stag: 1 point guaranteed (based on 100% historical pattern)\n\n6. Make the decision:\n   Since I'm behind and the opponent has been matching my hare choices recently, I should continue with hare. There's a chance they might switch to stag expecting me to continue with hare, which would give me 4 points.\n\n[move] (Staying with hare - hoping opponent switches to stag to give me 4 points while I'm behind) hare\n"

Review the current situation:\n   - Round 12: I chose hare, opponent chose hare (I got 2, they got 2)\n   - Total so far: I have 25 points, opponent has 31 points\n   - I am still 6 points behind - the gap hasn't closed\n\n2.

Recognize the strategic stalemate:\n   - When I choose hare, they now reliably choose hare too (4 consecutive times)\n   - This gives us both 2 points and maintains the status quo\n   - I'm not gaining ground, and they're maintaining their 6-point lead\n   - At this rate, I will never catch up\n\n4. Consider the opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They're ahead and comfortable with 2-2 outcomes that preserve their lead\n   - They may have learned that matching my hare prevents me from getting 4 points\n   - They probably expect me to continue with hare since I've done it several times\n   - They have no incentive to change since they're winning\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic necessity:\n   - I must break this pattern to have any chance of catching up\n   - Continuing with hare guarantees I stay 6 points behind\n   - I need to take a calculated risk to change the dynamic\n   - Even though stag has always failed, the situation has evolved\n\n6. Make a strategic gamble:\n   Since the opponent has gotten comfortable with the hare-hare pattern and I'm significantly behind, I need to shake things up. If they expect another hare from me and choose hare themselves, but I choose stag, I get 1 point. However, there's a small chance they might choose stag too for the first time, giving us both 6 points.\n\n[move] (Breaking the hare pattern with a strategic gamble - need to change dynamics while behind) stag\n"

Confirm the absolutely consistent pattern:\n   - This was the 7th time I chose stag across all rounds\n   - For the 7th time out of 7, opponent chose hare when I chose stag\n   - They have NEVER chosen stag when I chose stag (0% cooperation rate)\n   - My gamble backfired and made my situation worse\n\n3. Analyze the mathematical reality:\n   - Every stag choice gives me 1 point and them 4 points\n   - Every matched hare gives us both 2 points\n   - When I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4 and they get 1\n   - The only way I can catch up is if they choose stag when I choose hare\n\n4. Recognize the opponent's evolved but predictable strategy:\n   - They have two clear rules: always choose hare when I choose stag, and recently match hare when I choose hare\n   - They're now 9 points ahead and their strategy is working perfectly\n   - They have no reason to deviate from what's been successful\n\n5. Calculate my only viable path:\n   - Choosing stag is guaranteed failure (1 point vs their 4)\n   - Choosing hare gives me either 2 points (if they match) or 4 points (if they choose stag)\n   - Since they've been matching hare lately, I need to hope they switch back to anti-coordination\n\n6. Make the necessary choice:\n   I must return to hare. It's my only option that doesn't guarantee making the gap worse.

Analyze the locked-in pattern:\n   - Recent hare vs hare outcomes: Rounds 7, 9, 11, 12, 14 (5 times)\n   - The opponent is now very consistently matching my hare choices\n   - This creates a stable 2-2 outcome that maintains their lead\n   - They have effectively \"solved\" the game to preserve their advantage\n\n3. Recognize the strategic trap:\n   - When I choose stag: guaranteed 1 point (opponent always chooses hare)\n   - When I choose hare: likely 2 points (opponent now usually matches)\n   - The opponent has found the perfect strategy to maintain their 9-point lead\n   - They get 2 points when I get 2, and 4 points when I get 1\n\n4. Consider the mathematical impossibility:\n   - At 2-2 per round, I will never catch up from 9 points behind\n   - At 1-4 per round (if I choose stag), I fall further behind\n   - The only way to catch up is multiple rounds where I get 4 and they get 1\n   - This requires them to choose stag when I choose hare, which they're not doing\n\n5. Evaluate my realistic options:\n   - Continue hare and hope they eventually switch to stag: low probability based on pattern\n   - Switch to stag and accept guaranteed losses: mathematically worse\n   - There's no clear path to victory, but hare minimizes further losses\n\n6. Make the pragmatic choice:\n   Since I'm trapped in this pattern and the opponent has no incentive to change their winning strategy, I should continue with hare to at least avoid making my situation worse.\n\n[move] (Continuing with hare to minimize losses - opponent has locked into advantageous pattern) hare\n"

Confirm the completely locked pattern:\n   - Recent consecutive hare vs hare: Rounds 11, 12, 14, 15 (and Round 9 before that)\n   - The opponent has settled into matching my hare choices almost every time now\n   - This is their optimal strategy to preserve their 9-point lead indefinitely\n   - They show no signs of deviating from this winning approach\n\n3. Face the strategic reality:\n   - 15 rounds of data shows opponent will never cooperate (0% stag when I choose stag)\n   - They've evolved to match my hare to prevent me from gaining ground\n   - I'm in a mathematical deadlock where I cannot catch up with current patterns\n   - Every round that passes with 2-2 outcomes cements their victory\n\n4. Consider desperate measures:\n   - The definition of insanity is doing the same thing expecting different results\n   - Continuing hare guarantees I lose by 9 points\n   - Choosing stag has failed 7 times but at least changes the dynamic\n   - Maybe after so many hare matches, they might not expect stag\n\n5.
