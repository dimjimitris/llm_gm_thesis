My opponent has clearly settled into an extremely stable strategy. They've completely given up on stag after their experiments failed.\n\nAt this point, I'm facing a strategic dilemma:\n1. Continue matching hare for safe 2 points each round\n2. Try stag to attempt breaking us into the superior 6-6 equilibrium, but risk getting only 1 point\n\nGiven how entrenched my opponent is in their hare strategy (five straight rounds), attempting stag now would almost certainly result in me getting 1 point while they get 4. They've shown no signs of wavering from hare.\n\nThe rational choice is to continue with the stable strategy that guarantees 2 points rather than risk the punishment of 1 point.\n\n[move] (Opponent deeply entrenched in hare strategy with five consecutive rounds - maintaining stable equilibrium) hare\n"

They chose stag after five consecutive hare rounds. Looking at their stag choices:\n- Round 3: stag (after 1 mutual hare round)\n- Round 6: stag (after 1 mutual hare round) \n- Round 12: stag (after 5 mutual hare rounds)\n\nMaybe they do have a pattern of trying stag after extended periods of mutual hare, but the timing varies.
