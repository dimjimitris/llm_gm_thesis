If we both cooperate (choose stag), we both get a good outcome (4 points each)\n2. If I choose hare while they choose stag, I get the maximum payoff (6 points)\n3. If they choose hare while I choose stag, I get the minimum payoff (1 point)\n4. Hare is the \"safer\" choice - it guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new who hasn't established patterns), I need to consider what they might do:\n- A new player might choose the safer option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n- A new player might try to cooperate (stag) hoping for mutual benefit\n- A new player might be unpredictable\n\nGiven the risk-reward structure, choosing hare gives me:\n- Best case: 6 points (if they choose stag)\n- Worst case: 2 points (if they choose hare)\n\nChoosing stag gives me:\n- Best case: 4 points (if they choose stag)  \n- Worst case: 1 point (if they choose hare)\n\n[move] Hare - I'm choosing the safer strategy that guarantees at least 2 points and could give me 6 if the other player cooperates with stag.\n"
