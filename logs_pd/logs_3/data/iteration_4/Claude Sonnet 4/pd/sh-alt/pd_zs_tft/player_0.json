This isn't just a pattern anymore - it's become a law of nature in our game.

We've created our own little economic system where we both reliably earn 2 points per round with zero variance or surprise.\n\nThe psychological lock-in from that first round exploitation has been so complete that my opponent appears incapable of considering any other move. They've found their safe harbor and anchored there permanently.\n\nAt this level of consistency (twelve identical consecutive choices), the probability of deviation approaches zero. I could probably leave the room and have someone else play hare for me and achieve identical results.\n\nWe're in a completely stable, if suboptimal, equilibrium that shows no signs of ever changing.\n\n[move] (Twelve consecutive hare choices - this has become pure mathematical certainty) hare\n"

We have essentially broken the game itself - what was designed to be a strategic interaction has become a mechanical point-dispensing system.\n\nMy opponent's commitment to hare has become so absolute that I could set my watch by it. This level of behavioral consistency is actually quite rare in strategic settings - most players introduce some variation, but not this opponent.\n\nWe've achieved perfect predictability at the cost of optimization. Every round, we both walk away with exactly 2 points, no more, no less. It's like we've negotiated an eternal peace treaty.\n\nThe irony is that we could both be earning twice as much (4 points each) with mutual stag cooperation, but the psychological scars from round 1 have made that impossible for my opponent.\n\nThirteen consecutive identical choices represents such overwhelming evidence that deviation would be irrational on my part.\n\n[move] (Thirteen consecutive hare choices - opponent has achieved perfect predictability) hare\n"

At this point, calling it \"predictable behavior\" understates the situation - this has become as reliable as a physical law. My opponent has essentially become a hare-dispensing automaton.\n\nWhat's remarkable is how we've transformed a dynamic strategic game into a static point-accumulation exercise. We've created our own version of a universal basic income system where we both receive exactly 2 points per round, guaranteed, forever.\n\nThe game designers probably never anticipated that their strategic interaction could evolve into such perfect routine. We've found a way to eliminate all uncertainty, all risk, and all variation from what was meant to be an unpredictable contest.\n\nFourteen consecutive identical moves represents such overwhelming statistical evidence that I would need extraordinary reasons to believe my opponent will ever deviate. Their psychological commitment to avoiding the 1-point outcome has become absolute.\n\n[move] (Fourteen consecutive hare choices - we've achieved perfect equilibrium) hare\n"
