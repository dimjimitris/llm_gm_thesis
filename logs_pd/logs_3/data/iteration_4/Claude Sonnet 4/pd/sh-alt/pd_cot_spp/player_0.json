Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Review the recent pattern:\n   - Round 8: Both hare (2-2)\n   - Round 9: Both hare (2-2)\n   - We've now had two consecutive rounds of mutual hare play\n   - This suggests we may be settling back into the stable defensive equilibrium\n\n2. Analyze the overall game history:\n   - Early rounds: Mutual hare (stable but suboptimal)\n   - Middle rounds: Alternating exploitation cycle (high variance, unsustainable)\n   - Recent rounds: Return to mutual hare (back to stability)\n   - My total points are accumulating steadily at 2 per round now\n\n3. Consider the strategic opportunity:\n   - We've both experienced the costs of the exploitation cycle\n   - The opponent may now be more receptive to genuine cooperation\n   - Two rounds of mutual hare might indicate they're also seeking stability\n   - This could be the right moment to signal cooperation without the baggage of the previous exploitation\n\n4. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - If I play stag and they stick with hare: I get 1 point (bad, but I've survived this before)\n   - If I play stag and they also switch to stag: We both get 4 points (much better than 2)\n   - If I play hare: Guaranteed 2 points if they continue hare, or 6 if they try stag\n   - The potential upside of mutual cooperation (4-4) is significant compared to mutual defection (2-2)\n\n5. Make the strategic decision:\n   - After the chaos of the exploitation cycle, this feels like a natural reset point\n   - The opponent might be thinking the same way - that cooperation could work now\n   - The stable mutual hare phase creates a good foundation for attempting cooperation\n   - It's worth risking one round to test if we can achieve the better 4-4 outcome\n\n[move] (Testing for mutual cooperation after we've both experienced the costs of exploitation) stag\n"
