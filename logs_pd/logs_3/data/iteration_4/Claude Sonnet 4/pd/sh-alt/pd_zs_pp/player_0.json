However, there's also a chance they've learned that this pattern of exploitation leads to counter-exploitation and mutual hare resets, and maybe they want to break the cycle.\n\nGiven the strong historical pattern of exploitation following cooperation, I should probably protect myself.\n\n[move] (Protecting against likely exploitation based on established pattern of betrayal after cooperation) hare\n"

They're learning that exploitation leads to retaliation cycles\n2. They expected me to play defensively and matched it\n3. They're trying a new strategy\n\nSince we both just played hare defensively, and this mutual caution might indicate we're both tired of the exploitation cycles, this could be another opportunity to attempt genuine cooperation. The 4-4 outcome is much better than 2-2 for both of us.\n\n[move] (Testing if mutual defensive play creates space for stable cooperation) stag\n"

Previously after rounds 2 and 8, they exploited me in rounds 3 and 9. But after round 12, they played defensively in round 13 instead of exploiting.\n\nThis suggests they might be evolving their strategy and recognizing that sustained cooperation is better than the boom-bust cycle of exploitation and retaliation. The mutual defensive round 13 might have been a turning point.\n\nI think there's a reasonable chance they'll continue cooperating this time, especially since the pattern seems to be shifting toward more stable play.\n\n[move] (Testing if the pattern has truly shifted toward sustained cooperation) stag\n"
