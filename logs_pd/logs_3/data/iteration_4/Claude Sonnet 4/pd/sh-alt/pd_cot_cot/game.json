Analyze the opponent's established behavior:\n   - The opponent has chosen hare in ALL four rounds without any deviation\n   - This is now a very strong behavioral pattern indicating a fixed strategy\n   - They seem completely committed to the hare approach\n   - No sign of attempting cooperation or strategic variation\n\n3. Consider breaking the pattern vs continuing:\n   - If opponent chooses hare again (extremely likely): \n     * My hare = 2 points (safe, predictable)\n     * My stag = 1 point (poor outcome)\n   - If opponent surprisingly switches to stag (very unlikely):\n     * My hare = 6 points (excellent outcome)\n     * My stag = 4 points (good outcome)\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Four identical rounds suggests opponent is either using a pure hare strategy or is very risk-averse\n   - The probability of them switching after such consistency is minimal\n   - Choosing stag would almost certainly result in only 1 point\n   - Choosing hare maintains steady accumulation of points\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent's behavior is now highly predictable\n   - They appear locked into hare strategy\n   - I should continue exploiting this predictability by matching their choice\n   - Steady 2 points per round is better than risking 1 point\n\n[move] (Four consecutive rounds of hare from opponent shows they're locked into this strategy, so I'll continue with hare for consistent points) hare\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
