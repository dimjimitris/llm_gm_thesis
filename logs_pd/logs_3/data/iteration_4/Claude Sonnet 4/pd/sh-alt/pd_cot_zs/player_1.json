There might be a pattern here where they occasionally test stag when the game gets \"too predictable\" or after several consecutive hare-hare rounds.\n\nNow I need to decide: are they signaling a desire for cooperation (mutual stag for 4 points each), or was this another random test that they'll abandon immediately like in round 6?\n\nGiven that I just gained 6 points and narrowed the gap to 10 points, and considering they might be testing cooperation again, it could be worth trying stag to see if we can establish mutual cooperation this time.\n\n[move] (Testing if this stag play indicates readiness for mutual cooperation, especially after narrowing the gap) stag\n"
