If we both cooperate (choose stag), we both get the best mutual outcome (4 each)\n2. If I choose hare while they choose stag, I get the maximum individual payoff (6)\n3. But if they choose hare while I choose stag, I get the worst outcome (1)\n4. Hare is the safer choice since it guarantees at least 2 points regardless of what they do\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't established trust or patterns yet, they might be inclined to play it safe with hare, or they might try to cooperate with stag.

They are clearly not a player who adapts, experiments, or takes risks under any circumstances.\n\nThe data is so overwhelming that choosing anything other than hare would be irrational. My opponent has proven beyond any statistical doubt that they will choose hare regardless of game history, patterns, or potential opportunities for mutual benefit.\n\nWhile the missed opportunity for 4-4 cooperation is significant (we've now left 26 potential points each on the table), my opponent has made their position absolutely clear through their actions. The guaranteed 2 points per round is the best outcome available given their fixed strategy.\n\n[move] Hare\n"
