Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a fresh player might do:\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperation aspect\n   - They might be tempted by the high reward (6 points) from choosing hare when I choose stag\n   - They might play conservatively and choose hare for the guaranteed minimum of 2 points\n\n3. Risk analysis:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 4 points (if they cooperate), worst case 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 6 points (if they choose stag), worst case 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n\n4. Since this is the first round with a fresh player who doesn't know my strategy, they're more likely to either:\n   - Choose hare for safety (guaranteed at least 2 points)\n   - Choose hare to try to exploit me if they think I'll cooperate\n\n5. Given the uncertainty about their choice and the significant penalty for choosing stag when they choose hare (only 1 point), the safer strategic choice is hare, which guarantees at least 2 points and has upside potential of 6 points.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to minimize risk while maintaining upside potential against an unknown fresh player.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review what happened in Round 1:\n   - Both players chose hare\n   - We both got 2 points\n   - This tells me the other player also played cautiously/defensively\n\n2. What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They also chose the safer option (hare)\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me - avoiding the risk of getting only 1 point\n   - They could be testing the waters in the first round\n   - Or they might consistently prefer the safer hare strategy\n\n3. Strategic considerations for Round 2:\n   - If they stick with hare again, I get 2 points with hare or 6 points with stag\n   - If they switch to stag (maybe trying to cooperate), I get 1 point with hare or 4 points with stag\n   - The key question: Will they change strategy or stick with what worked?\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Choosing hare: Guaranteed at least 2 points, potential 6 if they switch to stag\n   - Choosing stag: Potential 4 points if they also switch, but only 1 point if they stick with hare\n\n5. Since they showed cautious behavior in Round 1, they're more likely to stick with hare again rather than take the risk of switching to stag. This makes hare the better choice for me - either matching them for 2 points or exploiting them for 6 points if they do switch.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare again, as the opponent showed defensive play and is likely to repeat it.\n\n[move] hare\n"

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They appear to be playing a consistent defensive strategy\n   - They're prioritizing avoiding the worst outcome (1 point) over maximizing potential gains\n   - Two rounds of the same choice suggests this is their preferred strategy, not just initial caution\n   - They seem risk-averse\n\n3. Strategic implications for Round 3:\n   - If they continue with hare (highly likely): I get 6 points with stag, 2 points with hare\n   - If they suddenly switch to stag (unlikely): I get 4 points with stag, 1 point with hare\n\n4. Probability assessment:\n   - Very high probability (80%+) they'll choose hare again based on established pattern\n   - Low probability they'll switch to stag after two consistent hare choices\n\n5.

Pattern analysis of my opponent:\n   - They have chosen hare in ALL 4 rounds\n   - They never deviated from this strategy\n   - This appears to be a pure defensive strategy\n   - They're ahead by 5 points using this consistent approach\n\n3. Strategic assessment:\n   - My opponent seems locked into the hare strategy\n   - They've proven they won't switch even when I try different approaches\n   - The one time I deviated (Round 3), I was punished and they benefited\n\n4. Risk-reward for Round 5:\n   - If they choose hare again (extremely likely): Stag gives me 6 points, hare gives me 2 points\n   - If they suddenly switch to stag (very unlikely): Stag gives me 4 points, hare gives me 1 point\n\n5.

Pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent has demonstrated absolute commitment to hare strategy\n   - Zero deviation across 10 rounds despite various game states\n   - This is no longer a pattern - it's a proven strategic commitment\n   - They've maintained their lead through disciplined play\n\n3. Strategic reality check:\n   - My opponent has essentially \"solved\" this game against me\n   - They recognized that pure hare strategy neutralizes any mixed approach\n   - Every deviation I've attempted has been punished\n   - The only way I don't lose further ground is by matching their choice\n\n4. Game theory conclusion:\n   - Against a player committed to pure hare, my optimal response is also pure hare\n   - This creates a Nash equilibrium where both players get 2 points per round\n   - Any attempt to \"outsmart\" them has proven counterproductive\n   - They've forced the game into their preferred equilibrium\n\n5. Probability assessment:\n   - Chance they choose hare again: 99.9% (10/10 historical consistency)\n   - Expected value of hare: 2 points\n   - Expected value of stag: 1 point (based on established pattern)\n\n6. At this point, accepting the tie scenario each round is the mathematically sound approach.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maintain the established equilibrium and prevent further losses.\n\n[move] hare\n"
