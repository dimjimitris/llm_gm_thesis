He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

Pointless - they're too traumatized to respond\n   - Surprise factor? They won't change regardless of what I do\n   - Experimentation? Would only cost me points with zero upside\n   - Pattern breaking? Their pattern is unbreakable, mine should be optimal\n\n6. **Final strategic assessment:**\n   - This is now a deterministic game where I know their move in advance\n   - Hare vs their guaranteed hare gives me 2 points\n   - Any other choice would be suboptimal\n   - I continue executing the perfect strategy\n\n[move] (After eight consecutive hare choices, my opponent's strategy is completely predictable and fixed, making hare the only rational choice to maximize my score) hare\n"
