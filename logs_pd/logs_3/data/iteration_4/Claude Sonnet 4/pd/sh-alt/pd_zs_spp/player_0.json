This is a variation of the Stag Hunt game where cooperation (both choosing stag) gives a good mutual outcome, but there's risk involved.\n\nLet me look at the payoff matrix:\n- Both stag: 4 points each (mutual cooperation)\n- Both hare: 2 points each (safe but suboptimal)\n- I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, they get 6\n- I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, they get 1\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might be cautious and choose the safer hare option to avoid the risk of getting only 1 point. However, they might also be tempted by the possibility of getting 6 points if they choose hare while I choose stag.\n\nThe cooperative outcome (both stag) gives us both 4 points, which is better than the safe option (both hare) that gives 2 points each. But there's significant risk - if I choose stag and they choose hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\nFor a first move against an unknown player, I'll take a moderate risk and try for the cooperative outcome, hoping they also see the mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag\n"

This confirms their pattern: they occasionally test with stag, get punished, then immediately retreat to the safe hare choice.\n\nWe're now at 14 rounds, and the pattern is:\n- Round 4: Opponent tried stag, got 1 point, then returned to hare for multiple rounds\n- Round 12: Opponent tried stag again, got 1 point, then immediately back to hare\n- They choose hare roughly 85% of the time (12 out of 14 rounds)\n\nThis cyclical pattern suggests they might try stag again in several rounds, but for now they're likely to stick with hare after being reminded why they prefer the safe strategy.\n\nGiven their demonstrated behavior of retreating to safety after failed stag attempts, and the fact that they just experienced the worst outcome again, I expect them to choose hare for the next few rounds.\n\nThe safe choice is clearly hare for another 2 points.\n\n[move] hare\n"

They've confirmed their pattern of retreating to the safe choice after getting burned with stag attempts.\n\nThe pattern is extremely consistent:\n- Overwhelming preference for hare (13/15 rounds = 87%)\n- Occasional stag attempts (rounds 4 and 12) followed by immediate return to hare\n- Currently in a \"recovery\" phase after their latest failed stag attempt\n\nGiven that they just got reminded why they don't like stag (1 point in round 12), they're very likely to continue with hare for several more rounds before potentially testing stag again.\n\nTheir behavior suggests they're committed to risk avoidance and only occasionally test the waters. Since they just tested and failed, they're probably settled into hare mode for a while.\n\nThe probability strongly favors them choosing hare again.\n\n[move] hare\n"
