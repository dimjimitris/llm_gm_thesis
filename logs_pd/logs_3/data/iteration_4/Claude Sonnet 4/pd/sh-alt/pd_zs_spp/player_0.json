My opponent is so conditioned by the negative experiences of rounds 2 and 4 that they're extremely unlikely to risk choosing stag again. This psychological anchoring to the safe choice creates a self-reinforcing cycle.\n\nMy strategy has been perfectly executed - by consistently choosing hare, I've:\n1. Captured maximum points when they attempted cooperation (6 points in rounds 2 and 4)\n2. Secured steady points in all other rounds (2 points each)\n3.

This level of consistency indicates my opponent has completely internalized the lesson that stag leads to losses against my strategy.\n\nWe're now in what game theorists call a \"repeated game equilibrium\" where both players have settled into predictable behavior patterns. The early rounds established the \"rules of engagement\" - I demonstrated that any attempt at cooperation (stag) would be met with defection (hare), leading to their punishment.\n\nThis creates a fascinating psychological dynamic: my opponent likely knows that mutual stag would give us both 4 points instead of 2, but they've been conditioned to avoid that risk entirely. The fear of getting 1 point again outweighs the potential gain of moving from 2 to 4 points.\n\nFrom my perspective, this is strategically perfect - I maximized early gains and now maintain optimal steady-state returns.\n\n[move] (Nine consecutive rounds of mutual hare confirm the stable equilibrium, making hare the continued optimal choice) hare\n"

My consistent hare strategy in the opening rounds created a learning environment where my opponent discovered that any deviation from hare results in immediate punishment.\n\nThe psychological conditioning is now complete. My opponent has internalized that safety (consistent 2 points) is preferable to risk (potential 1 point loss), even though they're missing out on the cooperative potential of 4 points each.\n\nFrom a strategic standpoint, this represents perfect execution of a dominant strategy that has eliminated uncertainty while maximizing my advantage.\n\n[move] (Eleven consecutive mutual hare rounds demonstrate complete strategic stability, making hare the clear optimal choice) hare\n"
