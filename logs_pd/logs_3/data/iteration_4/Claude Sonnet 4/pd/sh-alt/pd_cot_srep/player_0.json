Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, they get 6\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6, they get 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperative benefit of both choosing stag\n   - They might be tempted by the high reward (6 points) from choosing hare when I choose stag\n   - They might play it safe with hare to avoid the worst outcome (1 point)\n\n3. Risk analysis of my options:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 4 points (if they cooperate), worst case 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 6 points (if they choose stag), worst case 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n\n4. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" who may not understand the cooperative strategy, and since choosing hare gives me a better worst-case scenario (2 vs 1) and the possibility of the highest reward (6), the safer strategic choice is hare.\n\n5. Additionally, hare dominates stag in terms of expected value when playing against an unpredictable opponent.\n\n[move] hare\n"

From the previous round, I learned that:\n   - The other player also chose hare\n   - We both got 2 points\n   - This suggests the other player might be thinking similarly to me (playing it safe)\n\n2. Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - They saw that we both chose hare and got 2 points each\n   - They might realize that if we both chose stag, we'd both get 4 points instead\n   - Or they might stick with hare since it \"worked\" (avoided the worst outcome)\n   - They might try to exploit me by choosing hare if they think I'll switch to stag\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If they learned from round 1, they might switch to stag hoping I do the same (mutual cooperation for 4 points each)\n   - If they're risk-averse, they'll stick with hare\n   - If they're trying to exploit, they'll choose hare hoping I choose stag\n\n4. The key insight: Since we both played conservatively in round 1, there's a reasonable chance they might be willing to try cooperation (stag) this round, especially since they've seen I'm not necessarily trying to exploit them.\n\n5. However, the risk of them choosing hare while I choose stag (giving me only 1 point) is still significant with a player I don't know well.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the fact that hare still provides better protection against the worst outcome, I'll stick with the safer strategy.\n\n[move] hare\n"

What this tells me about the other player:\n   - They seem to be playing a very conservative, risk-averse strategy\n   - They're consistently avoiding the risk of getting only 1 point\n   - They might not be thinking about the cooperative opportunity (both getting 4 points with stag)\n   - Or they might be waiting for me to signal cooperation first\n\n3. Strategic considerations for round 3:\n   - If I continue with hare, we'll likely both get 2 points again\n   - If I switch to stag and they stick with hare, I get 1 point (bad for me)\n   - If I switch to stag and they also switch to stag, we both get 4 points (much better)\n   - The question is: will they switch after seeing the same outcome twice?\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - The other player's consistent hare choice suggests they're unlikely to switch\n   - However, some players might start to experiment after repeated identical outcomes\n   - The potential reward (4 points vs 2) is significant if we can both cooperate\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   - Given their strong pattern of choosing hare, the safer bet is that they'll choose hare again\n   - Switching to stag would be a big risk for potentially no gain\n   - I should stick with the strategy that's been working and avoid the 1-point trap\n\n[move] hare\n"

Risk vs. Reward calculation:\n   - Choosing hare: Almost guaranteed 2 points based on their pattern\n   - Choosing stag: Very likely to get 1 point, small chance of 4 points if they suddenly switch\n\n5.

Strategic assessment of the situation:\n   - We are locked in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium\n   - Both getting 2 points reliably, but missing out on 4 points each through cooperation\n   - The other player's behavior suggests they will never deviate from hare\n\n3. Critical decision point analysis:\n   - If I continue with hare: guaranteed 2 points (based on overwhelming evidence)\n   - If I switch to stag: almost certain to get 1 point, tiny chance of 4 points\n   - After 5 identical rounds, this might be my moment to attempt breaking the pattern\n\n4. Risk vs. potential breakthrough:\n   - The cost of trying stag once: losing 1 point (getting 1 instead of 2)\n   - The potential benefit if they switch too: gaining 2 points (getting 4 instead of 2)\n   - After such a long pattern, maybe they're also considering a change\n\n5. Strategic reasoning for attempting cooperation:\n   - Sometimes in repeated games, players eventually try to signal cooperation\n   - If I never try stag, we'll never achieve the optimal outcome\n   - One round of getting 1 point might be worth it if it leads to future 4-point rounds\n   - Even if they don't respond this round, it might plant a seed for future rounds\n\nThis is a calculated risk, but after 5 identical rounds, it might be time to attempt signaling cooperation.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Strategic reality:\n   - This opponent has demonstrated the most predictable behavior possible in game theory\n   - 11 consecutive identical choices with zero deviation\n   - My single cooperation attempt was exploited without any reciprocal consideration\n   - We are in a completely stable, predictable pattern\n\n3. Mathematical certainty:\n   - The probability of them choosing hare again is as close to 100% as possible in strategic games\n   - Expected value of choosing hare: 2 points (virtually guaranteed)\n   - Expected value of choosing stag: 1 point (virtually guaranteed)\n   - The choice is mathematically trivial\n\n4. Game theory conclusion:\n   - We have reached the ultimate stable equilibrium\n   - Both players have learned the optimal response to the other's fixed strategy\n   - Any deviation would be irrational given the established pattern\n   - This is textbook Nash equilibrium behavior\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   - With 11 data points of identical behavior, prediction is certainty\n   - Rational play demands matching their predictable hare choice\n   - This maximizes my points given their unwavering strategy\n   - No other choice makes logical sense\n\nThis is now pure pattern matching rather than strategic thinking.\n\n[move] hare\n"
