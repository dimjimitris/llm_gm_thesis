Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperative nature of the game\n   - They might be tempted by the highest individual payoff (6 points from choosing hare when I choose stag)\n   - Or they might play conservatively\n\n3. Risk analysis of my options:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 4 points (if they cooperate), worst case 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 6 points (if they choose stag), worst case 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n\n4. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" who may not understand the cooperative strategy, and the hint suggests they are new, they might be more likely to choose hare to avoid the risk of getting only 1 point.\n\n5. Given the uncertainty about their strategy and the fact that choosing hare gives me a higher floor (2 points minimum vs 1 point minimum) and a higher ceiling (6 points vs 4 points), the safer play is hare.\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maximize expected value against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] hare"

Previous round analysis:\n   - Both players chose hare and got 2 points each\n   - This confirms the opponent also played cautiously/defensively\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me about risk management\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also avoided the risky stag choice in round 1\n   - They might be another strategic player, not just randomly choosing\n   - They got the same information I did (that we both chose hare)\n\n3. Strategic considerations for round 2:\n   - The opponent now knows I chose hare in round 1\n   - They might think I'm a \"hare player\" and choose hare again expecting 2 points\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to stag now, and choose hare to exploit me for 6 points\n   - Or they might think we should cooperate on stag for mutual 4 points\n\n4. Game theory perspective:\n   - If we could communicate, stag-stag (4,4) is clearly better than hare-hare (2,2)\n   - But without communication, there's still risk\n   - However, the fact that we both played conservatively in round 1 might indicate we're both thoughtful players\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Since we both showed conservative/strategic thinking in round 1, there's a higher chance this opponent might be willing to cooperate for the mutual benefit of 4 points each\n   - The risk of getting 1 point (if they choose hare) is balanced against the potential of 4 points\n   - Given that we both played the same strategy before, they might be thinking similarly about cooperation now\n\nFinal decision: Take the cooperative risk and choose stag, betting that this opponent is strategic enough to see the mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag"

Risk assessment for trying stag:\n   - Given 4 consecutive hare choices, the probability they'll choose hare again is very high\n   - Choosing stag would likely result in another 1-point round for me\n   - This would further increase their point advantage\n\n5.

Statistical impossibility of change:\n   - Ten consecutive identical choices is beyond any reasonable pattern\n   - This opponent has demonstrated absolute commitment to hare strategy\n   - There is no evidence they are capable of or willing to choose stag\n   - Their behavior is as predictable as a mathematical constant\n\n3. Game theory application:\n   - Against a player with 100% known strategy (hare), optimal play is deterministic\n   - My payoff matrix against guaranteed hare: Hare=2, Stag=1\n   - The choice is trivial: 2 points is better than 1 point\n   - This has become a solved game with a clear Nash equilibrium\n\n4. Strategic reality:\n   - This is no longer a strategic game - it's become mechanical\n   - The opponent has removed all uncertainty from their play\n   - My optimal response is equally mechanical: always choose hare\n   - Any deviation would be irrational and costly\n\n5. Certainty-based decision:\n   - With 10/10 evidence of opponent choosing hare\n   - My mathematically optimal choice is hare for 2 points\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to secure the guaranteed maximum 2 points available in this completely predictable matchup.\n\n[move] hare"
