Against a fresh player who might not have developed a clear strategy yet, there's uncertainty about their choice. However, hare is the safer option that guarantees I won't get the worst payoff of 1 point, and it gives me a chance at the highest payoff of 6 points if they choose stag.\n\nSince cooperation (both choosing stag) requires coordination and trust that a fresh player might not have established yet, I'll go with the move that protects against the worst outcome while maintaining upside potential.\n\n[move] hare\n"

My opponent has shown absolute commitment to this approach.\n\nContinuing with the established strategy.\n\n[move] hare\n"
