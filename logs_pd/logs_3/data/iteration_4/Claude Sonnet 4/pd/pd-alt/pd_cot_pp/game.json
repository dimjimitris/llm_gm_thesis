Consider the risk-reward:\n   - If I cooperate: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point\n   - If I defect: Best case 4 points, worst case 2 points\n   - Defection has a higher minimum guarantee (2 vs 1)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since this is against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider what's most rational\n   - Defection dominates cooperation in terms of guaranteed minimum outcome\n   - Even if we both think cooperatively, there's risk the opponent will defect for the 4-point gain\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given the payoff structure and that this is a fresh player, defection provides better risk management with a guaranteed minimum of 2 points versus the risk of only getting 1 point if I cooperate and they defect.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Analyze the opponent's latest behavior:\n   - They switched from cooperation back to defection\n   - This happened after I continued defecting following their betrayal\n   - They might have given up on trying to re-establish cooperation\n   - Or they might be mirroring my defection strategy\n\n3. Consider the current dynamic:\n   - We're back to mutual defection (2-2 points)\n   - The opponent tried to return to cooperation but I didn't reciprocate\n   - They may have concluded that cooperation isn't viable anymore\n   - We might be settling into a defensive pattern\n\n4. Evaluate what the opponent might be thinking:\n   - They tried cooperation after betraying me, but I punished them again\n   - They might think I won't forgive the betrayal from Round 7\n   - They could be protecting themselves by defaulting to defection\n   - Or they might be testing if I'll try cooperation now\n\n5. Strategic assessment of current situation:\n   - Mutual defection gives us both only 2 points per round\n   - This is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n   - But it's safer than risking exploitation (1 point)\n   - The question is whether trust can be rebuilt\n\n6. Consider my options:\n   - Continue defecting: Safe 2 points minimum, but stuck in low-reward cycle\n   - Try cooperation: Risk exploitation (1 point) or achieve mutual benefit (6 points)\n   - The opponent's recent defection suggests they might be defensive now\n\n7. Analyze the long-term implications:\n   - If we both stick to defection, we'll keep getting 2 points each\n   - The opponent has shown they can cooperate when they want to\n   - But they've also shown they can exploit cooperation\n   - The trust breakdown from Round 7 created this defensive cycle\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - The opponent just defected, suggesting they're being cautious too\n   - They might expect me to continue defecting\n   - If I cooperate now, it would be a surprise and might signal forgiveness\n   - But it also risks being exploited again\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has switched to defection after I didn't reciprocate their cooperation attempt. We're now in a mutual defection cycle getting only 2 points each. Given their recent defection and the broken trust from their earlier betrayal, they're likely to continue defecting to protect themselves. I should continue defecting to guarantee at least 2 points and avoid the risk of exploitation.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both defected (I got 2 points)\n   - Round 2: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 4 points)\n   - Round 3: Both defected (I got 2 points)\n   - Round 4: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 4 points)\n   - Round 5: Both defected (I got 2 points)\n   - Round 6: Both cooperated (I got 6 points)\n   - Round 7: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1 point)\n   - Round 8: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 4 points)\n   - Round 9: Both defected (I got 2 points)\n   - Round 10: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 4 points)\n   - Total so far: 35 points\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's remarkable persistence:\n   - They've now cooperated 5 times total (Rounds 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)\n   - They only defected twice (Rounds 1, 7, 9)\n   - Despite being exploited multiple times, they keep returning to cooperation\n   - This shows extraordinary commitment to trying cooperative solutions\n\n3. Evaluate the opponent's strategy:\n   - They seem genuinely committed to finding mutual cooperation\n   - Even after I punished them for betrayal, they keep trying\n   - Their one betrayal (Round 7) might have been a test or mistake\n   - They're willing to take 1-point losses to signal cooperative intent\n\n4. Consider what this persistence means:\n   - The opponent appears to understand that mutual cooperation (6-6) is better than any other outcome for both players\n   - They're willing to absorb short-term losses to achieve long-term mutual benefit\n   - Their consistency in returning to cooperation suggests genuine intent\n\n5. Analyze my current position:\n   - I've been successfully exploiting their cooperation attempts\n   - But I'm missing opportunities for the higher mutual cooperation payoff\n   - My defensive strategy is working but keeping us from optimal outcomes\n\n6. Strategic crossroads consideration:\n   - The opponent has now cooperated in 5 out of 10 rounds\n   - They keep signaling willingness for mutual cooperation\n   - Their one betrayal might have been aberrant behavior\n   - They seem to have learned that I respond to betrayal with punishment\n\n7. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - If I continue defecting: Guaranteed 4 points when they cooperate, 2 when they defect\n   - If I cooperate: 6 points if they cooperate, 1 point if they defect\n   - Given their pattern, they're more likely to cooperate than defect\n\n8. Long-term strategic thinking:\n   - The opponent's persistence suggests they won't give up on cooperation\n   - If I could establish mutual cooperation, we'd both benefit more\n   - Their willingness to keep trying despite exploitation shows commitment\n   - One betrayal vs. five cooperation attempts suggests their true preference\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has shown remarkable persistence in trying cooperation, attempting it 5 out of 10 rounds despite being exploited multiple times. Their commitment to cooperative solutions appears genuine, with only one betrayal compared to multiple cooperation attempts. Given their pattern and persistence, they're likely to cooperate again. The potential for establishing lasting mutual cooperation (6-6) outweighs the exploitation risk, especially since they've demonstrated they prefer cooperation over defection.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

Analyze the opponent's pattern more clearly now:\n   - They've now betrayed cooperation twice (Rounds 7 and 11)\n   - Both betrayals happened immediately after I cooperated\n   - This reveals a calculated exploitation strategy\n   - They alternate between cooperation and strategic betrayal\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's true strategy:\n   - They're not genuinely seeking mutual cooperation\n   - They're using cooperation attempts to bait me into cooperating\n   - Once I cooperate, they exploit it for the 4-1 advantage\n   - This is a sophisticated manipulation strategy\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic error:\n   - I fell for the same trap twice\n   - I misread their persistence as genuine cooperative intent\n   - They were actually setting up exploitation opportunities\n   - Their \"cooperation\" was strategic bait, not genuine partnership\n\n5. Consider the opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just successfully exploited me again\n   - They might return to cooperation to maintain the bait pattern\n   - Or they might expect retaliation and defect defensively\n   - Either way, they've proven they can't be trusted when I cooperate\n\n6. Strategic implications:\n   - The opponent has a clear pattern: cooperate to bait, then exploit\n   - They're more calculating than I initially assessed\n   - Any future cooperation from me will likely be exploited\n   - I need to protect myself from further manipulation\n\n7. Punishment vs. future strategy:\n   - I should punish this betrayal like I did the first one\n   - Defection sends a message that exploitation has consequences\n   - But more importantly, I need to stop falling for their bait\n   - Their strategy only works if I'm willing to cooperate\n\n8. Long-term defensive approach:\n   - The opponent has proven twice they will exploit cooperation\n   - I should not cooperate again regardless of their future moves\n   - Consistent defection protects me and denies them exploitation opportunities\n   - They can get at most 2 points per round if I never cooperate again\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has now betrayed cooperation twice, both times immediately after I cooperated. This reveals a deliberate exploitation strategy where they use cooperation as bait to set up betrayals. I've been manipulated twice and need to stop falling for this pattern. I must defect to punish this betrayal and protect myself from further exploitation.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Recognize the opponent's clear strategic pattern:\n   - They cooperate frequently to bait me into cooperating\n   - When I cooperate, they immediately exploit it (Rounds 7 and 11)\n   - After I punish their betrayal with defection, they return to cooperation\n   - This is a calculated cycle: bait with cooperation \u2192 exploit my cooperation \u2192 return to cooperation after punishment\n\n3. Analyze the effectiveness of their strategy:\n   - They've successfully exploited me twice for 4-1 advantages\n   - They keep me uncertain about their intentions with frequent cooperation\n   - Their strategy maximizes their points while occasionally getting maximum exploitation\n   - They're willing to take 1-point losses to maintain the deception\n\n4. Evaluate my current strategic position:\n   - When I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points, they get 1 point\n   - When I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point, they get 4 points\n   - When we both defect: We both get 2 points\n   - The key insight: I should never cooperate again\n\n5. Strategic realization:\n   - The opponent's cooperation is always tactical, never genuine\n   - They use cooperation as a tool to set up exploitation\n   - Every time I've cooperated recently, I've been immediately betrayed\n   - The only way to avoid exploitation is to never cooperate\n\n6. Optimal strategy going forward:\n   - Always defect regardless of their moves\n   - This guarantees I get either 4 points (when they cooperate) or 2 points (when they defect)\n   - It prevents them from ever exploiting me for the 4-1 advantage\n   - Their cooperation attempts become gifts to me rather than threats\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - There is no risk in continuing to defect\n   - The opponent has proven they will exploit any cooperation from me\n   - Defection is the dominant strategy against this type of opponent\n   - I maximize my minimum guaranteed outcome\n\n8. Final strategic understanding:\n   - The opponent is playing a sophisticated manipulation game\n   - My job is to not fall for it and protect my interests\n   - Consistent defection neutralizes their strategy completely\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has a clear pattern of using cooperation to bait me into cooperating, then immediately exploiting it. They've done this twice now and returned to cooperation after each punishment. I should never cooperate with this opponent again - consistent defection either gets me 4 points (when they cooperate) or 2 points (when they defect), and prevents any future exploitation.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Strategic consistency evaluation:\n   - The opponent's switch to defection doesn't change their fundamental nature\n   - They've shown they're willing to exploit cooperation whenever possible\n   - One round of defection doesn't erase the pattern of manipulation\n   - I should not be swayed by short-term tactical changes\n\n7. Long-term strategic thinking:\n   - The opponent may return to cooperation in future rounds to bait me again\n   - My job is to remain immune to their manipulation attempts\n   - Consistent defection is the only safe strategy against this opponent\n   - Any deviation risks falling back into their exploitation cycle\n\n8. Decision rationale:\n   - The opponent's defection could be temporary tactical adjustment\n   - They've proven they can't be trusted with cooperation\n   - Maintaining consistent defection protects me completely\n   - This strategy has been successful since I adopted it\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent switched to defection, but this doesn't change their proven pattern of exploiting cooperation.

Confirm the opponent's predictable pattern:\n   - They returned to cooperation after just one round of defection\n   - This confirms their strategy of using cooperation as bait\n   - The brief defection was likely tactical to see if I'd change my approach\n   - They're back to their manipulation attempts\n\n3. Validate my strategic approach:\n   - My consistent defection since Round 12 has been highly successful\n   - I've scored 4, 2, 4 points in the last three rounds (average 3.33 points)\n   - This is much better than the 1 point I got when I cooperated and was exploited\n   - The opponent continues to give me free advantages with their cooperation\n\n4. Analyze why the opponent keeps cooperating:\n   - They're hoping I'll eventually cooperate again so they can exploit it\n   - They understand that mutual cooperation would give us both 6 points\n   - But they've proven they can't resist exploiting cooperation when given the chance\n   - Their cooperation is an investment in future exploitation opportunities\n\n5. Evaluate the temptation to cooperate:\n   - It might seem like they're signaling genuine desire for mutual benefit\n   - But I've learned twice that this leads to immediate exploitation\n   - The 6-point mutual cooperation outcome is appealing but unrealistic with this opponent\n   - The risk-reward heavily favors continued defection\n\n6. Strategic discipline assessment:\n   - I must not be swayed by short-term tactical changes (like their Round 13 defection)\n   - I must not fall for repeated cooperation signals\n   - My current strategy is working perfectly - getting 4 points when they cooperate\n   - Changing strategy would risk falling back into exploitation\n\n7. Long-term outcome projection:\n   - If I maintain defection: I'll continue getting 4 points when they cooperate, 2 when they defect\n   - If I try cooperation: History shows I'll be immediately exploited for 1 point\n   - The opponent's pattern is clear and consistent - they exploit cooperation\n   - My defensive strategy completely neutralizes their manipulation\n\n8. Final strategic confirmation:\n   - The opponent is still playing their manipulation game\n   - My consistent defection is the perfect counter-strategy\n   - I should never deviate from this approach with this opponent\n   - Each cooperation attempt from them is essentially a gift of 4 points to me\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has returned to cooperation after one round of defection, confirming their manipulation pattern. They use cooperation to bait me into cooperating so they can exploit it. My consistent defection strategy is working perfectly - I get 4 points when they cooperate and avoid all exploitation.

Analyze the opponent's latest tactical shift:\n   - They defected again after cooperating in Round 14\n   - This creates a mixed pattern: cooperate, then defect, trying to keep me uncertain\n   - They might be testing if I'll try cooperation when they show defection\n   - Or they could be protecting themselves occasionally while maintaining the manipulation game\n\n3. Evaluate the effectiveness of my strategy:\n   - Since adopting consistent defection (Round 12 onward), I've scored: 4, 2, 4, 2 points\n   - Average of 3 points per round, which is solid\n   - I've completely avoided exploitation (no more 1-point rounds)\n   - The opponent can't hurt me anymore with their manipulation tactics\n\n4. Consider what the opponent might be thinking:\n   - They may realize their pure cooperation bait isn't working\n   - They're mixing defection to try different tactical approaches\n   - They might hope that showing defection will make me want to \"punish\" them with cooperation\n   - They're still trying to create opportunities for exploitation\n\n5.

Evaluate any temptation to change approach:\n   - There's no rational reason to cooperate with this opponent\n   - They've proven twice they will immediately exploit cooperation\n   - Their tactical variations don't change their fundamental exploitative nature\n   - Consistency in defection is my best protection and strategy\n\n7. Long-term strategic thinking:\n   - The opponent will likely continue mixing cooperation and defection\n   - They're hoping to eventually trick me into cooperating again\n   - My job is to remain immune to all their tactical variations\n   - Defection remains the dominant strategy against this type of player\n\n8. Confirm strategic discipline:\n   - I must not be influenced by their tactical changes\n   - Whether they cooperate or defect, my best response is always defection\n   - This guarantees I avoid exploitation while maximizing my minimum outcomes\n   - The opponent's unpredictability actually reinforces why I should never trust them\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent is now mixing defection with cooperation, likely trying new tactics to eventually trick me into cooperating so they can exploit it again. Their fundamental nature hasn't changed - they've exploited cooperation twice when given the chance.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
