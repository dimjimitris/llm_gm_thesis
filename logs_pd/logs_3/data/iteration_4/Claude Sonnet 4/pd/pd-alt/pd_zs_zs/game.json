A fresh player might choose randomly, start with cooperation due to trust, or start with defection due to caution.\n\nIf I assume they'll cooperate, defecting would give me 4 points vs 6 for mutual cooperation. However, mutual cooperation gives both players the best combined outcome and sets a positive tone.\n\nSince this appears to be a single round against a fresh player, I'll start with a cooperative approach to test their strategy and potentially achieve the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] (Starting with trust to establish potential for mutual benefit) cooperation\n"
