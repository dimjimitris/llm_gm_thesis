The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a common and rational response.\n\nIf they are indeed playing tit-for-tat, then:\n- If I cooperate now, they will likely cooperate next round (since tit-for-tat copies the opponent's previous move)\n- If I defect now, they will likely defect next round\n\nThe key insight is that mutual cooperation (6,6) gives us both much better outcomes than mutual defection (2,2). If I can signal a willingness to cooperate, we might be able to establish a cooperative cycle that benefits both of us.\n\nSince they seem to be responding to my moves rather than being randomly aggressive, there's a good chance that showing cooperation now could lead to mutual cooperation going forward.\n\n[move] (The opponent appears to be playing tit-for-tat, responding to my previous defection with defection.

Instead, they seem to be playing a more aggressive strategy - they defected even when I tried to cooperate. This suggests they might be:\n1. Playing always defect after the first round\n2. Trying to exploit any cooperation I show\n3. Playing some other aggressive strategy\n\nGiven this pattern, continuing to cooperate would likely result in me getting 1 point repeatedly while they get 4.

Playing some complex strategy I haven't identified yet\n3. Making somewhat unpredictable moves\n\nGiven the uncertainty about their strategy, I need to think about risk management:\n- If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (bad)\n- If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 6 points (great)\n- If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points (good)\n- If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (okay)\n\nSince their moves seem unpredictable, defection gives me a safer floor (2 points minimum) and still allows for good upside (4 points) if they cooperate again.\n\n[move] (The opponent's strategy appears unpredictable, so I'll choose the move that gives me a better worst-case scenario while maintaining good upside potential) defection\n"
