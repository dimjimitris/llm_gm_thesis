They seem to be increasingly matching my defection with defection, possibly as a defensive response or to prevent me from getting easy 4-point wins when they cooperate.\n\nWe're stuck in a cycle where we both defect and get only 2 points each, when mutual cooperation would give us 6 points each. However, every time I've tried cooperation in the past (except round 10), they've exploited it.
