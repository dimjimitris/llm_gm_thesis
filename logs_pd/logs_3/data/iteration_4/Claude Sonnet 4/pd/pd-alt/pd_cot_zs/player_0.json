Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both defect: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Consider that this is against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely haven't developed a strategy yet and might be more inclined to cooperate initially.\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 6 points (good outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 4 points (exploitative but profitable)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points (mutual punishment)\n\n4. Since this appears to be a single round and the opponent is fresh/new, there's a reasonable chance they might cooperate. However, defection guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point) and gives me a chance at 4 points if they cooperate.\n\n5. The safe strategy that avoids the worst case while potentially exploiting a cooperative opponent is defection.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Defect to maximize expected points against an unknown opponent.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Analyze what happened in the previous round:\n   - I defected, opponent cooperated\n   - I got 4 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This confirms my opponent was willing to cooperate initially\n\n2. Consider the opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just got exploited (1 point while I got 4)\n   - Fresh players often react to being exploited by switching to defection\n   - They may now be more cautious and less trusting\n\n3. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 6 points each (mutual benefit)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point for me (punishment for my previous defection)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 4 points for me (unlikely they'll cooperate again)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points each (mutual punishment)\n\n4. Assess probabilities:\n   - High chance opponent will defect this round due to retaliation\n   - Low chance they'll cooperate again after being exploited\n   - If they defect, I'm better off defecting too (2 points vs 1 point)\n\n5. The defensive strategy is to defect, protecting against retaliation while ensuring I don't get the worst outcome.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection to protect against likely retaliation.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Understand the opponent's behavior:\n   - Started cooperatively (typical for fresh players)\n   - Switched to defection after being exploited (predictable retaliation)\n   - Now we're in a mutual defection pattern\n\n3. Consider the current dynamics:\n   - We're both stuck in the 2-point mutual defection outcome\n   - This is suboptimal for both of us compared to mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n   - Someone needs to break the cycle to reach better outcomes\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they continue defecting: 1 point (risky)\n   - If I cooperate and they also cooperate: 6 points (optimal)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 4 points (exploitative again)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points (current pattern continues)\n\n5. Strategic consideration:\n   - Continuing mutual defection gives steady but low returns\n   - Cooperation could signal willingness to move toward mutual benefit\n   - Since they retaliated once, they might be open to cooperation if I show good faith\n\n6. Taking a calculated risk to break the deadlock and potentially establish mutual cooperation.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Cooperate to potentially break the mutual defection cycle and signal willingness for better outcomes.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"
