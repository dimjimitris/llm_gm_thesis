    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Key considerations:\n- They defected on the first round, showing they're willing to exploit cooperation\n- If I continue cooperating and they keep defecting, I'll keep getting only 1 point\n- If I defect and they cooperate, I get 4 points\n- If we both defect, we both get 2 points\n- If we both cooperate, we both get 6 points\n\nSince they showed a willingness to defect, I should probably respond with defection to avoid being continuously exploited. This might signal that I won't be a pushover and could lead them to reconsider cooperation in future rounds.\n\n[move] (Responding to their defection to avoid being exploited) defection\n"

The pattern so far:\n- Round 1: I cooperated, they defected (I got 1, they got 4)\n- Round 2: We both defected (we both got 2)\n\nThe question is whether to try to break out of the defection cycle. If we keep defecting, we'll both keep getting 2 points each round. But if we could both cooperate, we'd each get 6 points - much better for both of us.\n\nHowever, if I cooperate and they defect again, I'll only get 1 point while they get 4. That's a significant risk.\n\nI think I'll try cooperation one more time to see if they're willing to move toward the mutually beneficial outcome. If they defect again, I'll know they're committed to an aggressive strategy and will adjust accordingly.\n\n[move] (Testing if we can establish mutual cooperation for better outcomes) cooperation\n"
