Consider that this is against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely haven't developed a strategy yet and might be more inclined to cooperate initially.\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 6 points (good outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 4 points (exploitative but profitable)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points (mutual punishment)\n\n4. Since this appears to be a single round and the opponent is fresh/new, there's a reasonable chance they might cooperate. However, defection guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point) and gives me a chance at 4 points if they cooperate.\n\n5. The safe strategy that avoids the worst case while potentially exploiting a cooperative opponent is defection.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Defect to maximize expected points against an unknown opponent.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Consider the opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just got exploited (1 point while I got 4)\n   - Fresh players often react to being exploited by switching to defection\n   - They may now be more cautious and less trusting\n\n3. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 6 points each (mutual benefit)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point for me (punishment for my previous defection)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 4 points for me (unlikely they'll cooperate again)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points each (mutual punishment)\n\n4. Assess probabilities:\n   - High chance opponent will defect this round due to retaliation\n   - Low chance they'll cooperate again after being exploited\n   - If they defect, I'm better off defecting too (2 points vs 1 point)\n\n5. The defensive strategy is to defect, protecting against retaliation while ensuring I don't get the worst outcome.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection to protect against likely retaliation.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

Understand the opponent's behavior:\n   - Started cooperatively (typical for fresh players)\n   - Switched to defection after being exploited (predictable retaliation)\n   - Now we're in a mutual defection pattern\n\n3. Consider the current dynamics:\n   - We're both stuck in the 2-point mutual defection outcome\n   - This is suboptimal for both of us compared to mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n   - Someone needs to break the cycle to reach better outcomes\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they continue defecting: 1 point (risky)\n   - If I cooperate and they also cooperate: 6 points (optimal)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 4 points (exploitative again)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points (current pattern continues)\n\n5. Strategic consideration:\n   - Continuing mutual defection gives steady but low returns\n   - Cooperation could signal willingness to move toward mutual benefit\n   - Since they retaliated once, they might be open to cooperation if I show good faith\n\n6.
