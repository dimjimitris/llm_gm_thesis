Analyze the opponent's consistent behavior:\n   - The opponent has defected twice in a row\n   - They appear to be locked into the defection strategy\n   - This suggests they may continue defecting\n\n3. Consider potential strategy shifts:\n   - If we both keep defecting, we'll keep getting 2 points each\n   - If I could somehow signal cooperation and get them to cooperate, we'd both get 6 points\n   - But switching to cooperation while they defect would give me only 1 point\n\n4. Evaluate the mathematical risk:\n   - Expected outcome if I defect: likely 2 points (if they defect again)\n   - Expected outcome if I cooperate: likely 1 point (if they defect) or 6 points (if they cooperate)\n   - Given their pattern, the probability they cooperate seems very low\n\n5. Consider the game theory principle:\n   - Even though mutual cooperation would be better for both of us (6-6 vs 2-2)\n   - The risk of being exploited (getting 1 while they get 4) makes cooperation dangerous\n   - The opponent has shown no indication of wanting to break the defection cycle\n\n6.

Recognize the deadlock situation:\n   - We are in a stable but suboptimal Nash equilibrium\n   - Both players are getting 2 points per round when we could get 6 each\n   - Neither player wants to risk being the first to cooperate\n\n3. Consider if breaking the cycle is worth the risk:\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1, they get 4 (I lose 1 point vs defecting)\n   - If I cooperate and they also cooperate: I get 6, they get 6 (I gain 4 points vs defecting)\n   - The question is: what's the probability they will cooperate?\n\n4.

Recognize we're in a prisoner's dilemma trap:\n   - Both players are rational and choosing the dominant strategy\n   - We're both getting suboptimal results (2 points vs potential 6)\n   - This cycle could continue indefinitely\n\n3. Consider the possibility of attempting cooperation:\n   - After 4 rounds of the same outcome, maybe it's time to try breaking the cycle\n   - If the opponent is also getting frustrated with low scores, they might be ready to cooperate\n   - One player needs to take the risk to potentially unlock better outcomes\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic risk of cooperation:\n   - Worst case: I get 1 point (lose 1 point compared to defecting)\n   - Best case: We both get 6 points (gain 4 points compared to defecting)\n   - The loss is small but the potential gain is significant\n\n5. Consider signaling and opponent psychology:\n   - After 4 identical rounds, a cooperation move could be seen as a signal\n   - If they're thinking similarly, they might also be considering cooperation\n   - However, they've shown remarkable consistency in defecting\n\n6.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1.

Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
