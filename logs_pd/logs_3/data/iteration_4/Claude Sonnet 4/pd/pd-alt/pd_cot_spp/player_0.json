Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluate the current equilibrium:\n   - We're in a stable mutual defection pattern again\n   - Both getting 2 points per round consistently\n   - This mirrors the early game where we both played it safe\n   - Neither player is taking risks anymore\n\n4. Consider strategic options:\n   - Continue defecting: Guaranteed 2 points, safe and predictable\n   - Try cooperation: Risk of 1 point if exploited, potential 6 points if reciprocated\n   - Given opponent's history, they've shown willingness to exploit cooperation\n   - The evidence strongly suggests they'll defect if I cooperate\n\n5. Strategic conclusion:\n   - My opponent has established a clear pattern of exploiting cooperation\n   - Mutual defection at 2 points each is the stable, safe outcome\n   - While not optimal globally, it's the best I can achieve against this opponent\n   - Any deviation to cooperation has historically resulted in exploitation\n\n[move] (Continuing with defection as we've established a stable mutual defection equilibrium and opponent has consistently exploited cooperation attempts) defection\n"

Evaluate the game dynamics:\n   - The mutual defection equilibrium is stable but suboptimal\n   - Both players are getting 2 points when we could both get 6 with cooperation\n   - However, the history shows cooperation attempts lead to exploitation\n   - The trust needed for mutual cooperation appears to be broken\n\n4.

Strategic assessment:\n   - The stable mutual defection pattern is the Nash equilibrium for this situation\n   - Given the opponent's history of exploitation, cooperation remains risky\n   - While 6-6 would be better than 2-2, the evidence suggests it's unattainable\n   - Staying with the proven safe strategy makes the most sense\n\n[move] (Maintaining defection as we've established a stable three-round mutual defection pattern and historical evidence shows cooperation attempts are exploited) defection\n"
