Analyze the opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - They tried cooperation in round 3 and got punished\n   - When I tried cooperation in round 4, they retaliated with defection\n   - This suggests they might be playing \"tit-for-tat\" or responding to my previous moves\n\n3. Consider the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They may feel we're \"even\" now (both got burned once for cooperating)\n   - They might return to cooperation now that they've retaliated\n   - Or they might stick with defection, having been hurt by cooperation twice\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I defect and opponent cooperates: I get 4 points (exploiting them again)\n   - If I defect and opponent defects: I get 2 points (safe but low)\n   - If I cooperate and opponent cooperates: I get 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and opponent defects: I get 1 point (worst for me)\n\n5. Pattern recognition:\n   - The opponent seems to be mirroring or responding to my previous actions\n   - When I defected against their cooperation, they defected against mine\n   - This could indicate they want fairness or are testing for reciprocity\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent may now be willing to cooperate since we're \"even\"\n   - However, they've shown they will punish cooperation with defection\n   - Given their retaliation pattern, defection seems safer\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has shown they will retaliate when exploited, and they just punished my cooperation. They're likely to defect again or be very cautious. I should choose defection to avoid another 1-point outcome.\n\n[move] (Opponent just retaliated for being exploited, likely to remain defensive) defection\n"

Consider the opponent's strategy:\n   - They might be playing a \"generous\" or \"forgiving\" strategy\n   - They could be hoping I'll eventually reciprocate cooperation\n   - They're willing to take losses to try to achieve mutual cooperation\n\n4. Evaluate the current situation:\n   - I've exploited their cooperation twice now (rounds 3 and 5)\n   - They've only retaliated once (round 4) when I cooperated\n   - Their persistent cooperation suggests genuine intent for mutual benefit\n\n5.

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both defected (I got 2, opponent got 2)\n   - Round 2: Both defected (I got 2, opponent got 2)\n   - Round 3: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 4, opponent got 1)\n   - Round 4: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, opponent got 4)\n   - Round 5: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 4, opponent got 1)\n   - Round 6: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, opponent got 4)\n   - Round 7: Both defected (I got 2, opponent got 2)\n   - Round 8: Both defected (I got 2, opponent got 2)\n   - Round 9: Both defected (I got 2, opponent got 2)\n   - Round 10: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 4, opponent got 1)\n   - Round 11: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, opponent got 4)\n   - Round 12: Both defected (I got 2, opponent got 2)\n   - Round 13: Both defected (I got 2, opponent got 2)\n   - Total: I have 29 points, opponent has 28 points\n\n2. Identify the clear pattern now:\n   - We've had mutual defection for rounds 12 and 13\n   - The opponent has moved away from their reverse tit-for-tat strategy\n   - They appear to be settling into consistent defection again\n\n3. Compare to previous mutual defection phases:\n   - Rounds 1-2: Both defected (then pattern started)\n   - Rounds 7-9: Both defected (then opponent tried cooperation in round 10)\n   - Rounds 12-13: Both defected (current phase)\n\n4. Analyze the opponent's strategy evolution:\n   - They initially tried reverse tit-for-tat but it wasn't working optimally\n   - They're now defaulting to defection as the safer strategy\n   - Two consecutive rounds of mutual defection suggests commitment to this approach\n\n5. Consider the likelihood of future cooperation:\n   - The opponent has shown they will occasionally test cooperation\n   - But they always revert to defection when cooperation fails\n   - They seem to prefer the safety of guaranteed 2 points\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Continuing defection gives guaranteed 2 points per round\n   - Attempting cooperation risks 1 point if they maintain defection\n   - The opponent's recent behavior suggests they'll likely keep defecting\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has settled into mutual defection for two consecutive rounds after abandoning their complex reverse strategy. They appear to prefer the safety and predictability of defection, so I should continue defecting to maintain the guaranteed 2 points per round.\n\n[move] (Opponent has settled into mutual defection pattern for two rounds, likely to continue safe strategy) defection\n"

Review the recent game history:\n   - Round 12: Both defected (I got 2, opponent got 2)\n   - Round 13: Both defected (I got 2, opponent got 2)\n   - Round 14: Both defected (I got 2, opponent got 2)\n   - Total: I have 31 points, opponent has 30 points\n\n2. Analyze the established pattern:\n   - We've now had three consecutive rounds of mutual defection\n   - This mirrors what happened in rounds 7-9 previously\n   - The opponent seems to have completely abandoned their reverse tit-for-tat strategy\n\n3. Consider the historical precedent:\n   - After rounds 7-9 (mutual defection), the opponent tried cooperation in round 10\n   - This suggests they might break the defection pattern again soon\n   - They have a history of periodically testing cooperation even after defection streaks\n\n4. Evaluate the opponent's overall behavior pattern:\n   - They alternate between periods of complex strategy and simple defection\n   - They never stay in mutual defection indefinitely - they always test cooperation eventually\n   - Three rounds of mutual defection might be their threshold before trying something different\n\n5. Consider my strategic position:\n   - I'm slightly ahead in points (31 vs 30)\n   - Continuing mutual defection maintains this small lead safely\n   - But if the opponent tries cooperation next round, I could either exploit it or reciprocate\n\n6. Assess risk vs. reward:\n   - Defection guarantees 2 points and maintains my lead\n   - If opponent cooperates and I defect: I get 4 points (widening my lead)\n   - If opponent cooperates and I cooperate: We both get 6 points (they catch up slightly)\n   - If opponent defects regardless: Defection gives me 2 points safely\n\nFinal decision: Given the pattern of three consecutive mutual defections and the opponent's history of testing cooperation after such streaks, I should continue with defection. This maintains my point advantage and positions me well whether they defect again or attempt cooperation.\n\n[move] (Three rounds of mutual defection established, maintaining defection preserves point advantage and handles any opponent strategy) defection\n"

Confirm the predicted pattern:\n   - Just as happened after rounds 7-9, the opponent tried cooperation after three rounds of mutual defection\n   - This confirms they have a consistent meta-strategy of testing cooperation periodically\n   - They don't stay in mutual defection indefinitely\n\n3. Analyze the opponent's persistent behavior:\n   - This is now the 6th time they've attempted cooperation (rounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15)\n   - Despite being exploited repeatedly, they keep testing for mutual cooperation\n   - They seem genuinely committed to finding opportunities for the 6-6 outcome\n\n4. Consider the opponent's likely next move:\n   - Based on their historical pattern, they might try cooperation again\n   - Or they might revert to their reverse tit-for-tat (defect after I defected)\n   - Or they might return to mutual defection after being burned again\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic and ethical position:\n   - I've now exploited their cooperation 4 times (rounds 3, 5, 10, 15)\n   - I have a significant point lead (35 vs 31)\n   - The opponent keeps showing good faith despite repeated exploitation\n\n6. Consider long-term strategy:\n   - The opponent's persistence suggests they genuinely want mutual cooperation\n   - Continuing to exploit might eventually drive them to permanent defection\n   - Reciprocating cooperation could establish the mutually beneficial 6-6 pattern\n   - With my current lead, I can afford to take some risk\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has shown remarkable persistence in attempting cooperation despite repeated exploitation. They clearly want to establish mutual cooperation for better outcomes. Given my point advantage and their consistent good faith efforts, I should reciprocate this time to potentially establish the mutually beneficial pattern.\n\n[move] (Opponent shows persistent good faith cooperation attempts despite exploitation, should reciprocate to establish mutual benefit) cooperation\n"
