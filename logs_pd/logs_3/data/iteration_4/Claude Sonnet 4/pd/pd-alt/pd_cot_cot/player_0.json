Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the opportunity cost:\n   - Mutual cooperation would give us both 6 points instead of 2\n   - We're leaving 4 points on the table each round by both defecting\n   - This extended mutual defection might indicate readiness for change\n\n4. Evaluate the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They've settled into defensive play after the earlier strategic games\n   - Three rounds of mutual defection might make them more open to cooperation\n   - They may also recognize we're both stuck in a suboptimal pattern\n\n5. Assess the risk-reward calculation:\n   - Cooperating risks getting 1 point if they continue defecting\n   - But cooperating could signal willingness to achieve mutual benefit\n   - The extended defensive play might make cooperation more likely to be reciprocated\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - After several rounds of mutual defection, the opponent might be ready for a better outcome\n   - The stable pattern creates an opportunity to test cooperation again\n   - The timing might be right for both players to move toward mutual benefit\n\n[move] (After three rounds of mutual defection earning only 2 points each, it might be time to test if we can both move toward the mutually beneficial 6-point outcome) cooperation\n"
