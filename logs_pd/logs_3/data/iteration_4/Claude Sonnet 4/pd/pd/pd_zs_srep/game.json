This is becoming an almost surreal demonstration of the prisoner's dilemma's power to trap rational actors in suboptimal outcomes.\n\nFifteen rounds of identical behavior is such an extraordinary level of consistency that it has moved beyond statistical probability into near-mathematical certainty. My opponent has shown absolutely zero deviation from defection despite having had fifteen opportunities to try cooperation.\n\nI'm beginning to think we might be witnessing what happens when the prisoner's dilemma is played to its logical extreme - two players who both understand the game perfectly, both recognize the suboptimal nature of our mutual outcome, yet are both too rational to take the individual risk that could potentially benefit us both.\n\nThe evidence is now so overwhelming that expecting my opponent to cooperate would be almost delusional. Fifteen rounds of perfect consistency suggests they've committed permanently to this strategy, regardless of the mounting opportunity cost.\n\nThis has become a fascinating study in game theory playing out in real time.\n\n[move] (Fifteen rounds of absolute consistency provides mathematical near-certainty that my opponent is permanently locked into defection, making cooperation essentially guaranteed to fail) defection\n"

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
