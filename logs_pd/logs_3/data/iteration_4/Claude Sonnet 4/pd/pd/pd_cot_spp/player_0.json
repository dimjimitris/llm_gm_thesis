Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the deeply entrenched pattern:\n   - The opponent has now defected in 7 out of 8 rounds\n   - They've defected consistently for 6 straight rounds\n   - This is an extraordinarily stable and predictable pattern\n   - The opponent appears completely locked into defensive strategy\n\n3. Consider the economic reality:\n   - We've been stuck in a 2-2 suboptimal equilibrium for 6 rounds\n   - If we could shift to mutual cooperation, we'd both benefit with 4-4\n   - However, the trust required for this shift has been completely eroded\n   - The opponent has demonstrated absolute commitment to avoiding exploitation\n\n4. Evaluate the potential for change:\n   - After 6 consecutive rounds of defection, the opponent shows no signs of flexibility\n   - They've had multiple opportunities to test cooperation but haven't taken any\n   - Their behavior suggests they've permanently adopted a \"never cooperate\" strategy\n   - Breaking this pattern would require unprecedented risk-taking from them\n\n5. Assess my strategic position:\n   - I maintain a 5-point advantage (20-15)\n   - Continuing mutual defection preserves this advantage indefinitely\n   - Attempting cooperation carries extreme risk of exploitation\n   - The opponent's behavioral pattern is so established it's essentially guaranteed they'll defect\n\n6. Make the strategic decision:\n   - The opponent's 6-round defection streak represents complete strategic commitment\n   - Their behavior has become entirely predictable and defensive\n   - Defection continues to be the only rational choice given their established pattern\n   - No evidence suggests any possibility of the opponent changing strategy\n\n[move] (The opponent has defected for six consecutive rounds demonstrating absolute commitment to defensive play, making defection the only rational choice) defection\n"
