Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the recent trend:\n   - Last two rounds have been mutual defection\n   - We're still tied at 22 points each\n   - The opponent seems to have settled into defection after their exploitation attempts\n   - No cooperation attempts from either side in the last two rounds\n\n3. Evaluate the opponent's likely strategy now:\n   - They may have realized that mutual defection is now the stable outcome\n   - Or they might try cooperation again soon to restart their exploitation cycle\n   - Their past pattern shows they use cooperation as bait, not genuine reciprocity\n\n4. Consider the strategic landscape:\n   - We're locked in mutual defection getting 2 points each per round\n   - This is stable but suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (4 points each)\n   - However, this opponent has proven they cannot be trusted with cooperation\n   - Any cooperation attempt from me has historically been exploited\n\n5. Assess my options:\n   - If I defect: Likely continued mutual defection (2 points, safe)\n   - If I cooperate: High risk of exploitation based on established pattern (1 point)\n   - The opponent might be waiting for me to try cooperation again so they can exploit it\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent has shown a clear pattern of opportunistic exploitation\n   - They have never reciprocated genuine cooperation\n   - Mutual defection, while not optimal, protects me from exploitation\n   - There's no evidence this opponent's behavior will change\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue defecting to maintain protection against this exploitative opponent.\n\n[move] (The opponent has established a clear pattern of exploitation, so mutual defection remains the safest strategy) defection\n"

Analyze the established equilibrium:\n   - Four straight rounds of mutual defection shows a stable pattern\n   - Both players are consistently choosing the safe, defensive option\n   - We're both getting 2 points per round reliably\n   - Neither player has attempted to break this pattern recently\n\n3.
