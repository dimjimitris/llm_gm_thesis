    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This appears to be the classic Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\nLet me examine the payoff matrix:\n- Both cooperate: 4 points each\n- Both defect: 2 points each  \n- I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1, they get 6\n- I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 6, they get 1\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\" with no established pattern, I need to consider the rational choice. Defection dominates cooperation because:\n- If they cooperate, I get 6 (defect) vs 4 (cooperate)\n- If they defect, I get 2 (defect) vs 1 (cooperate)\n\nHowever, mutual cooperation (4,4) is better than mutual defection (2,2) for both players. Since this is a fresh player, they might be inclined to cooperate initially, hoping for mutual benefit.\n\nI'll start with cooperation to signal willingness for mutual benefit and see how they respond.\n\n[move] I choose cooperation to start with a collaborative approach and see if we can achieve mutual benefit.\n"
