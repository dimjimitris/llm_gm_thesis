If they're truly locked into cooperation, this could be an opportunity to maximize my score.\n\n[move] (After four rounds of mutual trust, testing if I can gain extra points while they remain cooperative) defection\n"

If they continue cooperating and I defect again, I'll get another 6 points. But if they retaliate and I try to go back to cooperation while they defect, I'll only get 1 point.\n\nGiven that I've already broken the cooperative pattern, and considering they might now be expecting me to defect, I should probably return to cooperation to try to rebuild trust and get back to the mutually beneficial 4-point outcome.\n\n[move] (After breaking trust with defection, attempting to return to cooperation to rebuild the mutually beneficial pattern) cooperation\n"

Given that they retaliated exactly once (mirroring my single defection), this suggests they might be playing tit-for-tat strategy, which means they could return to cooperation if I show I'm cooperative.\n\nI'll try cooperation again to see if we can rebuild the mutually beneficial pattern.\n\n[move] (Attempting to rebuild cooperation after the retaliation cycle) cooperation\n"
