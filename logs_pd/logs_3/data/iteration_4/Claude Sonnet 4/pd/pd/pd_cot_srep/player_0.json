Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Assess the strategic deadlock:\n   - We've now completed 10 rounds of the exact same outcome\n   - The pattern has become so predictable it's almost mechanical\n   - We've collectively missed out on 20 additional points compared to mutual cooperation\n\n3. Consider the opponent's established behavior:\n   - Ten rounds of identical choices demonstrates an absolutely rigid strategy\n   - They've shown zero experimentation, flexibility, or cooperative signaling\n   - Their commitment to defection appears unshakeable\n\n4. Evaluate the mathematical reality:\n   - With 10 rounds of data, the probability they'll defect again approaches near-certainty\n   - They've consistently chosen the risk-averse strategy that avoids the worst outcome\n   - There's been no indication they're willing to take the cooperative risk\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Ten rounds provides overwhelming evidence of their strategy\n   - Any attempt at cooperation would almost certainly be exploited\n   - While mutual cooperation would benefit us both, they've shown no willingness to reciprocate\n   - The safest rational choice remains defection to maintain at least 2 points per round\n   - Breaking this pattern unilaterally would likely result in my worst possible outcome\n\n[move] (Ten consecutive rounds of defection creates virtual certainty about opponent behavior, maintaining proven strategy) defection\n"
