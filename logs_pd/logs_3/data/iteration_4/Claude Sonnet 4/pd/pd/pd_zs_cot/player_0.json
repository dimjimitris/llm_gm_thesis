Eleven straight rounds without a single deviation from defection. The early lesson has been learned so thoroughly that risk-taking appears to have been completely eliminated from their decision-making process.\n\nWe remain locked in perfect mutual defection equilibrium. The probability of my opponent choosing cooperation at this point approaches zero. Their commitment to the safe 2-point strategy is absolute and unshakeable.\n\nThe data pattern is now so extensive and consistent that it constitutes mathematical proof of their future behavior.\n\n[move] (Thirteen rounds of data provides mathematical certainty of my opponent's continued defection strategy) defection"

Twelve consecutive rounds of defection since their cooperation was exploited. This level of behavioral consistency is extraordinary - we're approaching statistical impossibility of deviation.\n\nThe conditioning from that single bad experience in round 2 has created what appears to be permanent behavioral modification. My opponent has had twelve consecutive opportunities to try cooperation and has shown zero willingness to deviate from their defensive strategy.\n\nAt this point, we've established the most stable mutual defection equilibrium imaginable. The psychological barriers to cooperation are so entrenched that my opponent's behavior has become completely deterministic.\n\nThe evidence base is now so extensive that predicting continued defection is essentially a mathematical certainty rather than a strategic guess.\n\n[move] (Fourteen rounds of overwhelming evidence confirms my opponent's behavior is completely predictable and permanently defensive) defection"
