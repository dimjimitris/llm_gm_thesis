Analyze my opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - Perfect defection record: 11 out of 11 rounds\n   - Exploited my single cooperation attempt without hesitation\n   - Shows no signs of strategic variation or willingness to cooperate\n   - Maintains consistent defection even after gaining advantage\n\n3. Evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - I'm still 5 points behind from my cooperation attempt\n   - My opponent has proven to be a pure defector\n   - No evidence suggests they will ever change their strategy\n   - They appear committed to individual point maximization regardless of mutual benefit\n\n4. Consider potential alternatives:\n   - Another cooperation attempt would almost certainly be exploited again\n   - Defection guarantees steady 2 points per round\n   - There's no realistic path to catching up through cooperation given opponent's behavior\n   - The best I can do is prevent further losses\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - My opponent's behavior is entirely predictable at this point\n   - Defection is the only rational response to a pure defector\n   - I must focus on damage control rather than attempting to build cooperation\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue defecting as my opponent has established an unwavering pattern of defection and exploitation.\n\n[move] (Eleven consecutive rounds of defection including exploiting my cooperation shows my opponent is completely committed to defection, leaving me no choice but to defect) defection\n"
