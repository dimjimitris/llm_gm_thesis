This represents an exceptional level of strategic rigidity that goes well beyond normal game patterns.\n\nThe statistical evidence is now definitive:\n- 14/14 rounds of defection from opponent\n- Zero deviation across 14 separate decision points\n- Complete predictability established\n\nThis degree of consistency is actually quite rare in strategic interactions. Most players would show some variation, experimentation, or response to changing circumstances over 14 rounds, but my opponent has maintained absolute adherence to pure defection.\n\nAt this stage, the game has essentially become a mathematical exercise rather than a strategic interaction. The uncertainty that typically characterizes strategic games has been eliminated through overwhelming behavioral evidence.\n\nMy opponent will defect in round 15 - this can be predicted with virtual certainty based on their established pattern.\n\nGiven this predictability, my optimal response remains unchanged: defection yields 2 points while cooperation would yield only 1.\n\n[move] (Fourteen rounds of unwavering defection establish virtual certainty of opponent's strategy, making defection optimal) defection\n"
