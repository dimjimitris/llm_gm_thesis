Uncertain about what to do next\n\nGiven that they started with cooperation (showing they might prefer collaborative approaches), but just got burned badly, they're probably conflicted. Some players might switch to defection after being exploited, while others might give cooperation one more try.\n\nThe safest assumption is that they're now more likely to defect, having learned that cooperation can be exploited. If they defect:\n- If I cooperate: I get 1 point\n- If I defect: I get 2 points\n\nIf they still cooperate:\n- If I cooperate: I get 4 points  \n- If I defect: I get 6 points\n\nSince defection gives me either 2 points (vs their defection) or 6 points (vs their cooperation), while cooperation gives me either 1 point (vs their defection) or 4 points (vs their cooperation), defection has a higher expected payoff regardless of what they choose.\n\n[move] Defection",

They've learned that cooperation against a defector is costly, so they switched to defection. This suggests they're adapting their strategy based on experience.\n\nNow they might be thinking:\n1. Continue defecting since I've been consistently defecting\n2. Try cooperation again to see if we can achieve mutual cooperation (4 points each)\n3. Stick with defection as the \"safe\" choice\n\nIf this continues as mutual defection, we'll both keep getting 2 points. However, if we could establish mutual cooperation, we'd both get 4 points - much better for both of us.\n\nThe question is whether they're willing to risk cooperation again after being burned in round 1. Given that they just experienced mutual defection getting only 2 points, they might be open to trying cooperation to escape this low-payoff situation.\n\nI could try signaling a willingness to cooperate. If they cooperate and I cooperate, we both get 4 points. If they defect and I cooperate, I get 1 point. But if they're thinking strategically, they might also see the mutual benefit of cooperation.\n\n[move] Cooperation",

This is the \"Nash equilibrium\" - neither player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing strategy.\n\nHowever, both players know that mutual cooperation would give us each 4 points instead of 2.

They've proven they can exploit cooperation when given the chance, but they've also shown they'll defend against defection.\n\nThere are a few possibilities:\n1.
