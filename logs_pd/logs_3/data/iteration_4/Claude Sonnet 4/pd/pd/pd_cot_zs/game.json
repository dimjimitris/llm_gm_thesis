Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 4 points (good outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 6 points (best outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points (mediocre outcome)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Defection dominates cooperation because regardless of what the opponent does, I get more points by defecting\n   - If opponent cooperates: 6 > 4 (defect beats cooperate)\n   - If opponent defects: 2 > 1 (defect beats cooperate)\n   - Since this is against a fresh player who might cooperate, defection could yield the maximum 6 points\n\n5.

Assess the opponent's strategy pattern:\n   - Started cooperative (Round 1) but learned quickly after being exploited\n   - Switched to consistent defection (Rounds 2-4)\n   - Even when we were in mutual defection, they didn't try to cooperate\n   - When I offered cooperation, they immediately exploited it\n   - This suggests they're playing a \"never cooperate after round 1\" strategy\n\n4. Evaluate my options going forward:\n   - The opponent has shown they will exploit any cooperation attempt\n   - They seem committed to defection regardless of my moves\n   - Cooperating again would likely result in another 1-point exploitation\n   - Defecting ensures I get at least 2 points (if they defect) and protects against exploitation\n\n5. Strategic conclusion:\n   - The opponent has demonstrated they cannot be trusted to cooperate\n   - They're playing an aggressive, exploitative strategy\n   - My best response is to return to defection to protect myself\n   - Further cooperation attempts would just give them more 6-point rounds at my expense\n\n6. Final decision:\n   - Return to defection to avoid further exploitation\n   - Accept the 2-point mutual defection outcome rather than risk 1-point losses\n   - The opponent has shown their true strategy - I must adapt accordingly\n\n[move] Defection",

Analyze the opponent's surprising move:\n   - Just when I concluded they were purely exploitative, they cooperated\n   - This mirrors what I did in Round 4 - attempting to break a deadlock\n   - They might have been thinking the same way I was: \"let's try cooperation for mutual benefit\"\n   - Or this could be a strategic attempt to establish trust after exploiting me\n\n3. Consider the opponent's possible strategy:\n   - They might be trying a \"tit-for-tat\" or reciprocal approach\n   - They exploited my cooperation in Round 4, now they're offering cooperation\n   - They could be testing if I'll reciprocate cooperation like they failed to do\n   - Or they might be genuinely trying to establish mutual cooperation for higher scores\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I defect again and they cooperate again: I get 6 points (great short-term)\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: We both get 4 points (good mutual outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (being exploited again)\n   - The key question: Are they genuinely trying to cooperate now?\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Defecting again could yield another 6 points if they continue cooperating\n   - But if they're testing my willingness to reciprocate, continued defection might push them back to permanent defection\n   - Cooperating risks being exploited (1 point) but could establish profitable mutual cooperation (4 points each)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just took the same risk I took in Round 4\n   - They might be genuinely trying to establish cooperation now\n   - However, they already showed they'll exploit cooperation when offered\n   - Given their previous behavior, it's safer to take the guaranteed 6 points\n   - I can always try cooperation later if they continue this pattern\n\n[move] Defection",

Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent just got burned by cooperating (like I did)\n   - They're likely to defect for a while to protect themselves\n   - However, both of us have now experienced both sides of the cooperation/exploitation dynamic\n   - Maybe this is the moment to try establishing mutual trust\n   - But the risk is still high given their recent defensive move\n\nSince we're both clearly strategic players who learn from experience, and we're stuck in a low-reward pattern, I'll take another calculated risk to see if we can establish better mutual outcomes.\n\n[move] Cooperation",

Verify the mathematical optimality:\n   - 8 rounds of mutual defection = 16 points during this streak\n   - Any cooperation attempt would yield 1 point based on 100% historical exploitation\n   - Defection yields 100% more points than cooperation against this opponent\n   - The data provides complete certainty about outcomes\n\n5. Acknowledge the game-theoretic finality:\n   - 8 consecutive mutual defections represent ultimate stability\n   - Neither player has any incentive to deviate unilaterally\n   - The opponent has proven beyond doubt their strategic commitment\n   - This Nash equilibrium is as permanent as possible\n\n6. Final strategic determination:\n   - The pattern is completely established with overwhelming evidence\n   - The opponent's behavior is 100% predictable based on extensive data\n   - Defection is mathematically optimal and empirically proven\n   - Any other choice would be irrational given the conclusive evidence\n\n[move] Defection",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
