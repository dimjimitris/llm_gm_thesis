Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - Defection dominates cooperation from a pure self-interest perspective\n   - If I defect: I get either 6 points (if opponent cooperates) or 2 points (if opponent defects)\n   - If I cooperate: I get either 4 points (if opponent cooperates) or 1 point (if opponent defects)\n   - Defecting guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point)\n\n3. Consider the opponent is \"fresh\" (new player):\n   - They may not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet\n   - They might be inclined to cooperate initially as it seems \"fair\"\n   - This could be an opportunity to gain maximum points\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Cooperating risks getting only 1 point if they defect\n   - Defecting guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 6\n   - The potential gain from defecting (6 vs 4) outweighs the mutual cooperation benefit\n\nFinal decision: Given that this is against a fresh player who might cooperate, and defection provides both higher maximum reward and better minimum guarantee, I should defect.\n\n[move] Defection\n"
