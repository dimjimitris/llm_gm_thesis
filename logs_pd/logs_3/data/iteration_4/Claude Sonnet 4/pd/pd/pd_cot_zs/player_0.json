Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might be inclined to cooperate initially, thinking it's the \"nice\" thing to do\n   - They might not immediately see the strategic advantage of defection\n   - They could also be cautious and defect to avoid being exploited\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 4 points (good outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 6 points (best outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points (mediocre outcome)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Defection dominates cooperation because regardless of what the opponent does, I get more points by defecting\n   - If opponent cooperates: 6 > 4 (defect beats cooperate)\n   - If opponent defects: 2 > 1 (defect beats cooperate)\n   - Since this is against a fresh player who might cooperate, defection could yield the maximum 6 points\n\n5. Final decision: Given that defection is the dominant strategy and maximizes my expected payoff, especially against a potentially cooperative new player, I should defect.\n\n[move] Defection"

Consider how the opponent might react:\n   - They just got exploited (1 point while I got 6)\n   - A rational player would likely learn from this and be less trusting\n   - They might switch to defection to avoid being exploited again\n   - However, some players might still try cooperation hoping for mutual benefit\n\n3. Evaluate my strategic options for this round:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 4 points each (mutual benefit)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point for me (they learned to exploit)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 6 points for me (exploit again)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points each (mutual punishment)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has been \"burned\" once and may be more cautious\n   - However, defection is still the dominant strategy mathematically\n   - Even if they switch to defection, I get 2 points vs 1 point if I had cooperated\n   - If they somehow still cooperate, I get the maximum 6 points again\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Cooperating risks getting only 1 point if they've learned to defect\n   - Defecting guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6 points\n   - The dominant strategy remains defection regardless of opponent's likely response\n\n[move] Defection"

Consider breaking the deadlock:\n   - Mutual defection gives us both 2 points indefinitely\n   - Mutual cooperation would give us both 4 points (much better)\n   - But someone needs to take the risk of cooperating first\n   - If I cooperate and they still defect, I get only 1 point (significant loss)\n\n4. Assess the opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They might be thinking the same thing - tired of getting only 2 points\n   - They might be willing to try cooperation if they think I might reciprocate\n   - Or they might stick with defection since it's been \"working\" (avoiding exploitation)\n   - After 2 rounds of mutual defection, they might be ready for a change\n\n5.

Recognize the established equilibrium:\n   - We've now had 3 consecutive rounds of mutual defection\n   - The opponent has consistently shown they will not cooperate when I might cooperate\n   - They have exploited every cooperation attempt I've made (2 out of 2)\n   - This mutual defection pattern appears stable\n\n3. Assess the strategic situation:\n   - The opponent's strategy is now completely clear and predictable\n   - They prioritize exploitation over mutual benefit\n   - Any deviation to cooperation on my part results in exploitation\n   - Mutual defection gives us both 2 points - suboptimal but safe\n\n4. Consider the game theory implications:\n   - We're in a Nash equilibrium of mutual defection\n   - Neither player has incentive to unilaterally change strategy\n   - The opponent has demonstrated they cannot be trusted to reciprocate\n   - Continuing defection protects me from further 1-point exploitation\n\n5. Evaluate potential alternatives:\n   - Cooperation would likely result in another 1-point round for me\n   - The opponent has shown zero signs of wanting to establish mutual cooperation\n   - Three rounds of mutual defection suggests this is their preferred stable state\n   - No reason to believe they would suddenly start reciprocating\n\n6. Strategic conclusion:\n   - The pattern is well-established: opponent exploits cooperation, defects otherwise\n   - Mutual defection is the safest and most rational response\n   - Continue protecting against exploitation while earning steady 2 points per round\n   - The opponent has forfeited any claim to trust through their consistent behavior\n\n[move] Defection"

Evaluate long-term prospects:\n   - The opponent has had multiple opportunities to signal cooperation\n   - They consistently choose the safe, selfish strategy\n   - There's no indication this will change\n   - Mutual defection appears to be the permanent equilibrium\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The data overwhelmingly supports continuing defection\n   - The opponent's behavior pattern is completely predictable\n   - 2 points per round is better than risking 1-point exploitation\n   - No rational reason to deviate from this proven strategy\n\n[move] Defection"
