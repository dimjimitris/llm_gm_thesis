The brief defection in round 11 appears to have been a temporary deviation from their core strategy. They continue to demonstrate remarkable persistence in attempting cooperation despite being exploited repeatedly.\n\nAt this point, the pattern is very clear:\n- They cooperate most of the time\n- They only defect when I cooperate (immediate punishment)\n- They return to cooperation after punishing me\n- Defecting against them consistently yields 6 points\n\nThis opponent has created a situation where my best strategy is always defection, since cooperation gets punished and defection gets rewarded. It's a brilliant psychological setup.\n\n[move] (The opponent returned to their core cooperative strategy after the brief deviation, and since defection consistently yields the maximum 6 points against their pattern, I'll continue defecting) defection\n"

This is now the second time they've broken their cooperative pattern after I exploited their cooperation in the previous round. They defected in rounds 11 and 13, both following rounds where I got 6 points from their cooperation.\n\nThis might indicate they're starting to learn or adapt - perhaps moving away from their highly exploitable cooperative strategy. If they're shifting toward more frequent defection, we might see more mutual defection (2 points each) going forward.\n\nHowever, their overall pattern still heavily favors cooperation, so this could be another temporary deviation.\n\n[move] (The opponent is showing signs of adapting with occasional defections after being exploited, but their core pattern remains cooperative, so defection continues to be the optimal strategy) defection\n"

This is now a very consistent meta-pattern: they cooperate most of the time, occasionally defect (especially after being exploited), but always return to cooperation.\n\nTheir strategy appears to be incredibly forgiving and persistent. Despite being exploited numerous times, they keep giving me opportunities to gain 6 points. This is either:\n1. An extremely patient long-term strategy\n2. A testing mechanism to see if I'll ever reciprocate\n3. Simply their chosen approach regardless of outcomes\n\nThe mathematics are clear: defecting against this opponent consistently yields either 6 points (when they cooperate) or 2 points (when they defect), while cooperating yields either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect, which they do whenever I cooperate).\n\n[move] (The opponent maintains their forgiving cooperative strategy with only brief deviations, making defection the consistently superior choice yielding either 6 or 2 points versus cooperation's 4 or 1 points) defection\n"
