Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Pattern change analysis:\n   - The opponent broke their previous pattern in round 9\n   - Previously: when I defected, they cooperated (rounds 2, 6, 8)\n   - Round 9: when I defected, they also defected\n   - This suggests they may have adapted their strategy\n\n3. Possible reasons for the opponent's change:\n   - They realized their cooperative responses were being exploited\n   - They may have switched to a more defensive strategy\n   - They might be trying to establish mutual defection as the new equilibrium\n   - Or this could be a one-time adjustment before returning to their pattern\n\n4. Strategic considerations for round 10:\n   - If they continue with defection, we both get 2 points (mutual defection)\n   - If they return to cooperation and I defect, I get 6 points\n   - If they defect and I cooperate, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - If we both cooperate, we both get 4 points\n\n5. Decision analysis:\n   - The opponent has shown they can adapt their strategy\n   - Defection remains the safer choice to avoid being exploited\n   - If they've truly switched to pure defection, we'll both get 2 points\n   - If they're still willing to cooperate occasionally, defection maximizes my potential gain\n\n[move] (The opponent broke their pattern and may have adapted their strategy, so I'll maintain defection to stay protected while maximizing potential gains) defection\n"

Pattern analysis confirmation:\n   - The opponent has returned to their previous behavior\n   - Round 9 appears to have been an anomaly or brief strategy test\n   - They're back to cooperating when I defect (rounds 2, 6, 8, 10)\n   - The underlying pattern seems to be: they cooperate after I defect\n\n3. Strategic assessment:\n   - The opponent's strategy appears largely predictable again\n   - They consistently give me 6 points when I defect\n   - When I've cooperated in the past, they exploited me (rounds 5, 7)\n   - Round 9 was the only time they defected when I defected\n\n4. Risk-reward evaluation:\n   - Continuing to defect: likely to get 6 points if they cooperate again\n   - Switching to cooperation: high risk of getting 1 point based on past exploitation\n   - The opponent has shown they prefer to exploit cooperation rather than reciprocate it\n   - My defection strategy has been highly successful (6 points in 4 out of 10 rounds)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has returned to their exploitable pattern\n   - There's no evidence they've learned to avoid being exploited\n   - Defection continues to be the dominant strategy against this opponent\n   - The risk of cooperation far outweighs any potential benefit\n\n[move] (The opponent returned to their predictable pattern of cooperating when I defect, so I'll continue with the strategy that consistently gives me 6 points) defection\n"
