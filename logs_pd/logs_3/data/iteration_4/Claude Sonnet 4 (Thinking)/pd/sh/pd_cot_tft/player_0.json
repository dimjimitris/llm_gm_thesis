Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix: \n   - Stag vs Stag: Both get 6 (best mutual outcome)\n   - Hare vs Hare: Both get 2 (safe mutual outcome) \n   - Stag vs Hare: I get 1, other gets 4 (bad for me)\n   - Hare vs Stag: I get 4, other gets 1 (good for me)\n\n2. Consider the risk: If I choose stag, I either get 6 (if other chooses stag) or only 1 (if other chooses hare).\n\n3. Consider the safety: If I choose hare, I either get 4 (if other chooses stag) or 2 (if other chooses hare).\n\n4. Evaluate opponent: Playing against a \"fresh player\" suggests they may not understand the cooperative strategy of mutual stag selection, and might play defensively or opportunistically.\n\n5. Risk assessment: The worst outcome from choosing hare is 2 points, while the worst outcome from choosing stag is 1 point. The potential upside from hare (4 points) is also significant if the fresh player chooses stag.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player who may not grasp the cooperative strategy, the safer and potentially more rewarding choice is hare.\n\n[move] hare"

This shows the other player is playing somewhat defensively or cautiously.\n\n2. Consider the other player's likely reasoning: They might think I'm also playing defensively since I chose hare. This could lead them to try to exploit this by switching to stag.\n\n3. Evaluate the strategic shift: After a mutual hare round, there's often a temptation for players to switch to stag to try to gain the 4-point advantage, especially if they think their opponent will stick with the \"safe\" hare choice.\n\n4. Calculate the outcomes if I choose stag:\n   - If they choose stag too: We both get 6 points (excellent outcome)\n   - If they choose hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 (bad for me)\n\n5. Calculate the outcomes if I choose hare again:\n   - If they choose stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 (good for me)\n   - If they choose hare: We both get 2 points (safe but low)\n\n6. Strategic reasoning: Given that we both played conservatively in round 1, the other player might expect me to continue with hare and try to exploit this with stag.

Analyze opponent's pattern: The opponent played hare both times - once defensively when we both played it, and once exploitatively when I switched to stag.\n\n4. Consider opponent's likely thinking: They successfully exploited my stag choice and might expect me to either:\n   - Try stag again (hoping for cooperation this time)\n   - Return to the \"safe\" hare choice after being burned\n\n5. Evaluate the risk: If they think I might try stag again to achieve the mutual 6-point benefit, they could stick with hare to exploit me a second time.\n\n6.

Consider the strategic significance: Since we're tied, the opponent's switch to stag might be them trying to establish mutual cooperation for the 6-6 outcome, which is the best joint result.\n\n5. Evaluate the risk vs reward:\n   - If I match their stag and they continue: 6 points each (excellent)\n   - If I match their stag but they switch back to hare: 1 point for me (bad)\n   - If I play hare and they stick with stag: 4 points for me (good but prevents cooperation)\n\n6.

Analyze opponent's likely reasoning: They've successfully established this counter-pattern and might expect it to continue.

Calculate optimal response: If they choose stag (following counter-strategy) and I choose hare, I get 4 points and they get 1 point, which would extend my lead to 4 points.\n\n7. Strategic reasoning: Since I'm only ahead by 1 point and they've returned to their counter-strategy, I should exploit this predictable pattern.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 2-7: Counter-strategy pattern\n   - Rounds 8-9: Mutual hare cooperation\n   - Round 10: I tested stag cooperation, they exploited with hare\n   - Round 11: I chose hare, they chose stag (seemed like counter-strategy return)\n   - Round 12: I chose hare, they chose hare (cooperation signal again)\n\n2. Calculate current scores: I have 28 points, opponent has 27 points. I'm ahead by 1 point.\n\n3. Identify the mixed strategy: The opponent is no longer following a predictable pattern. They're mixing between cooperation, counter-strategy, and exploitation, making them harder to predict.\n\n4. Analyze the latest move: In round 12, I expected them to counter my hare with stag (continuing the counter-pattern from round 11), but they matched with hare instead.\n\n5. Evaluate the cooperation signal: This matching hare choice could indicate they want to return to safe cooperation, especially since the score is very close.\n\n6. Consider the risk/reward: With only a 1-point lead, taking risks with stag could backfire. The safe hare cooperation gives us both 2 points and maintains my slight advantage.\n\n7. Strategic reasoning: Given the close score and their apparent return to cooperation signaling, I should continue with the safe cooperation strategy.\n\n[move] hare"

Calculate current scores: I have 30 points, opponent has 29 points. I'm ahead by 1 point.\n\n3. Identify the cooperative trend: The opponent has chosen to cooperate with hare matching in 3 of the last 5 rounds, suggesting they may prefer stable cooperation over risky exploitation.\n\n4. Analyze the strategic position: With such a close score (30-29), maintaining my 1-point lead is crucial. The safe hare cooperation preserves this advantage without risk.\n\n5. Evaluate alternatives: Testing stag for higher cooperation (6-6) is tempting, but the opponent has shown they'll exploit cooperation attempts (round 10), which would cost me the lead.\n\n6. Consider opponent's likely reasoning: They're only 1 point behind and may prefer the safe hare strategy to avoid falling further behind, rather than risk getting only 1 point if I play hare to their stag.\n\n7. Strategic decision: With such a tight score and recent cooperative behavior, maintaining the safe cooperation strategy protects my lead.\n\n[move] hare"

Calculate current scores: I have 32 points, opponent has 31 points. I'm ahead by 1 point.\n\n3. Evaluate the established pattern: We've now settled into a stable hare-hare cooperation pattern after all the earlier volatility. Both players seem comfortable with this safe strategy.\n\n4. Consider the risk of change: Breaking this cooperation streak by choosing stag could:\n   - Lead to mutual stag cooperation (6-6) if they trust me\n   - Lead to exploitation (1-4) if they stick with hare, costing me the lead\n\n5. Analyze opponent's likely mindset: After 4 consecutive cooperative rounds, they may expect this pattern to continue and be prepared to exploit any stag attempt.\n\n6. Strategic assessment: With only a 1-point lead in what appears to be a close, extended game, maintaining the safe cooperation strategy preserves my advantage without unnecessary risk.\n\n7.

Calculate current scores: I have 34 points, opponent has 33 points. I'm ahead by 1 point.\n\n3. Evaluate the cooperation signal: Five consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation is a very strong signal that the opponent may be genuinely committed to cooperative play rather than exploitation.\n\n4. Consider the potential for higher-value cooperation: The hare-hare cooperation (2-2) is safe but suboptimal. The stag-stag cooperation (6-6) would be much better for both players.\n\n5. Assess the risk: If I test stag and they exploit with hare, I get 1 point and lose my lead (they'd be ahead 37-35). But if they cooperate with stag, we both get 6 points and maintain the close competition.\n\n6. Analyze the strategic moment: After 5 rounds of stable cooperation, this might be the right time to test if we can upgrade to the mutually beneficial stag-stag outcome.\n\n7. Decision rationale: The extended cooperation streak suggests genuine cooperative intent, making this a reasonable time to test for higher-value cooperation.\n\n[move] stag"
