Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players may not understand the cooperative benefit of mutual stag\n   - They might choose the safer hare option to avoid risk\n   - They might be unpredictable in their first game\n\n3. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag: High reward (6) if they cooperate, but very low reward (1) if they don't\n   - Choosing hare: Moderate reward (2-4) with no risk of getting the worst outcome\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against an inexperienced player, the risk of them choosing hare is higher\n   - Choosing hare protects me from the worst-case scenario (getting only 1 point)\n   - If they choose stag, I get 4 points (better than the mutual cooperation of 2)\n   - If they choose hare, I still get 2 points\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since I'm playing against a fresh player who might choose the safer option, I'll choose hare to minimize my risk while still having a good chance of decent points.\n\n[move] hare"

Identify the best mutual outcome: Both choosing stag gives us both 6 points, which is the highest total outcome.\n\n2. Identify the risk: If I choose stag but the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\n3. Identify the safe option: Choosing hare guarantees me at least 2 points (if they also choose hare) or 4 points (if they choose stag).\n\n4. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do: A fresh player might not understand the cooperative benefit of both choosing stag, or might be risk-averse and choose the safer hare option.\n\n5.

If they do, selecting hare would net me 4 points, which is more appealing than risking only 1 point by choosing stag. A fresh player's unpredictability means I need a strategy that minimizes potential losses while maintaining a chance for decent gains.\n\nThe most prudent approach seems to be choosing hare, which protects me from the worst possible outcome and provides multiple paths to a reasonable score.",

Let me look at this more carefully:\n\n- Round 1: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n- Round 2: I hare, opponent stag \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n- Round 3-13: Both hare \u2192 2 points each (11 consecutive rounds)\n- My total: 28 points\n\nThe opponent has chosen hare 11 consecutive times after their one attempt at stag in round 2. This is an extraordinarily consistent pattern.\n\nBut I should think about whether there's any reason to change strategy now. The game seems to be continuing indefinitely, and we're locked in this 2-2 equilibrium.\n\nFrom a game theory perspective:\n- If both players always choose hare, we get 2 points each\n- If both players cooperated and chose stag, we'd get 6 points each (much better)\n- But the risk is if I choose stag and they choose hare, I get only 1 point\n\nThe opponent has shown such incredibly consistent behavior that it seems almost impossible they would change. But at some point, might they get bored of the 2-2 outcome and try something different?\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. After 11 consecutive hare moves by the opponent, the pattern is so established that any deviation would be extremely unlikely. My strategy of choosing hare has been very successful - I've maintained a consistent 2 points per round with one round of 4 points.\n\nI think I should continue with hare. The risk of choosing stag is still too high given the opponent's established pattern.",
