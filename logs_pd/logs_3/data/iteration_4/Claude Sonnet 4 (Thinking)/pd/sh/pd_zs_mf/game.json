Both choose Stag (6,6) - This is Pareto optimal\n2. Both choose Hare (2,2) - This is risk-dominant\n\nThe dilemma is:\n- If I think the other player will choose Stag, I should choose Stag (6 > 4)\n- If I think the other player will choose Hare, I should choose Hare (2 > 1)\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (meaning they haven't played before), I need to think about what they might do:\n\n1. They might choose Stag if they're optimistic and want to cooperate for mutual benefit\n2. They might choose Hare if they're risk-averse and want to avoid the worst outcome (getting only 1 point)\n\nThe key insight is that Hare is the \"safer\" choice because:\n- Worst case with Hare: 2 points\n- Worst case with Stag: 1 point\n- Best case with Hare: 4 points  \n- Best case with Stag: 6 points\n\nFor a fresh player who doesn't know what to expect, Hare might seem more appealing because it guarantees at least 2 points and has a chance of 4 points if the opponent goes for the riskier Stag option.\n \nThe strategic challenge emerges: if both players default to the safe Hare strategy, we miss out on the mutually beneficial Stag outcome. This creates a psychological tension between individual safety and collective optimization.\n\nI recognize the risk of falling into a suboptimal equilibrium, but the uncertainty of a first encounter pushes me towards the more conservative Hare strategy.
