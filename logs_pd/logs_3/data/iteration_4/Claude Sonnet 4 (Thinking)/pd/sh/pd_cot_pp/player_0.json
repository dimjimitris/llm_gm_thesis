    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both stag: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Both hare: 2 points each (safe outcome)\n   - I pick stag, they pick hare: I get 1, they get 4 (worst for me)\n   - I pick hare, they pick stag: I get 4, they get 1 (good for me)\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - They may not understand the coordination benefits\n   - They might choose the safer option (hare) to avoid the risk of getting only 1 point\n   - They might try to exploit by choosing hare hoping I choose stag\n\n3. Evaluate my risk vs reward:\n   - Stag: High reward (6) but high risk (could get only 1)\n   - Hare: Guaranteed minimum of 2, with potential for 4\n\n4. Since I'm playing against someone inexperienced who likely doesn't know my strategy, and this appears to be a single round, the safer choice is hare. This protects me from the worst-case scenario while still giving me a chance at 4 points if they choose stag.\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to minimize risk against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] hare"

Consider what this reveals about the other player:\n   - They're cautious and risk-averse (chose the safer option)\n   - They didn't try to exploit me by choosing hare hoping I'd pick stag\n   - This suggests they might be thinking strategically too\n\n3. Evaluate the new situation:\n   - Since we both played conservatively last round, they might now consider that mutual cooperation (both stag) gives us both 6 points instead of 2\n   - There's a chance they're thinking about switching to stag for the better mutual outcome\n   - But they might also stick with the safe hare strategy\n\n4. Calculate the risk vs reward for this round:\n   - If I choose stag and they also switch to stag: we both get 6 (excellent)\n   - If I choose stag and they stick with hare: I get 1 (bad)\n   - If I choose hare: guaranteed 2 or 4, but miss chance for 6\n\n5. Given their cautious behavior last round, I think there's a reasonable chance they might be thinking about coordination now.
