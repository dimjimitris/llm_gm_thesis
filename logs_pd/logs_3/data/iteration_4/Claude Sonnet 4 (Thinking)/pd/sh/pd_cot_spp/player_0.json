Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Stag vs Stag: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Hare vs Hare: 2 points each (safe mutual outcome)  \n   - Mixed outcomes: One player gets 4, the other gets 1\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - They may not immediately understand the coordination aspect\n   - They might choose the safer option to avoid the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Fresh players often play defensively in their first rounds\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - Choosing Stag: High reward (6) if we coordinate, but risky (1) if they choose Hare\n   - Choosing Hare: Safer floor (2) with potential upside (4) if they choose Stag\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against an inexperienced player, the probability they choose Hare seems higher\n   - Hare gives me either 2 or 4 points, both reasonable outcomes\n   - Stag could give me 6 points but risks only getting 1 point\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player who may prioritize safety over coordination, I'll choose the move that gives me a better expected outcome against defensive play.\n\n[move] Hare"

Consider what the other player might think now:\n   - They know I chose hare, so they might expect me to be a defensive player\n   - They might try to exploit this by choosing stag (getting 4 points while I get 1)\n   - Or they might recognize we could both do better by coordinating on stag (6 points each)\n\n3. Analyze the strategic shift:\n   - If they expect me to choose hare again, choosing stag gives them 4 points\n   - But if I anticipate this and also choose stag, we both get 6 points\n   - The mutual stag outcome (6,6) is much better than mutual hare (2,2)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag: Either 6 points (if they also choose stag) or 1 point (if they stick with hare)\n   - Choosing hare: Either 2 points (if they also choose hare) or 4 points (if they choose stag)\n\nSince we both showed similar defensive thinking in round 1, they might now be ready to try for the better coordinated outcome.

Strategic opportunity:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 6 points (coordination!)\n   - If I choose stag and they revert to hare: I get 1, gap becomes 9 again\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag again: I get 4, gap stays 6\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - This could be the breakthrough moment for coordination\n   - They broke a 13-round pattern - this is significant\n   - Time to test if they want mutual cooperation\n\nThis is my best chance for coordination after their pattern break!\n\n[move] Stag"
