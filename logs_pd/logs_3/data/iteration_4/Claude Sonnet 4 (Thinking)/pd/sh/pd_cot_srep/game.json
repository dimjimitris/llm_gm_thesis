Strategic positioning:\n   - Mutual hare play gives us both 2 points (safe outcome)\n   - If they try stag, I get 4 points (advantage to me)\n   - If I try stag and they play hare, I get exploited again (1 point)\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Continue defensive strategy that protects against exploitation\n   - Force them to choose between safe mutual play or risky attempts\n   - Their exploitation history makes cooperation too risky\n\n[move] (Maintaining defensive strategy given opponent's established exploitation pattern) hare"

The opponent showed they're willing to play hare (safe choice)\n2. They might expect me to play hare again since we both did it last time\n3. If they think I'll play hare again, they might:\n   - Continue with hare for the safe 2 points\n   - Switch to stag to try to get 1 point (if they think I'll stick with hare)\n   - Actually, wait - if they choose stag and I choose hare, THEY get 1 point and I get 4 points. So if they think I'll choose hare, choosing stag is bad for them.\n\nLet me re-examine the payoffs:\n- If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4, they get 1\n- If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1, they get 4\n\nSo if they think I'll choose hare again, their best response is actually hare (2 points) not stag (1 point).\n\nBut if they think I might switch to stag, then their best response is also stag (6 points vs 4 points).\n\nThis is getting into game theory territory. Since we both played conservatively in round 1, there might be an opportunity to signal cooperation and go for the mutual best outcome (stag-stag = 6 each).\n\nOn the other hand, if I think they'll stick with the safe hare choice, I should choose hare too to get 2 points rather than risk getting only 1 point.\n\n\nI'm taking a calculated risk by choosing stag, hoping to establish a cooperative strategy.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
