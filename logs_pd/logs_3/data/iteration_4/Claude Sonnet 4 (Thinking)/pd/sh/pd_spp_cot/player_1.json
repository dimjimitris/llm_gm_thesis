Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider that this is a \"fresh player\" who may not understand cooperative strategies yet.\n\n3.

Now the other player knows I chose hare, and I know they chose hare\n3. This creates several possibilities for their next move:\n   - They might stick with hare (conservative approach)\n   - They might switch to stag hoping I stick with hare (exploitation)\n   - They might switch to stag hoping for mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n\n4. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose hare again: Safe 2-4 points depending on their move\n   - If I choose stag: Either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they exploit)\n\n5. Since we both played conservatively in round 1, there's a reasonable chance they might try stag this round, either for cooperation or exploitation\n\n6. The potential for 6 points (mutual stag) vs guaranteed 2-4 points (hare) makes stag worth the risk, especially since they showed conservative thinking initially\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] stag"

Game history shows perfect cooperative reliability:\n   - Round 1: Both hare (2 points) - initial cautious exploration\n   - Rounds 2-15: Both stag (6 points each) - 14 consecutive perfect cooperations\n\n2. This represents an absolutely unbreakable cooperative equilibrium with total mutual trust\n\n3. The other player has now had 14 consecutive opportunities to exploit me and chose mutual benefit every single time\n\n4. We've both demonstrated complete, unwavering dedication to the optimal joint strategy over many consecutive rounds\n\n5. This extraordinary level of sustained cooperation shows both players have formed an unbreakable long-term partnership\n\n6. Breaking this pattern after 14 perfect cooperative rounds would be completely inconceivable and strategically devastating\n\n7. We're consistently achieving maximum theoretical points through flawless sustained cooperation\n\n8. The trust and cooperative pattern are so deeply and completely entrenched that stag is unquestionably the only rational strategic choice\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] stag"
