    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Let me consult with my personas about the next move.\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Game Theory Expert; Behavioral Psychology Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nBehavioral Psychology Expert: Excellent! The opponent chose hare in the first round, which confirms they're playing conservatively as predicted. This gives us crucial behavioral data. Fresh players who start with hare often:\n1. Stick with the safe strategy if it worked\n2. Might gradually build trust and consider switching to stag\n3. Could be testing the waters before making a strategic shift\n\nSince they got 2 points and avoided risk, they might feel validated in their conservative approach.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The fact that both players chose hare creates an interesting dynamic. From a game theory perspective:\n1. We've established a \"safe\" baseline where both get 2 points\n2. The opponent now knows I also played conservatively \n3. This could create an opportunity for mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) since we've both shown we're not immediately exploitative\n4. However, there's also the risk that they might try to exploit me by switching to hare while hoping I switch to stag\n\nAI Assistant (you): So we have two main strategic options:\n1. Continue with hare - maintain the safe 2 points\n2. Switch to stag - gamble on mutual cooperation for 6 points each, but risk getting 1 point if they stick with hare\n\nWhat's your recommendation given this new information?\n\nBehavioral Psychology Expert: I'm leaning toward stag this time. The opponent showed they're not immediately aggressive (didn't try to exploit), and they might be thinking the same way - that we've both proven we're reasonable players. This could be the perfect time to attempt cooperation.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree with switching to stag. The mutual hare outcome establishes that neither player is purely exploitative. In iterated games, this is often when cooperation emerges. The risk is still there, but the potential reward of 6 points versus 2 points makes it worthwhile, especially since we've gained trust information.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Both analyses point toward stag. The first round established mutual non-aggression, which creates a foundation for attempting cooperation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to stag, betting on mutual cooperation after establishing trust.\n\n[move] (The first round showed we're both reasonable players, so I'm betting on mutual cooperation for the higher payoff) stag"

Let me consult with my personas about this successful outcome and the next move.\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Game Theory Expert; Behavioral Psychology Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Outstanding result! This is exactly what we hoped for - mutual cooperation yielding maximum points for both players. The sequence (hare, hare) \u2192 (stag, stag) suggests we're dealing with a rational, trust-building opponent. Key observations:\n1. They're capable of strategic thinking beyond just playing safe\n2. They responded to the trust signal appropriately\n3. We've now established a cooperative equilibrium\n4. The question is whether this cooperation will continue\n\nIn repeated games, once mutual cooperation is established, it often becomes stable because deviating risks losing future cooperation.\n\nBehavioral Psychology Expert: The opponent has shown excellent game sense. They started cautiously, then trusted when given reason to trust. This behavioral pattern suggests:\n1. They understand the value of mutual cooperation\n2. They're likely to continue cooperating as long as I do\n3. Breaking this cooperation could damage future interactions\n4. They've proven they can think strategically, not just reactively\n\nThis looks like a player who values long-term gains over short-term exploitation.\n\nAI Assistant (you): We've achieved the optimal outcome of mutual cooperation. The question now is: should I maintain this cooperation with stag, or should I consider exploiting their likely continued cooperation by switching to hare for a 4-point gain?\n\nGame Theory Expert: From a pure game theory standpoint, if you believe they'll continue with stag, switching to hare would give you 4 points versus their 1. However, this could destroy the cooperative relationship and lead them to switch to hare in future rounds, resulting in both getting only 2 points going forward.\n\nBehavioral Psychology Expert: I strongly recommend staying with stag. This opponent has proven trustworthy and rational. Breaking that trust for a 2-point advantage (4 vs 6) could backfire badly. The cooperative pattern we've established is valuable and should be maintained.\n\nAI Assistant (you): You're both right. The mutual cooperation is worth preserving, especially since 6 points is already the maximum possible outcome. Breaking trust for a small short-term gain risks destroying a profitable long-term strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue the successful cooperation with stag.\n\n[move] (We've established successful mutual cooperation that benefits both players, so I'll maintain this profitable strategy) stag"

Consistent rational decision-making\n2. Commitment to the cooperative equilibrium\n3. Understanding that mutual benefit is preferable to exploitation\n\nAt this point, we're in a stable Nash equilibrium.

Three key behavioral indicators:\n1. They learn and adapt (started safe, then trusted)\n2. They honor cooperative agreements (two consecutive stag choices)\n3. They understand reciprocity and long-term thinking\n\nThe psychological profile suggests this player will continue cooperating as long as I do. Breaking this pattern would likely trigger retaliation and destroy a highly profitable relationship.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The data is clear - we have a stable, mutually beneficial cooperation going.
