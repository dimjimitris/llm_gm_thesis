If I want to have any chance of catching up or winning, I need to either:\n1. Get them to cooperate (stag-stag for 6-6) - but they've shown no interest in this\n2. Exploit them if they ever try to cooperate (hare when they choose stag for 4-1)\n\nBut given their pattern, option 1 seems impossible and option 2 requires them to change first.\n\nActually, let me reconsider.

Evaluate the virtually guaranteed consequences:\n   - If I play stag: 99.999999% chance they play hare \u2192 I get 1 point\n   - This would severely damage my consistent 2.13 average per round\n   - The mutual 6-point scenario is theoretically possible but practically impossible\n\n5. Final strategic assessment:\n   - My opponent has created an absolutely unbreakable pattern of extreme risk aversion\n   - Their behavior is more predictable than natural laws\n   - Any deviation from my proven successful strategy would be completely irrational\n\nThe evidence spans 14 rounds of perfect defensive consistency.\n\n[move] hare"

Identify the Nash equilibria:\n   - (Stag, Stag) is a Nash equilibrium - neither player wants to deviate since 6 > 1\n   - (Hare, Hare) is also a Nash equilibrium - neither player wants to deviate since 2 > 1\n\n2.

Consider the opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might not have experience or established patterns\n   - Fresh players might be either more trusting (choose Stag) or more cautious (choose Hare)\n\n5.
