What are the possible outcomes and their payoffs for me?\n   - If I choose Stag: I get either 6 (if other chooses Stag) or 1 (if other chooses Hare)\n   - If I choose Hare: I get either 4 (if other chooses Stag) or 2 (if other chooses Hare)\n\n2.

What might the other player be thinking?\n   - They're described as a \"fresh player\", meaning they're new\n   - Fresh players might be more cautious or might not understand the optimal strategy yet\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" option (Hare) or might choose randomly\n\n4. What's the Nash equilibrium?\n   - There are two Nash equilibria: (Stag, Stag) and (Hare, Hare)\n   - (Stag, Stag) is better for both players but requires coordination/trust\n   - (Hare, Hare) is safer but yields lower payoffs\n\n5. Strategy consideration:\n   - If I think the other player will choose Stag, I should choose Stag (6 > 4)\n   - If I think the other player will choose Hare, I should choose Hare (2 > 1)\n\nI'm leaning towards a conservative approach. A fresh player is likely to play it safe, choosing Hare to minimize risk. This means I'll probably choose Hare to maximize my guaranteed points, even though it's not the optimal collaborative outcome.\n\nCommunication is impossible, so trust is hard to establish.

We've maintained perfect cooperation for 13 rounds straight\n3. Both players are getting the maximum possible points (6) each round\n4.

My opponent has shown incredible commitment to maintaining this cooperation despite my initial betrayal, and we're both maximizing our outcomes.\n\nThe temptation to defect for a one-time gain of 4 points (vs 6 from cooperation) makes no sense when weighed against the likely permanent loss of future cooperation that would result in only 2 points per round going forward.\n\nI should definitely continue with Stag.",
