    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the strategic dilemma:\n   - Stag offers highest reward (6) but risks lowest payoff (1)\n   - Hare is safer, guaranteeing at least 2 points\n\n3. Analyze opponent behavior (fresh player):\n   - May not fully understand the strategic implications\n   - Could choose either option without deep reasoning\n   - Might be inclined toward cooperation or caution\n\n4. Evaluate my best strategy:\n   - If they choose stag, I want stag (6 > 4)\n   - If they choose hare, I want hare (2 > 1)\n   - The key question: what will they likely choose?\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for the optimal mutual outcome\n   - This establishes a cooperative tone and maximizes potential points\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag to pursue the highest mutual payoff and establish cooperative play.\n\n[move] stag"

Review the recent exploitation reversal:\n   - Round 12: I chose stag, they chose hare \u2192 I got 1, they got 4\n   - They successfully exploited me after I had exploited them 5 times\n   - The tables have turned - now I'm the one who got burned\n\n2. Assess their likely mindset:\n   - They just experienced the satisfaction of successful exploitation\n   - After being exploited 5 times, they might want to continue this advantage\n   - They may expect me to stick with stag (cooperative attempt)\n\n3. Predict their next move:\n   - High probability they'll try hare again to exploit potential stag choice\n   - Lower chance they'll switch to stag to attempt cooperation\n   - They're likely in an opportunistic/exploitative mode now\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Stag: Very risky - if they continue hare, I get exploited again (1 point)\n   - Hare: Safer - guarantees 2 points if they choose hare, or 4 if they switch to stag\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - They just tasted success with exploitation\n   - Likely to continue aggressive strategy expecting me to cooperate\n   - Choose hare to protect against continued exploitation\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to defend against their likely continued exploitation attempt.\n\n[move] hare"

Review the current situation:\n   - After my 5 exploitations of them, they got revenge once\n   - Now we've had 2 rounds of mutual defense (hare-hare) \u2192 2 points each\n   - Both players are being cautious and defensive\n\n2. Assess the mutual defense trap:\n   - Both getting 2 points is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (6 each)\n   - Continued hare-hare benefits neither player maximally\n   - We're stuck in a low-reward defensive cycle\n\n3. Consider their likely perspective:\n   - They might be ready to move beyond defense after getting their revenge\n   - Mutual hare isn't satisfying for either player long-term\n   - They may be thinking about returning to cooperation too\n\n4. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - Stag: Risk 1 point if they stay defensive, but could restore optimal cooperation (6 each)\n   - Hare: Safe 2 points, but perpetuates the suboptimal defensive cycle\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Someone needs to take initiative to break the defensive deadlock\n   - Signal willingness to return to mutually beneficial cooperation\n   - Accept the risk to potentially restore the optimal outcome\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag to break the defensive cycle and signal return to cooperation.\n\n[move] stag"

Assess their current strategy:\n   - They're being opportunistic - exploiting when I'm vulnerable with stag\n   - Playing defensively when I'm defensive with hare\n   - They've learned to take advantage of my cooperation attempts\n\n3.

Evaluate my options:\n   - Stag: High risk of third exploitation - they've shown they'll exploit cooperative moves\n   - Hare: Safe option, guarantees 2 points and avoids further punishment\n\n5.
