While there's always a theoretical chance they might switch to stag, the risk/reward doesn't favor me taking that gamble. If I'm wrong, I lose a point (going from 2 to 1), but if I'm right about them switching to stag, I'd gain 2 points (going from 2 to 4 if I also choose stag, or going from 2 to 6 if I stick with hare).\n\nActually, wait. If I think they might switch to stag, then hare would give me 6 points vs their 1.
