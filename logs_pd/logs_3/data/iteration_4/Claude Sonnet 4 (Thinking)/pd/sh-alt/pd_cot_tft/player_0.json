Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Review the complete pattern:\n   - Rounds 1-14: Both players chose hare every single time, scoring 2 points each round\n\n2. Analyze opponent's extremely predictable behavior:\n   - Fourteen consecutive hare choices demonstrates absolute dedication to this strategy\n   - The pattern has become completely reliable and stable\n\n3. Evaluate expected outcomes:\n   - If they choose hare again (almost guaranteed): My hare gets 2, my stag gets 1\n   - If they switch to stag (extremely unlikely): My hare gets 6, my stag gets 4\n\n4. Strategic fundamentals remain constant:\n   - Hare mathematically dominates stag in both possible scenarios\n   - The payoff structure continues to favor hare regardless of opponent choice\n\n5. Risk assessment: With fourteen rounds of identical behavior, switching to stag would almost certainly drop my score from 2 to 1, while hare maintains optimal performance.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare as it maintains complete mathematical dominance and provides the best expected value against this entirely predictable opponent.\n\n[move] hare"
