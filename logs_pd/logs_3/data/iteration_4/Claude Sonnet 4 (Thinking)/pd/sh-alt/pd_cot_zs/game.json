Consider what a fresh player might do:\n   - They might choose hare for safety (guaranteed at least 2 points)\n   - They might choose hare hoping to get 6 points if I choose stag\n   - Fresh players often avoid the riskier cooperative option\n\n3. Evaluate my best response:\n   - If I expect them to choose hare, then I should choose hare (getting 2 vs 1)\n   - If I expect them to choose stag, then I should choose hare (getting 6 vs 4)\n   - Hare dominates stag in terms of expected value against an unpredictable opponent\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag is high-risk, high-cooperation but vulnerable to exploitation\n   - Choosing hare is safer and gives me the best outcome regardless of their choice\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player who likely doesn't have an established strategy, hare is the rational choice that maximizes my expected points while minimizing risk.\n\n[move] hare"

Consider Nash equilibria:\n   - (Stag, Stag) is a Nash equilibrium with payoff (4,4)\n   - (Hare, Hare) is also a Nash equilibrium with payoff (2,2)\n   - The mixed strategy equilibria exist too\n\n5.

      "reasoning_text": "The other player has chosen hare 15 times in a row now. This is an extremely consistent pattern. I've been choosing hare every time too, which gives me 2 points each round. \n\nLet me think strategically about this:\n\n1. If they continue with hare (which seems very likely given 15 consecutive choices), and I choose hare, I get 2 points.\n2. If they continue with hare and I choose stag, I get 1 point.\n3. If they switch to stag (unlikely but possible) and I choose hare, I get 6 points.\n4. If they switch to stag and I choose stag, I get 4 points.\n\nGiven their extremely consistent pattern of choosing hare, the probability they'll choose hare again is very high. So:\n- Hare vs Hare = 2 points (most likely outcome)\n- Stag vs Hare = 1 point (if I deviate but they don't)\n\nThe only way I could get more than 2 points is if they switch to stag while I stay with hare (6 points) or if we both switch to stag (4 points). But given their pattern, switching to stag myself would likely just reduce my points from 2 to 1.\n\nHare remains the optimal choice.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
