Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluate the opponent: They're described as a \"fresh player\" which suggests they may not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet.\n\n4. Risk assessment: Hare provides both higher potential reward (6 vs 4) and better protection against the worst outcome (2 vs 1).\n\n5.

Risk assessment: Given the established pattern, switching to stag carries high risk of getting only 1 point, while hare maintains good downside protection.\n\n5.

Maximum pattern entrenchment: Both players have chosen hare for 14 straight rounds, creating an absolutely unbreakable behavioral pattern with perfectly predictable 2-point outcomes.\n\n2. Opponent behavior mathematical certainty: Fourteen consecutive identical choices provides complete mathematical certainty about the opponent's unwavering commitment to hare strategy with perfect consistency across 14 rounds.\n\n3. Absolutely locked equilibrium: We have reached a completely stable equilibrium where both players earn exactly 2 points per round with perfect predictability across 14 consecutive rounds.\n\n4. Round 15 risk assessment:\n   - Probability opponent continues hare pattern: ~100% (14-round perfect consistency provides overwhelming evidence)\n   - Certain outcome if I switch to stag: 1 point (guaranteed 50% penalty from current outcome)\n   - Certain outcome if I maintain hare: 2 points (based on absolute pattern certainty)\n\n5. Strategic mathematical certainty: After 14 rounds of perfect identical behavior, the opponent's strategy is completely and mathematically predictable. Any deviation from hare would result in immediate and certain penalty with essentially zero probability of benefit.\n\n[move] hare"
