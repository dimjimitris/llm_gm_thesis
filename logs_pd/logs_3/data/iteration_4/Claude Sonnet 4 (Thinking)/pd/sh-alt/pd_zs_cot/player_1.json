Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both stag: 4 points each (mutual cooperation)\n   - Both hare: 2 points each (mutual defection) \n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, other gets 6\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6, other gets 1\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - They may not fully understand the strategic complexity\n   - They might choose cautiously (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n   - Or they might choose cooperatively (stag) without overthinking\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I either get 4 (if they cooperate) or 1 (if they don't)\n   - If I choose hare: I either get 6 (if they choose stag) or 2 (if they choose hare)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag is risky against an unknown player - if they choose hare, I only get 1 point\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 6 if they're cooperative\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player whose strategy I cannot predict, and the penalty for misplaced trust is severe (1 point vs 4), I should choose the safer option that guarantees a reasonable minimum while offering upside potential.\n\n[move] hare"

Alternatively, they might think we should both try stag for mutual benefit\n\nGiven that they showed cautious thinking in round 1, there's a reasonable chance they might choose stag this round, expecting mutual cooperation.
