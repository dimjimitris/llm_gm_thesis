Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the dominant strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses stag: Hare gives me 6 points vs Stag gives me 4 points\n   - If opponent chooses hare: Hare gives me 2 points vs Stag gives me 1 point\n   - Hare is better regardless of opponent's choice\n\n3. Consider the risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag risks getting only 1 point if opponent chooses hare\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 6 points\n\n4. Factor in that opponent is a \"fresh player\":\n   - They may not have developed cooperative strategies yet\n   - They might choose the safer, dominant strategy (hare)\n   - Playing hare protects me from exploitation\n\nSince hare dominates stag in all scenarios and provides better protection against an unpredictable fresh player, my optimal strategy is clear.\n\n[move] hare"

Consider the opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They chose the dominant strategy (hare) in round 1\n   - They may stick with the safe choice again\n   - Or they might consider switching to stag for better mutual payoff\n\n3. Evaluate the risk-reward for this round:\n   - If I switch to stag and opponent stays with hare: I get 1, they get 6 (bad for me)\n   - If I switch to stag and opponent also switches: We both get 4 (good outcome)\n   - If I stick with hare: I get either 2 or 6 points depending on their choice\n\n4. Consider the early stage of the game:\n   - Only second round, no trust established yet\n   - No communication to coordinate cooperation\n   - The punishment for being exploited is severe (1 point vs their 6)\n\n5.

Consider pattern implications:\n   - Both players clearly recognize we're trapped in (2,2) vs optimal (4,4)\n   - Twelve rounds of identical outcomes might intensify mutual awareness of missed opportunities\n   - Extended consistency could theoretically create conditions for coordinated change\n\n3. Evaluate behavioral prediction strength:\n   - Twelve rounds represents exceptional statistical evidence\n   - Opponent has shown absolute zero willingness to experiment across any round\n   - Perfect track record indicates unwavering commitment to risk-averse strategy\n   - No cooperation signals or experimental behavior throughout extended play\n\n4. Calculate strategic risk assessment:\n   - Mutual stag would double our earnings (4 points each vs current 2)\n   - Unilateral stag risks severe penalty (1 point vs opponent's 6)\n   - Twelve rounds of perfect consistency predicts near-certainty of continued hare selection\n\n5. Apply rational decision framework:\n   - Opponent's flawless twelve-round record provides strongest possible behavioral predictor\n   - Mathematical expectation continues to favor guaranteed 2 points over risky cooperation attempt\n   - No communication channel exists to coordinate simultaneous strategy shift\n\n[move] hare"
