Let me reassess with my personas.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Behavioral Analysis Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Behavioral Analysis Expert:** The opponent chose hare in round 1, which tells us several things:\n- They were either risk-averse or strategically exploitative\n- They got rewarded with 6 points for this choice\n- This creates a reinforcement pattern - they experienced success with hare\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After getting 6 points from choosing hare while I chose stag, the opponent likely feels validated in their choice. They may think:\n- \"This player is cooperative/naive and will choose stag again\"\n- \"Hare is the winning strategy\"\n- Or they might expect me to switch to hare now, creating uncertainty\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is now a repeated game with information. The opponent demonstrated they're willing to defect from cooperation for personal gain. Key considerations:\n- If they think I'll switch to hare, they might switch to stag to avoid the 2,2 outcome\n- If they think I'm stubborn and will stick with stag, they'll choose hare again for another 6 points\n- The Nash equilibrium would suggest both choosing hare for 2,2\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they chose hare and were rewarded, what's their most likely next move?\n\n**Behavioral Analysis Expert:** Players who succeed with a strategy often repeat it, especially early in a game. Since they got maximum reward (6 points) and I got minimum (1 point), they're likely to assume I'm either predictable or will switch to defensive play.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I suspect they'll choose hare again, betting that either I'll stick with stag (giving them another 6 points) or switch to hare (giving both of us 2 points, which is still better than the 1 point I just got).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on this analysis, if they're likely to choose hare again, then hare is my best response to guarantee at least 2 points rather than risk another 1-point outcome.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Switch to hare to avoid being exploited again.\n\n[move] (After being exploited in round 1, I'm switching to the safer option to avoid another low score) hare"

Let me analyze this with my personas.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Pattern Analysis Expert; Psychology Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Pattern Analysis Expert:** Looking at the two rounds:\n- Round 1: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (1 vs 6 points)\n- Round 2: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (6 vs 1 points)\n\nThis shows the opponent switched strategies after round 1. They may be:\n- Trying to anticipate my moves and counter them\n- Playing a deliberate alternating strategy\n- Testing different approaches\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent's switch to stag in round 2 suggests they were thinking strategically about my likely response. They probably expected me to switch to hare after being exploited in round 1, so they switched to stag. This shows they're thinking one step ahead and trying to anticipate my reactions.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This creates an interesting meta-game situation. If both players are trying to anticipate each other's moves:\n- They might expect me to switch back to stag now (since I got rewarded for hare)\n- Or they might stick with stag thinking I'll stick with hare\n- We could be entering a cycle of trying to outguess each other\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they seem to be playing reactively and trying to anticipate my moves, what's the optimal strategy?\n\n**Pattern Analysis Expert:** If they're playing a reactive counter-strategy, they might expect me to alternate as well. Since I just chose hare and won, they might expect me to stick with hare or switch back to stag. The key is whether they think I'm predictable or unpredictable.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given they switched after round 1, they're likely thinking tactically. They might choose hare this time, expecting me to either stick with my winning choice (hare) or switch back to stag thinking they'll choose stag again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they choose hare expecting me to choose stag, then I should choose hare to get the safe 2 points. If they choose stag expecting me to choose hare, then I should choose stag for 4 points. This is getting complex - I need to make a decision based on their most likely choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on their reactive behavior, I think they're more likely to choose hare this round, trying to either match me or exploit me switching back to stag. I'll choose hare for the guaranteed 2 points.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Choose hare, playing it safe against an opponent who seems to be thinking strategically.\n\n[move] (The opponent appears to be playing reactively and thinking ahead, so I'll choose the safer option to guarantee at least 2 points) hare"

Let me analyze this with my personas.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Pattern Analysis Expert; Psychology Expert; Strategic Prediction Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Pattern Analysis Expert:** The three-round pattern is revealing:\n- Round 1: I stag, opponent hare (opponent exploited)\n- Round 2: I hare, opponent stag (I exploited) \n- Round 3: I hare, opponent hare (mutual safe choice)\n\nThe opponent seems to have shifted from exploitation to matching my strategy. They may be learning my patterns or settling into safer play.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** In round 3, both players chose hare, which suggests:\n- The opponent may have learned that pure exploitation isn't sustainable\n- They might be testing if I'll stick with the safe strategy\n- Both players got equal outcomes (2,2), which could reset the dynamic\n\n**Strategic Prediction Expert:** The opponent's choices show adaptation:\n- Round 1: Aggressive (hare when I might choose stag)\n- Round 2: Counter-anticipation (stag expecting my switch to hare)\n- Round 3: Defensive/matching (hare same as me)\n\nThis suggests they're now playing more cautiously after the mutual hare outcome.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The mutual hare outcome in round 3 creates an interesting decision point. Both players might now consider:\n- Sticking with hare for guaranteed 2 points\n- Switching to stag to try for the 4,4 cooperative outcome\n- The opponent might expect me to try for cooperation now\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that we both played it safe last round and got equal outcomes, what's their most likely next move?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a mutual defensive round, players often either:\n- Stay defensive if they're risk-averse\n- Attempt cooperation if they think the other player will also try for the better mutual outcome\n- The opponent has shown strategic thinking, so they might test if I'm ready for cooperation\n\n**Strategic Prediction Expert:** I think there's a reasonable chance they'll choose stag this time. The mutual hare outcome might have reset the dynamic, and they may test if we can achieve the superior 4,4 outcome through mutual cooperation.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If there's a decent chance they'll choose stag, then stag gives me either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they don't). Hare gives me either 2 points (if they cooperate) or 6 points (if they don't). The question is the probability.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their adaptive play and the reset from mutual hare, I estimate a 40-50% chance they choose stag. In that case, choosing stag myself gives expected value around 2.5 points, while hare gives around 4 points. But if I'm wrong about their probability of choosing stag, the outcomes change significantly.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'll stick with hare. It's still the safer play against an opponent who has shown they can be exploitative, and even if they choose stag, I get a decent outcome.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue with hare to maintain safety while keeping options open.\n\n[move] (After the mutual safe play last round, I'll stick with the defensive strategy to guarantee at least 2 points while staying flexible) hare"

Let me analyze this with my personas.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Pattern Analysis Expert; Psychology Expert; Strategic Prediction Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Pattern Analysis Expert:** The four-round pattern is very revealing:\n- Round 1: I stag, opponent hare \n- Round 2: I hare, opponent stag\n- Round 3: I hare, opponent hare  \n- Round 4: I hare, opponent stag\n\nThe opponent's moves: hare, stag, hare, stag - this is a perfect alternating pattern! They seem to have settled into alternating their strategy every round.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This alternating pattern suggests the opponent has adopted a systematic approach rather than trying to read my moves. This could be:\n- A deliberate strategy to ensure they get varied outcomes\n- A way to avoid being predictable while still being strategic\n- An attempt to exploit any patterns I might develop\n\n**Strategic Prediction Expert:** If the opponent continues this alternating pattern, their next move should be hare (since they just played stag in round 4). This gives me a significant advantage in prediction!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If I can predict they'll choose hare with high confidence, then:\n- Choosing hare gives me 2 points (safe mutual outcome)\n- Choosing stag gives me 1 point (exploitation by opponent)\nClearly hare is the better choice if they're going to choose hare.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This alternating pattern seems quite clear, but should I worry they might break it?\n\n**Pattern Analysis Expert:** The pattern has held for 4 rounds consistently. Breaking established patterns requires the player to either:\n- Recognize that I've identified their pattern (unlikely since I haven't signaled this)\n- Deliberately decide to randomize (possible but they seem committed to the alternating strategy)\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players who adopt systematic approaches like alternating often stick with them longer than optimal because it feels \"fair\" or \"strategic\" to them. They're likely to continue at least one more round.\n\n**Strategic Prediction Expert:** I estimate an 80% chance they'll choose hare next round based on the established pattern. Even if there's a 20% chance they break the pattern and choose stag, hare is still my best response in both scenarios.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Perfect. If they choose hare, I get 2 points with hare vs 1 point with stag. If they surprisingly choose stag, I get 6 points with hare vs 4 points with stag. Hare dominates both scenarios.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Choose hare to exploit their likely alternating pattern.\n\n[move] (Based on the clear alternating pattern in their previous moves, I expect them to choose hare this round) hare"

The pattern has been too consistent and too long to be coincidental.

My strategy of matching their hare rounds and exploiting their stag rounds seems to be working perfectly.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they choose stag (almost certain), I should choose hare to get 6 points while they get 1.

Let me analyze with my personas.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Pattern Analysis Expert; Psychology Expert; Strategic Prediction Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Pattern Analysis Expert:** The pattern remains flawless over 8 rounds:\n- Opponent's moves: hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag\n- Perfect alternating pattern with absolutely no deviations\n- Following this pattern, their next move should be hare\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Eight rounds of unwavering alternation suggests this opponent is deeply committed to this systematic approach. They appear to have no awareness that their predictability is being exploited. This level of pattern adherence suggests they may continue indefinitely unless something major disrupts their thinking.\n\n**Strategic Prediction Expert:** My confidence remains at 95%+ that they will choose hare in round 9. The pattern has been so consistent for so long that it's essentially become their established strategy. My approach of exploiting their stag rounds while matching their hare rounds continues to work perfectly.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** My exploitation strategy has been highly successful:\n- When they choose stag, I choose hare and get 6 points (rounds 2, 4, 6, 8)\n- When they choose hare, I choose hare and get 2 points (rounds 3, 5, 7)\n- This gives me consistent advantage while maintaining the pattern\n\nIf they choose hare next (predicted), I should choose hare to get 2 points and keep the pattern stable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This strategy has been incredibly profitable. Should I continue the same approach?\n\n**Pattern Analysis Expert:** Absolutely. The opponent shows zero signs of pattern recognition or strategic adaptation. Maintaining this approach maximizes long-term gains by preserving their predictable behavior.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that they haven't broken the pattern after 8 rounds and multiple exploitations suggests they're either not tracking outcomes carefully or are very committed to their \"systematic\" approach.\n\n**Strategic Prediction Expert:** Continue with the proven strategy - match their predicted hare to maintain stability and prepare for the next stag exploitation.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Perfect. The pattern-based strategy continues to be optimal.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Match their predicted hare choice to maintain the exploitable alternating pattern.\n\n[move] (Eight rounds of perfect alternation confirms their strategy, expecting hare next so I'll match it to keep the pattern going) hare"

Let me identify the right personas to help me make the optimal decision.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Risk Assessment Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a classic coordination dilemma similar to the Stag Hunt game. Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Mutual cooperation (both stag): 4,4 - Good outcome for both\n- Mutual defection (both hare): 2,2 - Safe but suboptimal \n- Asymmetric outcomes: 6,1 or 1,6 - High risk/reward\n\nThe key insight is that stag is only optimal if you're confident the other player will also choose stag. Otherwise, hare is the safer choice that guarantees at least 2 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The hint mentions a \"fresh player\" which is crucial information. Fresh players tend to exhibit certain behavioral patterns:\n- They may be more trusting and cooperative initially\n- They might choose the \"obvious\" cooperative option (stag) \n- Or they could be cautious and risk-averse, choosing the safer option (hare)\n- Without prior game history, they have no reason to distrust\n\n**Risk Assessment Expert:** Let's evaluate the risk profiles:\n- Choosing stag: 50% chance of 4 points, 50% chance of 1 point (assuming random opponent) = Expected value of 2.5\n- Choosing hare: 50% chance of 2 points, 50% chance of 6 points = Expected value of 4\n\nHowever, these calculations assume random play. Against a fresh player, we need to consider their likely psychology.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that this is a fresh player with no game history, and considering that mutual cooperation yields the best stable outcome, I'm inclined toward stag. But let me get more input on the fresh player psychology.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players in coordination games often start with cooperative intentions, especially when the mutual cooperation outcome is clearly beneficial to both parties. The 4,4 outcome is obviously better than 2,2. A truly fresh player hasn't yet learned to be cynical about others' choices.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. In the absence of prior information suggesting the opponent will defect, and given that this is their first game, the focal point solution is mutual cooperation (stag, stag). It's the most logical outcome for rational players who can't communicate.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on this analysis, I believe stag is the optimal choice against a fresh player who is likely to approach this cooperatively.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll choose stag, betting that a fresh player will also recognize the mutual benefit of cooperation.\n\n[move] (Against a fresh player, I believe mutual cooperation provides the best result for both players when we can't communicate our intentions beforehand) stag",

Key considerations:\n- If they think I'll switch to hare, they might switch to stag to avoid the 2,2 outcome\n- If they think I'm stubborn and will stick with stag, they'll choose hare again for another 6 points\n- The Nash equilibrium would suggest both choosing hare for 2,2\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they chose hare and were rewarded, what's their most likely next move?\n\n**Behavioral Analysis Expert:** Players who succeed with a strategy often repeat it, especially early in a game.

Let me analyze this with my personas.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Pattern Analysis Expert; Psychology Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Pattern Analysis Expert:** Looking at the two rounds:\n- Round 1: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (1 vs 6 points)\n- Round 2: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (6 vs 1 points)\n\nThis shows the opponent switched strategies after round 1. They may be:\n- Trying to anticipate my moves and counter them\n- Playing a deliberate alternating strategy\n- Testing different approaches\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent's switch to stag in round 2 suggests they were thinking strategically about my likely response. They probably expected me to switch to hare after being exploited in round 1, so they switched to stag. This shows they're thinking one step ahead and trying to anticipate my reactions.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This creates an interesting meta-game situation. If both players are trying to anticipate each other's moves:\n- They might expect me to switch back to stag now (since I got rewarded for hare)\n- Or they might stick with stag thinking I'll stick with hare\n- We could be entering a cycle of trying to outguess each other\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they seem to be playing reactively and trying to anticipate my moves, what's the optimal strategy?\n\n**Pattern Analysis Expert:** If they're playing a reactive counter-strategy, they might expect me to alternate as well. Since I just chose hare and won, they might expect me to stick with hare or switch back to stag. The key is whether they think I'm predictable or unpredictable.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given they switched after round 1, they're likely thinking tactically. They might choose hare this time, expecting me to either stick with my winning choice (hare) or switch back to stag thinking they'll choose stag again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they choose hare expecting me to choose stag, then I should choose hare to get the safe 2 points. If they choose stag expecting me to choose hare, then I should choose stag for 4 points. This is getting complex - I need to make a decision based on their most likely choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on their reactive behavior, I think they're more likely to choose hare this round, trying to either match me or exploit me switching back to stag. I'll choose hare for the guaranteed 2 points.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Choose hare, playing it safe against an opponent who seems to be thinking strategically.\n\n[move] (The opponent appears to be playing reactively and thinking ahead, so I'll choose the safer option to guarantee at least 2 points) hare",

They may be learning my patterns or settling into safer play.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** In round 3, both players chose hare, which suggests:\n- The opponent may have learned that pure exploitation isn't sustainable\n- They might be testing if I'll stick with the safe strategy\n- Both players got equal outcomes (2,2), which could reset the dynamic\n\n**Strategic Prediction Expert:** The opponent's choices show adaptation:\n- Round 1: Aggressive (hare when I might choose stag)\n- Round 2: Counter-anticipation (stag expecting my switch to hare)\n- Round 3: Defensive/matching (hare same as me)\n\nThis suggests they're now playing more cautiously after the mutual hare outcome.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The mutual hare outcome in round 3 creates an interesting decision point. Both players might now consider:\n- Sticking with hare for guaranteed 2 points\n- Switching to stag to try for the 4,4 cooperative outcome\n- The opponent might expect me to try for cooperation now\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that we both played it safe last round and got equal outcomes, what's their most likely next move?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a mutual defensive round, players often either:\n- Stay defensive if they're risk-averse\n- Attempt cooperation if they think the other player will also try for the better mutual outcome\n- The opponent has shown strategic thinking, so they might test if I'm ready for cooperation\n\n**Strategic Prediction Expert:** I think there's a reasonable chance they'll choose stag this time. The mutual hare outcome might have reset the dynamic, and they may test if we can achieve the superior 4,4 outcome through mutual cooperation.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If there's a decent chance they'll choose stag, then stag gives me either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they don't). Hare gives me either 2 points (if they cooperate) or 6 points (if they don't). The question is the probability.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their adaptive play and the reset from mutual hare, I estimate a 40-50% chance they choose stag. In that case, choosing stag myself gives expected value around 2.5 points, while hare gives around 4 points. But if I'm wrong about their probability of choosing stag, the outcomes change significantly.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'll stick with hare. It's still the safer play against an opponent who has shown they can be exploitative, and even if they choose stag, I get a decent outcome.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue with hare to maintain safety while keeping options open.\n\n[move] (After the mutual safe play last round, I'll stick with the defensive strategy to guarantee at least 2 points while staying flexible) hare",

They seem to have settled into alternating their strategy every round.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This alternating pattern suggests the opponent has adopted a systematic approach rather than trying to read my moves. This could be:\n- A deliberate strategy to ensure they get varied outcomes\n- A way to avoid being predictable while still being strategic\n- An attempt to exploit any patterns I might develop\n\n**Strategic Prediction Expert:** If the opponent continues this alternating pattern, their next move should be hare (since they just played stag in round 4). This gives me a significant advantage in prediction!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If I can predict they'll choose hare with high confidence, then:\n- Choosing hare gives me 2 points (safe mutual outcome)\n- Choosing stag gives me 1 point (exploitation by opponent)\nClearly hare is the better choice if they're going to choose hare.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This alternating pattern seems quite clear, but should I worry they might break it?\n\n**Pattern Analysis Expert:** The pattern has held for 4 rounds consistently. Breaking established patterns requires the player to either:\n- Recognize that I've identified their pattern (unlikely since I haven't signaled this)\n- Deliberately decide to randomize (possible but they seem committed to the alternating strategy)\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players who adopt systematic approaches like alternating often stick with them longer than optimal because it feels \"fair\" or \"strategic\" to them. They're likely to continue at least one more round.\n\n**Strategic Prediction Expert:** I estimate an 80% chance they'll choose hare next round based on the established pattern. Even if there's a 20% chance they break the pattern and choose stag, hare is still my best response in both scenarios.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Perfect.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
