The game structure is essentially a stag hunt game, which is similar to a coordination game but with different incentives than a pure prisoner's dilemma.\n\nLet me think about this again:\n- Both choose stag: 4, 4 (mutual cooperation, high payoff)\n- Both choose hare: 2, 2 (mutual defection, low but safe payoff)\n- I choose stag, other chooses hare: 1, 6 (I get exploited)\n- I choose hare, other chooses stag: 6, 1 (I exploit them)\n\nIn a stag hunt, there are actually two Nash equilibria:\n1. Both choose stag (4,4) - the payoff-dominant equilibrium\n2. Both choose hare (2,2) - the risk-dominant equilibrium\n\nThe issue is that while (stag, stag) gives better payoffs, it requires coordination and trust. Without that, players tend toward the safer hare choice.\n\nHowever, given that we've now seen 6 rounds where EVERY player has chosen hare, it might be worth considering whether there's an opportunity here. If I could somehow signal or if there's a chance the next player might try stag, there could be value in switching.\n\nBut the key insight is that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" each time - so there's no reputation building or learning from previous interactions. Each player is making their decision independently without knowing the history.\n\nGiven that hare is still the dominant strategy (it gives me the best outcome regardless of what the opponent does), I should stick with it.",
