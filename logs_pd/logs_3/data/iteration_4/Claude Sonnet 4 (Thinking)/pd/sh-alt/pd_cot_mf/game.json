Consider what a fresh player might do:\n   - A new player might choose the \"safer\" option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n   - Alternatively, they might try to cooperate initially and choose stag\n   - Without prior information, I should assume they're unpredictable\n\n3. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Choosing stag is high-risk, high-reward: great if they cooperate (4 points), terrible if they don't (1 point)\n   - Choosing hare is safer: decent outcome regardless (6 points if they cooperate, 2 points if they don't)\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - Against an unknown fresh player, the safer strategy is hare\n   - This guarantees at least 2 points and gives me a chance at the maximum 6 points\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since this is against a fresh player with unknown tendencies, I'll choose the safer option that protects against the worst outcome while still allowing for a high payoff.\n\n[move] hare"

What are the possible outcomes and their payoffs for me?\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 4 (if other chooses stag) or 1 (if other chooses hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 6 (if other chooses stag) or 2 (if other chooses hare)\n\n2. What's the risk-reward analysis?\n   - Stag is the \"cooperative\" choice - high reward if both cooperate (4 points), but low reward if the other defects (1 point)\n   - Hare is the \"safe\" choice - guaranteed at least 2 points, with potential for 6 if the other tries to cooperate\n\n3. What should I consider about the other player?\n   - The hint says this is a \"fresh player\" - this could mean they're new and might not understand the optimal strategy\n   - A fresh player might be more likely to choose the seemingly \"safe\" option (hare) or might choose randomly\n   - Alternatively, a fresh player might try to cooperate initially\n\n4. Game theory considerations:\n   - The Nash equilibrium in this game is actually both choosing stag (4,4) since it's Pareto optimal\n   - But there's also a Nash equilibrium at both choosing hare (2,2)\n   - The dilemma is that hare dominates stag from a safety perspective\n\n5.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
