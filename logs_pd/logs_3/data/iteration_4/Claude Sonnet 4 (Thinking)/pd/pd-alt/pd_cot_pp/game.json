Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - They likely haven't developed a complex strategy yet\n   - They might be more inclined toward cooperation initially\n   - No history between us to base predictions on\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they cooperate and I cooperate: 6 points (good)\n   - If they cooperate and I defect: 4 points (tempting but breaks trust)\n   - If they defect and I cooperate: 1 point (bad for me)\n   - If they defect and I defect: 2 points (defensive)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Cooperation offers the highest mutual benefit (6,6)\n   - Starting with cooperation signals good faith\n   - Against a fresh player, cooperation might encourage future cooperation if we play multiple rounds\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Start with cooperation to maximize mutual benefit and signal trustworthiness.\n\n[move] Cooperation"

If I assume the other player will cooperate, then:\n   - If I cooperate: I get 6 points\n   - If I defect: I get 4 points\n   So cooperation is better if they cooperate.\n\n2. If I assume the other player will defect, then:\n   - If I cooperate: I get 1 point\n   - If I defect: I get 2 points\n   So defection is better if they defect.\n\n3. From a pure game theory perspective, defection is the \"dominant strategy\" because:\n   - If they cooperate, I'm better off defecting (4 > 6 is wrong... wait let me recheck)\n   \nLet me reread the payoffs:\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nSo:\n- If they cooperate and I cooperate: I get 6\n\n\n- If they cooperate and I defect: I get 4\n- If they defect and I cooperate: I get 1  \n- If they defect and I defect: I get 2\n\nThe game reveals a complex strategic landscape. Each choice yields different outcomes depending on the other player's move. There's no clear-cut winning strategy, as the optimal decision shifts based on anticipated opponent behavior.\n\nIn a one-shot scenario with an unknown player, I'm leaning towards cooperation. The mutual cooperation outcome offers the best collective result, and it signals my willingness to work together. While the temptation to defect exists, I believe starting with good faith might encourage reciprocal behavior.\n\nThe fresh player context suggests potential openness to collaboration. By choosing cooperation, I maximize our joint benefit and demonstrate a constructive approach to the game's strategic challenge.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
