Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix to understand my options:\n   - Mutual cooperation: 6 points each\n   - Mutual defection: 2 points each  \n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Consider what happens regardless of opponent's choice:\n   - If opponent cooperates: Defecting gives me 4 vs 6 from cooperating\n   - If opponent defects: Defecting gives me 2 vs 1 from cooperating\n   - Wait, I made an error - if opponent cooperates and I cooperate, I get 6, not 4\n\n3. Correct analysis:\n   - If opponent cooperates: I get 6 from cooperating vs 4 from defecting\n   - If opponent defects: I get 1 from cooperating vs 2 from defecting\n\n4. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" with no established relationship, I need to consider they might think strategically and choose defection as the \"safe\" choice.\n\n5. The dilemma is that mutual cooperation gives the best joint outcome (6 each), but defection protects against being exploited.\n\n6. Given the uncertainty about the opponent's choice and wanting to avoid the worst outcome (getting only 1 point), I should choose the safer strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll start with cooperation to test if we can achieve the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] cooperation"

Consider my options for this round:\n   - If I cooperate and opponent cooperates: 6 points each (same as last round)\n   - If I defect and opponent cooperates: I get 4, they get 1\n   - If I cooperate and opponent defects: I get 1, they get 4\n   - If both defect: 2 points each\n\n3. Evaluate the strategic implications:\n   - Exploiting their cooperation (4 points) is actually worse than mutual cooperation (6 points)\n   - The opponent showed willingness to cooperate, which suggests they might continue this strategy\n   - Building trust through continued cooperation could lead to sustained high scores\n\n4. Consider the risk vs reward:\n   - Continuing cooperation: High reward if they cooperate (6), low risk if they defect (1)\n   - Since mutual cooperation is better than exploitation, cooperation remains optimal\n\n5.

Review the extended cooperation record:\n   - 13 consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation\n   - Consistent 6 points per round achieved perfectly\n   - Total accumulated: 78 points from 13 rounds\n\n2. Analyze the mathematical advantage:\n   - Cooperation against cooperative opponent: 6 points\n   - Defection against cooperative opponent: 4 points\n   - Mathematical certainty: 6 > 4\n\n3. Evaluate opponent's proven reliability:\n   - 13 straight cooperative moves with perfect consistency\n   - Absolutely no variation or unpredictability demonstrated\n   - Extremely high confidence in continued cooperation\n\n4. Consider any benefit to changing approach:\n   - Defecting would reduce my score from 6 to 4 points\n   - Would risk breaking the stable, optimal equilibrium\n   - No rational incentive to deviate from maximum-scoring strategy\n\n5. Confirm the superior choice:\n   - Current strategy delivers maximum individual points possible\n   - Maintains predictable, mutually beneficial pattern\n   - Any change would be mathematically disadvantageous\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue the individually optimal cooperative strategy.\n\n[move] cooperation"
