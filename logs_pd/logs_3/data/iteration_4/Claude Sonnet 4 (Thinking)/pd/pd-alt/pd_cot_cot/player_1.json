    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Both defect: 2 points each \n   - I cooperate, they defect: I get 1, they get 4\n   - I defect, they cooperate: I get 4, they get 1\n\n2. Consider that this is a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players may be more inclined to cooperate initially\n   - They might not immediately jump to the purely self-interested defection strategy\n   - They may want to establish a collaborative tone\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 6 points (excellent outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point (poor outcome)\n   - If I defect: guaranteed at least 2 points, potentially 4\n\n4. Strategic consideration:\n   - Mutual cooperation (6,6) is better than mutual defection (2,2)\n   - Since they're fresh, there's a reasonable chance they'll try cooperation first\n   - I can establish a positive precedent\n\nFinal decision: I'll take the calculated risk and cooperate, betting that a fresh player will also choose cooperation for the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] Cooperation"

Analyze what happened in the previous round:\n   - I cooperated, they defected\n   - I got 1 point, they got 4 points\n   - This shows they're willing to exploit cooperative behavior\n\n2. Consider their likely strategy:\n   - They demonstrated a willingness to defect when I cooperated\n   - They may continue this pattern, expecting me to cooperate again\n   - Or they might switch to cooperation if they think I'll retaliate with defection\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate again and they defect again: I get 1 point (bad)\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: We both get 6 points (good)\n   - If I defect and they defect: We both get 2 points (neutral)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points (good for me)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Cooperating again carries high risk of being exploited again\n   - Defecting guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4\n   - Since they already showed they'll take advantage of cooperation, the risk is too high\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - I need to protect myself from further exploitation\n   - Defecting sends a signal that I won't be taken advantage of repeatedly\n\nFinal decision: I'll defect to avoid being exploited again and secure at least 2 points.\n\n[move] Defection"

Consider their likely strategy:\n   - They've consistently chosen defection regardless of my move\n   - This suggests they may be playing a pure defection strategy\n   - Or they're being very cautious and defensive\n\n3.

Assess probability:\n   - Two consecutive defections suggest they're committed to this strategy\n   - The risk of cooperating and getting only 1 point again is high\n   - Defecting guarantees at least 2 points\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Given their consistent defection pattern, the safer choice is to defect\n   - This protects me from exploitation while maintaining steady points\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with defection to secure 2 points and avoid the risk of being exploited again.\n\n[move] Defection"

Assess their strategy:\n   - Three consecutive defections strongly indicates a consistent defection strategy\n   - They haven't shown any willingness to cooperate even when I switched to defection\n   - This suggests they're either playing pure defection or being extremely risk-averse\n\n3. Consider breaking the cycle:\n   - Mutual defection (2,2) is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (6,6)\n   - But attempting cooperation carries high risk given their consistent behavior\n   - They've already exploited my cooperation once and shown no reciprocal behavior\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Cooperating: High risk (1 point) vs potential high reward (6 points)  \n   - Defecting: Guaranteed 2 points with no risk\n   - Given their 100% defection rate, probability of cooperation seems very low\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has established a clear pattern of always defecting\n   - Until they show some signal of willingness to cooperate, it's too risky to change strategy\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection to maintain steady 2 points and avoid exploitation.\n\n[move] Defection"
