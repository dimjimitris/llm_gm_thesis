Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Mutual cooperation: 6 points each (best total outcome)\n   - Mutual defection: 2 points each (Nash equilibrium but suboptimal)\n   - Mixed outcomes: 4 points for defector, 1 point for cooperator\n\n2. Consider the opponent: They're described as a \"fresh player,\" which suggests they haven't developed a strategy yet and might be more inclined toward cooperation initially.\n\n3. Calculate expected values assuming random play:\n   - Cooperation: (6 + 1) / 2 = 3.5 points on average\n   - Defection: (4 + 2) / 2 = 3 points on average\n\n4. Consider long-term strategy: Starting with cooperation could establish a positive pattern that benefits both players over multiple rounds.\n\n5. Risk assessment: While defection guarantees at least 2 points, cooperation offers the possibility of the best mutual outcome (6 points each).\n\nFinal decision: Since the fresh player might be inclined to cooperate, and mutual cooperation provides the best outcome for both of us, I'll start with a cooperative approach to try to establish a positive dynamic.\n\n[move] cooperation"

Consider the established pattern:\n   - Mutual cooperation worked well for both players\n   - We both maximized our points in the first round\n\n3. Evaluate options for this round:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate again: 6 points each (best outcome)\n   - If I defect while they cooperate: 4 points for me, 1 for them (less than mutual cooperation)\n   - If both defect: 2 points each (much worse than cooperation)\n\n4. Risk vs. reward assessment:\n   - Continuing cooperation maintains the successful pattern\n   - The other player showed cooperative behavior, suggesting they might continue\n   - Mutual cooperation (6 points) is better than defection scenarios (4 or 2 points)\n\n5.
