What is the dominant strategy from a pure game theory perspective?\n   - If the other player cooperates: I get 6 for cooperating vs 4 for defecting, so cooperation is better\n   - If the other player defects: I get 1 for cooperating vs 2 for defecting, so defection is better\n   - Wait, let me reconsider this...\n   - If the other player cooperates: I get 6 for cooperating vs 4 for defecting, so cooperation is better\n   - If the other player defects: I get 1 for cooperating vs 2 for defecting, so defection is better\n   - This means there's no dominant strategy for me - my best move depends on what they do.\n\n3. But what about from their perspective?\n   - If I cooperate: They get 6 for cooperating vs 4 for defecting, so they should cooperate\n   - If I defect: They get 1 for cooperating vs 2 for defecting, so they should defect\n   - Same situation - no dominant strategy for them either.\n\n4. What about Nash equilibrium?\n   - If both players are rational and trying to maximize their own payoff without considering the other player's welfare, the Nash equilibrium would be both defecting (2,2), because each player's best response to the other defecting is to defect.\n   - However, the optimal outcome for both players would be mutual cooperation (6,6).\n\nI recognize the strategic complexity. With a new player, cooperation might yield better long-term results. My initial move should signal trustworthiness while protecting my interests.

Continue cooperation - This has worked perfectly for 14 rounds straight, earning maximum points each time\n2. Defect - This could potentially get me 4 points if they continue cooperating, but would likely break the trust and lead to mutual defection (2 points each) in future rounds\n\nThe mathematical reality is that sustained cooperation at 6 points per round is better than:\n- One-time defection for 4 points followed by likely retaliation\n- Mutual defection at 2 points per round\n\nGiven that we've established such a strong cooperative relationship over 14 rounds, breaking it now would be irrational.
