This suggests the other player is committed to a cooperative strategy. However, I should consider whether this pattern might continue indefinitely or if there might be some advantage to changing strategy.\n\nIf I defect while they continue to cooperate, I would get 4 points instead of 6, so that would actually be worse for me (-2 points).

But this would likely break the trust and cooperation pattern we've established\n5. If they then defect in future rounds in response, we could end up in a cycle of mutual defection (2 points each) or alternating exploitation\n\nThe current strategy is working extremely well - we're both maximizing our joint outcomes and individual outcomes at 6 points per round. There's no strong strategic reason to deviate from this successful pattern. The risk of breaking this cooperative equilibrium is high, and the potential short-term gain (4 points instead of 6) is actually a loss, not a gain.\n\nI should continue with cooperation.",
