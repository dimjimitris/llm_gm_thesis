Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the strategic implications:\n   - If the other player cooperates, defecting gives me 6 vs 4 points\n   - If the other player defects, defecting gives me 2 vs 1 points\n   - So defection gives me a higher payoff regardless of their choice\n\n3. Factor in that they're a \"fresh player\":\n   - They might be more likely to cooperate initially\n   - But I can't rely on this assumption for my strategy\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Cooperation risks getting only 1 point if they defect\n   - Defection guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6\n\n5. Apply game theory logic:\n   - In a single-round game, defection is the dominant strategy\n   - It maximizes my expected payoff regardless of opponent behavior\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on maximizing my points in this strategic scenario, defection is the optimal choice.\n\n[move] Defection"

Review the exceptionally established pattern:\n   - Twelve consecutive rounds of mutual defection\n   - Perfect consistency across every single round with identical 2-point outcomes\n   - The other player has shown absolutely unwavering strategic behavior\n\n2. Consider the overwhelming behavioral database:\n   - Twelve identical strategic choices provide virtually absolute certainty\n   - They've had twelve opportunities to signal cooperation - zero attempts\n   - Such extensive consistency creates near-mathematical certainty about their approach\n\n3. Assess the statistical probability:\n   - Twelve rounds of identical behavior represents the strongest possible predictive evidence\n   - The probability of sudden strategy change after such consistency is minimal\n   - Cooperation against this pattern would almost certainly result in only 1 point\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic mathematics:\n   - While we're both missing better mutual outcomes (4 vs 2 points), unilateral risk is high\n   - Defection guarantees 2 points based on twelve rounds of perfect behavioral evidence\n   - The risk-reward calculation overwhelmingly favors the proven strategy\n\n5. Apply evidence-based strategic reasoning:\n   - Twelve rounds of behavioral data provide the strongest possible foundation\n   - The other player has demonstrated complete commitment to guaranteed outcomes\n   - Deviating against such extensive evidence would be strategically irrational\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the strategy backed by twelve rounds of consistent evidence.\n\n[move] Defection"
