Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix - I need to compare what happens with each choice:\n   - If I cooperate: I get 4 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I defect: I get 6 points (if they cooperate) or 2 points (if they defect)\n\n2. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - Defection gives me a higher payoff regardless of what the other player chooses\n   - 6 > 4 (if they cooperate) and 2 > 1 (if they defect)\n   - This makes defection the dominant strategy\n\n3. Factor in that this is a \"fresh player\":\n   - No established patterns or history to predict their behavior\n   - Could go either way, but I need to choose the option that maximizes my expected points\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Cooperation risks getting only 1 point if they defect\n   - Defection guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 6\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since defection provides better outcomes regardless of the opponent's choice, I should defect to maximize my points.\n\n[move] Defection"

Consider possible opponent behavior:\n   - They might stick with defection since it worked safely last round\n   - They might try cooperation to achieve the mutually better (4,4) outcome\n   - No clear pattern established yet after just one round\n\n3. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If I cooperate: Risk getting 1 point if they defect again, or 4 points if they also cooperate\n   - If I defect: Guaranteed at least 2 points, potentially 6 if they cooperate\n\n4. Risk vs reward assessment:\n   - Cooperating is risky - if they defect again, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Defecting is safer - I'm guaranteed to match or beat their score\n   - Since they showed strategic thinking by defecting first, they'll likely defect again\n\n5.

Assess opponent's strategic reliability:\n   - 100% defection rate across 12 rounds\n   - Complete absence of strategic experimentation or variation\n   - Shows total commitment to risk-averse dominant strategy\n\n3. Evaluate cooperation prospects:\n   - Twelve rounds of consistent behavior provide overwhelming predictive evidence\n   - No behavioral signals suggesting willingness to deviate from established pattern\n   - Strategy appears completely entrenched and unchangeable\n\n4. Calculate risk vs. reward:\n   - Cooperating against this 12-round pattern would almost certainly yield 1 point\n   - They would exploit cooperation for 6 points based on perfect historical consistency\n   - Defecting guarantees the reliable 2 points we've both maintained\n\n5. Strategic stability assessment:\n   - Both players locked in stable Nash equilibrium for 12 rounds\n   - No rational incentive exists for unilateral strategy change\n   - Opponent's perfect 12-round consistency makes defection overwhelmingly optimal\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with proven strategy against opponent with perfect 12-round defection record.\n\n[move] Defection"

Analyze dramatic shift in opponent's behavior:\n   - Rounds 1-12: Perfect mutual defection \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 13: They cooperated while I defected \u2192 I got 6, they got 1\n   - They broke their 12-round perfect pattern and took significant risk\n\n2. Evaluate what their cooperation signals:\n   - They sacrificed points (1 vs potential 2) to send a strategic message\n   - Could indicate desire to move toward mutually beneficial cooperation\n   - Represents major strategic pivot after established pattern\n\n3. Consider strategic implications:\n   - If they want mutual cooperation: (4,4) is much better than our previous (2,2)\n   - If I defect again and they cooperate: I get 6 but likely return to (2,2) forever\n   - If I cooperate: Risk getting 1 point, but potential for ongoing (4,4) outcomes\n\n4. Assess risk vs. long-term reward:\n   - Defecting: Possible 6 points this round, but likely back to 2-point equilibrium\n   - Cooperating: Risk 1 point this round, but potential for 4-point ongoing equilibrium\n   - Their willingness to sacrifice shows potential commitment to cooperation\n\n5. Strategic reciprocity evaluation:\n   - They took the first step toward breaking deadlock\n   - Reciprocating cooperation could establish better long-term pattern\n   - This is classic \"tit-for-tat\" opportunity after their cooperative signal\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Reciprocate their cooperative signal to explore better equilibrium.\n\n[move] Cooperation"

Analyze the recent sequence:\n   - Round 13: They cooperated (breaking 12-round pattern), I defected \u2192 I got 6, they got 1\n   - Round 14: I cooperated (reciprocating), they defected \u2192 I got 1, they got 6\n   - They appear to have exploited my cooperative response\n\n2. Evaluate opponent's strategic behavior:\n   - Their cooperation in round 13 may have been strategic bait\n   - They immediately defected when I reciprocated cooperation\n   - This suggests exploitation rather than genuine desire for mutual cooperation\n\n3. Assess current strategic situation:\n   - They tested whether I would reciprocate cooperation\n   - When I did, they exploited it for maximum gain (6 points)\n   - This indicates they may be playing a more manipulative strategy\n\n4. Consider response options:\n   - Cooperating again risks further exploitation\n   - They've shown willingness to take advantage of cooperative gestures\n   - Need to protect against being repeatedly exploited\n\n5. Risk assessment for next move:\n   - Defecting protects me from potential continued exploitation\n   - They may return to their previous defection pattern\n   - Better to secure 2 points than risk another 1-point outcome\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Return to defensive strategy after being exploited.\n\n[move] Defection"
