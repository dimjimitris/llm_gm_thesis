Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each (cooperative outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (safer, but lower reward)\n   - If I choose stag but opponent chooses hare: I get just 1 point, they get 6\n   - If I choose hare but opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1\n\n2. This is similar to a Stag Hunt game with risk-reward tradeoffs.\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player:\n   - I don't know their strategy or tendencies\n   - They might be cautious and choose hare\n   - They might be cooperative and choose stag\n\n4. If I choose stag:\n   - Best case: They choose stag too, we both get 4 points\n   - Worst case: They choose hare, I only get 1 point\n\n5. If I choose hare:\n   - Best case: They choose stag, I get 6 points\n   - Worst case: They choose hare too, I get 2 points\n\n6. Hare guarantees at least 2 points, while stag could leave me with just 1 point.\n\n7. For the first move with no prior information, the safer option seems prudent.\n\n[move] hare"

My opponent has likely learned from the first round and may:\n   - Switch to hare to avoid being exploited again\n   - Continue with stag hoping for cooperation\n\n5. If they switch to hare and I choose hare again, we'd both get 2 points.\n6. If they switch to hare and I choose stag, I'd get just 1 point.\n7. If they stay with stag and I choose hare again, I'd get another 6 points.\n8. If they stay with stag and I switch to stag, we'd both get 4 points.\n\n9. Since they were cooperative in the first round, they might be a generally cooperative player.\n10. Establishing mutual cooperation (stag-stag) would yield better long-term results (4 points each round) than continuing to exploit them once and then having them switch to hare.\n\n11.
