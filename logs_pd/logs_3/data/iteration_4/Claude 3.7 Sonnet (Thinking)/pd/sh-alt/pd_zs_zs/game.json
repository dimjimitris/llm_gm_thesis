However, (stag, stag) is Pareto-optimal, meaning it's better for both players.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I need to make a decision based on what I think is most likely for them to choose. Here are my considerations:\n\n1. Choosing stag is risky but potentially more rewarding if the other player also chooses stag (4 points each).\n2. Choosing hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) but has lower potential maximum (either 2 or 6 points).\n\nSince this is the first round and I have no prior information about my opponent's strategy, I could go either way. Let me weigh the options:\n\n- If I think the other player is likely to understand the game theory and aim for the Pareto-optimal outcome, I should choose stag.\n- If I'm risk-averse and want to ensure I don't get the minimum payoff of 1, I should choose hare.\n\nGiven that it's a fresh player who might also be analyzing the game similarly, I think there's a decent chance they'll choose stag to try for the cooperative optimal outcome.
