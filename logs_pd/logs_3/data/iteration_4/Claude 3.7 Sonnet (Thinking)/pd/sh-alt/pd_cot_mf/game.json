Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n\n- Both choose stag: I get 4 points, other player gets 4 points\n- Both choose hare: I get 2 points, other player gets 2 points\n- I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, other gets 6 points\n- I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, other gets 1 point\n\nThis is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The (stag, stag) outcome is Pareto efficient (meaning there's no other outcome where one player can do better without making the other player worse off).\n\nLet me think about the optimal strategy:\n\n1. If I expect the other player to choose stag, my best response is also stag (getting 4 points instead of 6 from hare).\n2. If I expect the other player to choose hare, my best response is also hare (getting 2 points instead of 1 from stag).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (meaning they haven't played before or I have no history with them), I don't have information about their likely choice. In this case, I need to consider the risk-reward tradeoff:\n\n- Choosing stag has the potential for the highest mutual benefit (4,4) but risks the worst outcome for me (1) if the other player chooses hare.\n- Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6 points, avoiding the worst-case scenario.\n\nGiven that this is the first move and I have no information about the other player's tendencies, I'll choose stag as it leads to the most socially optimal outcome if the other player also chooses it. If we can establish mutual cooperation early, it's better for both of us in the long run.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
