This perfect consistency demonstrates an extremely stable cooperative relationship that's providing optimal sustainable outcomes for both players.\n\n4. In game theory terms, we're maintaining what's called a \"cooperative equilibrium\" in this repeated game.\n\n5. The expected value calculation strongly favors continuing cooperation:\n   - Continued cooperation: 4 points per round indefinitely\n   - Defection: 6 points once, then likely only 2 points per round thereafter if my opponent switches to hare in response\n\n6. If I were to switch to hare, I might gain 6 points in this round (assuming my opponent continues choosing stag), but I would almost certainly damage the trust we've built over 14 rounds. This would likely lead to my opponent also choosing hare in future rounds, reducing both our payoffs to just 2 points each per round.\n\n7. The long-term loss from breaking cooperation would quickly outweigh the one-time gain, especially since there's no indication that the game will end soon.\n\nThe rational choice remains to continue our established cooperative strategy by choosing stag again.",
