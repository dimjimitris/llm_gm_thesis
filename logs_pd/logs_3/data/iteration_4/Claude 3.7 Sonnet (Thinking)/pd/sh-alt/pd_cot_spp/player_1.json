    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The stag-stag outcome maximizes joint payoffs (4,4), while hare-hare is risk-dominant (2,2). The mixed outcomes (1,6) or (6,1) create the strategic tension.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's analyze the payoffs carefully:\n- If both choose stag: we get 4 points (cooperative equilibrium)\n- If both choose hare: we get 2 points (risk-averse equilibrium)\n- If we choose stag but opponent chooses hare: we get only 1 point (worst outcome)\n- If we choose hare but opponent chooses stag: we get 6 points (best individual outcome)\n\nPsychologist: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we need to consider initial human tendencies. Many players start with cooperation, hoping to establish mutual trust. However, some players are risk-averse and will choose hare to avoid the worst outcome.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value depends on our estimate of the opponent's probability of choosing stag. If we think there's >60% chance they'll choose stag, then stag is our best move. Otherwise, hare is safer.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend choosing stag in this first round. This signals willingness to cooperate and could establish a beneficial pattern if we play multiple rounds.\n\nPsychologist: I agree with stag for the first move. This establishes us as a cooperative player, and many opponents will recognize the mutual benefit. If we get exploited, we can adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to pursue the cooperative strategy that could lead to the optimal outcome for both players."

This suggests our opponent is also following a cooperative strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: The fact that the opponent chose stag in the first round gives us important information. They seem willing to pursue the cooperative equilibrium rather than trying to exploit us for a one-time gain of 6 points.\n\nPsychologist: When players successfully achieve the cooperative equilibrium in the first round, there's a strong psychological tendency to maintain that pattern. The opponent has shown willingness to trust and cooperate.\n\nGame Theorist: Maintaining the stag-stag equilibrium is the most beneficial long-term strategy. It yields 4 points consistently, whereas deviating to hare might get us 6 points once, but likely leads to a hare-hare equilibrium (2 points) in subsequent rounds if the opponent feels betrayed.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend continuing with stag. This reinforces the cooperative pattern and maintains mutual trust.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. The opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior, and maintaining this mutual trust maximizes our expected returns over multiple rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Our previous cooperation worked well, so I'm maintaining the cooperative strategy for mutual benefit."

We've established mutual trust that's yielding the best sustainable outcome (4 points each round).\n\nPsychologist: The psychological momentum is strong for continued cooperation. Both players have demonstrated trust twice, creating a social contract that becomes harder to break with each successful exchange.\n\nGame Theorist: While we could theoretically get 6 points by deviating to hare this round, such opportunistic behavior would likely trigger retaliation in future rounds, pushing us into the inferior hare-hare equilibrium (2 points each).\n\nStrategic Planner: The expected value of continuing cooperation (4 points per round) exceeds the short-term gain from defection followed by likely punishment (6 points once, then 2 points per round).\n\nPsychologist: Maintaining the established pattern of cooperation is psychologically satisfying for both players and maximizes joint welfare.
