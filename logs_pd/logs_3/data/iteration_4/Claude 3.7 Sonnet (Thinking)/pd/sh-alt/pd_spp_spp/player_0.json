    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Decision Strategist - to help weigh different approaches and outcomes\n3. Risk Analyst - to evaluate the risk/reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a classic Stag Hunt game, where cooperation (both choosing stag) leads to the best collective outcome, but there's risk involved. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Both choose stag: 4 points each (total: 8)\n- Both choose hare: 2 points each (total: 4)\n- One chooses stag, other chooses hare: 1 point vs 6 points\n\nThe \"stag\" option has higher collective benefit but requires mutual trust. The \"hare\" option is safer but yields less overall utility.\n\nDecision Strategist: In the first round, we have no prior information about our opponent's tendencies. We need to decide between maximizing expected value or minimizing risk. If the opponent is rational and seeking to maximize collective benefit, they would choose stag.\n\nRisk Analyst: There's significant downside risk with choosing stag (only getting 1 point if the opponent chooses hare). However, the potential upside of mutual cooperation is substantial. Since this is a fresh player with no history, I'd suggest taking the cooperative approach initially and adjusting based on their behavior.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. Starting with \"stag\" signals willingness to cooperate, which could establish a cooperative pattern. If the opponent betrays this trust, we can adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I'll choose to hunt the stag, aiming for mutual cooperation."

This is the Pareto optimal outcome where both players maximize their collective benefit.\n\nDecision Strategist: The opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior in the first round. In repeated games, it's often beneficial to continue cooperation as long as the other player does the same. This builds trust and maintains the optimal outcome for both parties.\n\nRisk Analyst: The fact that the opponent chose stag in the first round suggests they understand the benefits of cooperation. While there's always a risk they might switch to hare to get the temporary higher payoff (6 points), continuing with stag maintains the cooperative equilibrium which benefits both in the long run.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In repeated games, the most successful strategies often involve reciprocity - continuing to cooperate as long as the opponent does. Since they cooperated in round 1, the rational move is to continue cooperation in round 2. If they were to defect later, we could adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree. Continuing with stag signals our commitment to the cooperative equilibrium, which has the highest sustained payoff for both players over repeated rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I'll continue hunting the stag to maintain our mutually beneficial cooperation."

In repeated games, this strongly suggests they're following a cooperative strategy rather than trying to maximize short-term gains through defection. Continuing with stag maintains our optimal equilibrium.\n\nRisk Analyst: With two rounds of cooperative behavior from our opponent, the risk assessment is shifting further in favor of continuing cooperation. The consistency shown reduces the probability that they'll suddenly switch to hare. The expected value of choosing stag continues to exceed that of choosing hare.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In game theory, this pattern of mutual cooperation in repeated interactions is exactly what we'd hope to establish. The opponent seems to understand that the sustained 4 points per round from stag-stag outcomes exceeds the one-time gain from defecting to hare. I recommend continuing with stag.\n\nDecision Strategist: Agreed.

If we were to defect now, we might gain 6 points once, but would likely lose the cooperative equilibrium in future rounds.\n\nRisk Analyst: After three consistent rounds of cooperation, the risk profile strongly favors continuing with stag.

The opponent has consistently demonstrated they understand and value sustained cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: After twelve rounds of perfect consistency, the risk assessment continues to overwhelmingly favor maintaining our stag strategy. The probability of the opponent suddenly defecting at this point is virtually non-existent. The expected value of continuing cooperation far exceeds any alternative approach.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This game has become a perfect example of what game theorists call a \"stable cooperative equilibrium\" in repeated games. Both players have consistently chosen the option that maximizes collective benefit, and this pattern has become self-reinforcing through repeated consistent choices. Continuing with stag remains the clear optimal choice.\n\nDecision Strategist: I completely agree. With such consistent behavior over an extended series of rounds, maintaining our established cooperative strategy is the rational choice that maximizes expected returns.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I'll continue with stag to maintain our well-established pattern of successful cooperation."
