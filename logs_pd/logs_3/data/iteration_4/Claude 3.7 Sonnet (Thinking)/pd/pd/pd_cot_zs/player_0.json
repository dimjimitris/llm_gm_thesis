    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

In a single-round game, defection would mathematically guarantee a better outcome.\n4. However, if this is a multi-round game, starting with cooperation could establish mutual trust.\n5. Many successful strategies in repeated games (like Tit-for-Tat) start with cooperation.\n6. I want to signal willingness to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome.\n7.

The other player has demonstrated remarkable consistency by choosing cooperation in every single round.\n3. Our mutual cooperation strategy continues to yield the optimal sustainable outcome of 4 points per round.\n4. Reviewing my options again:\n   - Continued mutual cooperation: 4 points each\n   - If I defect while they cooperate: I get 6, they get 1\n   - If I cooperate while they defect: I get 1, they get 6\n   - If we both defect: 2 points each\n5. After fifteen consecutive rounds of cooperation, there is overwhelming evidence that the other player is committed to a cooperative strategy.\n6. The small temporary gain from defection (+2 points) would be immediately negated if the other player switches to defection in response.\n7. Our established pattern of mutual cooperation has proven exceptionally stable and beneficial for both of us.\n8. With such a consistent history, maintaining our successful cooperative relationship remains the rational strategic choice.\n\n[move] cooperation"
