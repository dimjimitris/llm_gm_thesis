The consistency of our interaction strongly suggests maintaining our established pattern.\n\n6. I will continue cooperation for Round 15.\n\n[move] Cooperation",

Let me analyze the situation again:\n\nCurrent game status:\n- 15 rounds of mutual cooperation\n- 4 points earned per round, for a total of 60 points\n- The opponent has shown perfect consistency in choosing cooperation\n\nMy options for Round 16:\n1. Cooperation: Continue earning 4 points if they cooperate again\n2. Defection: Potentially earn 6 points if they cooperate again\n\nWhat's the rational choice here?\n\nThe opponent has shown remarkable consistency in choosing cooperation for 15 straight rounds. There's no reason to believe they'll change their strategy now. If I continue cooperating, we'll both likely earn another 4 points.\n\nIf I defect while they continue cooperating, I would earn 6 points instead of 4 this round - a gain of 2 points. However, this would likely break our established pattern of cooperation. The opponent, seeing my defection, would likely defect in the next round. This would lead to mutual defection (2 points each) rather than mutual cooperation (4 points each).\n\nAfter just one round of mutual defection following my defection, I would have gained 6 + 2 = 8 points over two rounds, whereas with continued cooperation I would have gained 4 + 4 = 8 points. Any additional rounds of mutual defection would make cooperation the superior strategy.\n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence of a consistent cooperative partner and the mathematical advantage of sustained cooperation, I should continue cooperating.",
