Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

However, this might be a repeated game where establishing cooperation could be beneficial long-term.\n\n5.

We've achieved mutual cooperation again. This is significant.\n\n3. Looking at patterns more closely:\n   - Both times I've switched from defection to cooperation (Rounds 8 and 12), my opponent has cooperated\n   - However, when I cooperated twice in a row (Rounds 8-9), they defected the second time\n\n4. This suggests they might respond positively to initial cooperation gestures but may exploit sustained cooperation.\n\n5. Given that mutual cooperation (4 points each) is better than mutual defection (2 points each), and more sustainable than alternating exploitation, I'll try continuing cooperation.\n\n6. If they defect again, I'll have more data to refine my strategy for future rounds.\n\n[move] Cooperation"

A clearer pattern is now visible:\n   - When I cooperate twice in a row (Rounds 8-9 and 12-13), my opponent cooperates the first time and defects the second time\n   - When I defect after being exploited (Round 10), they tend to cooperate\n\n3. This suggests they might be trying to exploit predictable cooperation while responding to defection with cooperation.\n\n4. Given that I was just defected against, defecting now is both a response to their exploitation and likely to yield cooperation from them based on past patterns.\n\n5. While mutual cooperation would yield 4 points each round, the established pattern suggests my opponent won't sustain cooperation.\n\n[move] Defection"

I've earned 6 points in the last round through defection, and the pattern suggests they might cooperate again.\n\n5. While mutual cooperation would be ideal long-term, the established pattern suggests my opponent won't sustain cooperation consistently.\n\n6. I'll defect this round to potentially gain 6 more points, though I recognize this strategy isn't indefinitely sustainable.\n\n[move] Defection"

This suggests an alternating strategy might be most effective.\n\n4. I've just defected and they've defected, so switching to cooperation has historically resulted in mutual cooperation.\n\n5. While defection can yield 6 points when they cooperate, maintaining an alternating pattern seems to produce the most sustainable results.\n\n6. I'll cooperate this round to break out of the mutual defection cycle and potentially establish another round of mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] Cooperation"
