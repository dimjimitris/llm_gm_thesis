For long-term point maximization, mutual cooperation (6 points each) is superior to alternating exploitation (averaging around 2.5-3 points per round).\n\n5. Since the opponent returned to cooperation after my defection, they may be signaling willingness to maintain cooperation going forward.\n\n6. By cooperating now, I can potentially re-establish mutual cooperation and maximize points in the long run.\n\n7.

It seems the opponent is no longer following a strict alternating strategy. Let me think about what this could mean:\n\n1. They might be changing strategies\n2. There might be a more complex pattern I'm missing\n3. They might be responding to my moves in some way\n\nLet me check if there's a pattern based on my moves:\n- When I cooperated in rounds 1,2,4,8,9: They cooperated in 1,8 and defected in 2,4,9\n- When I defected in rounds 3,5,6,7,10,11,12,13: They cooperated in 3,5,10,12,13 and defected in 6,7,11\n\nI don't see a clear pattern based on my moves either.\n\nGiven this uncertainty and the fact they've cooperated twice in a row now, I need to reassess. If they cooperate again, then defection would give me 4 points, but if they defect, then defection would give me 2 points.\n\nGiven the recent unexpected cooperation, I could either:\n1. Continue exploiting their cooperation with defection\n2. Try cooperation to see if we can establish mutual cooperation\n\nSince the opponent has shown willingness to cooperate even when I've defected, it might be worth trying cooperation to see if we can achieve mutual cooperation (6 points each). However, I've been consistently getting 4 points by defecting when they cooperate, which is a reliable strategy given their behavior.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
