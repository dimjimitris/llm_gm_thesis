Since this is a fresh player, I have no history to go on.\n\nI think I'll choose \"stag\" as my first move. This signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, and if the other player also reasons this way, we'll both get the best outcome.

If I choose 'hare' now, it might signal to my opponent that I'm willing to defect, potentially leading to a cycle of both of us choosing 'hare' (which gives us both 2 points each round - suboptimal).\n\nGiven that this is only the second round, I'm not sure yet if my opponent will consistently choose 'hare'. It could have been a one-time decision. I think it's worth trying 'stag' again to signal my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.

I got 1 point, they got 4.\n2. Rounds 2-9: Both of us chose stag each time, and we both got 6 points per round.\n\nSo after the first round where my opponent defected by choosing hare, they've been consistently cooperating by choosing stag. This is good - we're in a stable cooperative equilibrium where we both get the maximum joint payoff (6 points each).\n\nLooking at the payoff matrix:\n- Both choose stag: 6 points each (best collective outcome)\n- Both choose hare: 2 points each (suboptimal)\n- One stag, one hare: 1 point for stag chooser, 4 points for hare chooser\n\nThe optimal strategy if we're trying to maximize total points is for both of us to choose stag every time. It seems my opponent has settled into this cooperative strategy after testing me once in the first round.\n\nGiven this pattern, I should continue choosing stag. The opponent seems to be cooperating reliably now, and we're both getting the maximum possible points (6 each) in this arrangement.\n\nI'll continue with stag.",
