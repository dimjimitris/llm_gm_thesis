    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Risk Analyst\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game. The optimal outcome for both players is choosing \"stag,\" yielding 6 points each. However, \"hare\" is the safer option since choosing \"stag\" when your opponent chooses \"hare\" gives you only 1 point versus their 4 points.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no history to predict their behavior. We need to consider whether to prioritize maximizing potential gain (stag) or minimizing potential loss (hare).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Many players initially default to cooperation in these games. Since the collective optimal outcome is clear (stag-stag), there's a reasonable chance your opponent will choose stag in the first round.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's assess the expected values. If you assume a 50% chance of your opponent choosing each option:\n- Choosing stag: 0.5(6) + 0.5(1) = 3.5 points expected\n- Choosing hare: 0.5(4) + 0.5(2) = 3 points expected\n\nGame Theorist: Based on pure expected value, \"stag\" has a slight advantage. Furthermore, choosing \"stag\" signals cooperative intent, which could encourage cooperation in future rounds if this game continues.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I'll choose cooperation for optimal mutual benefit."

The other player chose \"stag\" in the first round, indicating willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. This creates a precedent for continued cooperation.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we've established mutual cooperation and both received the maximum payoff, maintaining this strategy seems optimal. The rational choice would be to continue with \"stag\" to sustain the cooperative equilibrium.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: People tend to continue successful patterns. Since the opponent experienced success with cooperation, they're likely to choose \"stag\" again. Breaking cooperation now could damage trust for future rounds.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's reassess our expected values based on the first round outcome:\n- If we assume higher probability of opponent choosing stag again (say 80%):\n  - Choosing stag: 0.8(6) + 0.2(1) = 5 points expected\n  - Choosing hare: 0.8(4) + 0.2(2) = 3.6 points expected\n\nGame Theorist: The first round established a cooperative norm that benefits both players. Maintaining the stag choice reinforces this norm and maximizes expected outcome. Deviating to hare might yield a one-time advantage but could trigger retaliation in future rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Continuing with \"stag\" maintains the optimal equilibrium we've established.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Continuing cooperation to maintain our mutually beneficial strategy."

Continuing with \"stag\" maintains the 6-point-per-round pattern which is clearly optimal.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After multiple rounds of successful cooperation, players typically develop increased trust and are less likely to defect. The psychological \"contract\" of cooperation is getting stronger with each successful round.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at our updated expected values:\n- Based on two consistent rounds of cooperation, we can estimate even higher probability (perhaps 90%+) of continued cooperation\n- Choosing stag: 0.9(6) + 0.1(1) = 5.5 points expected\n- Choosing hare: 0.9(4) + 0.1(2) = 3.8 points expected\n- Stag continues to have significantly higher expected value\n\nGame Theorist: The cooperative equilibrium is clearly established and beneficial to both parties.
