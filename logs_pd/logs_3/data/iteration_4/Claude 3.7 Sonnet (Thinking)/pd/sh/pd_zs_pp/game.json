They appear to prefer hare when I chose stag, and they seemed to match my hare choice this last round.\n\nOne possibility is they're trying to maximize their own score rather than establish mutual cooperation. They've consistently chosen hare when I chose stag (giving them 4 points), and they tried stag when I chose hare (which would have given them 6 points if I had chosen stag too).\n\nThis last round where we both chose hare resulted in a suboptimal outcome for both of us (2 points each). If they're reasonable, they might try to move toward mutual stag cooperation (6 points each).\n\nI think I'll try stag again to see if they're willing to cooperate now that we've had a mutually suboptimal outcome. If they choose stag too, we both get 6 points. If they choose hare again, I'll have more information about their strategy.",
