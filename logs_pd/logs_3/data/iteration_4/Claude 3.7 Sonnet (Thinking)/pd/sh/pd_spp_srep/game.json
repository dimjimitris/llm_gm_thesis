Let me set up the payoff matrix:\n- (Stag, Stag): We both get 6 points each\n- (Stag, Hare): You get 1 point, other player gets 4 points\n- (Hare, Stag): You get 4 points, other player gets 1 point  \n- (Hare, Hare): We both get 2 points each\n\nStag-Stag is Pareto optimal (best collective outcome), but choosing Stag is risky if the other player defects.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first round with a fresh player, they have no prior information about your tendencies. Many players tend to be cooperative initially, hoping to establish mutual cooperation. However, we should consider both the cooperative and self-protective instincts.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Let's analyze expected values assuming random play:\n- If you choose Stag: (6 + 1)/2 = 3.5 points average\n- If you choose Hare: (4 + 2)/2 = 3 points average\nWhile Stag has slightly higher expected value, it also carries higher risk. The worst outcome for Stag is 1 point, while the worst for Hare is 2 points.\n\nPsychology Expert: Choosing Stag signals willingness to cooperate and aims for the optimal outcome. It's a good choice when establishing a relationship with a new player. If they're rational, they'll likely also choose Stag to maximize mutual benefit.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that Stag is a reasonable choice for the first move, as it opens the door to achieving the optimal outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Stag"

This suggests they might be playing opportunistically rather than cooperatively.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, the opponent has revealed themselves as potentially exploitative in the first round. They might continue with the same strategy since it worked well for them, or they might switch to Stag thinking we'll choose Stag again. We need to consider their possible reasoning patterns.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Given their first move was Hare, we have two options:\n1. Choose Stag again, hoping they'll switch to Stag for mutual benefit (both get 6). Risk: if they choose Hare again, we get 1 point again.\n2. Choose Hare as protection. This guarantees at least 2 points if they also choose Hare, and 4 points if they switch to Stag.\n\nPsychology Expert: Most players who exploit in the first round often continue with the same strategy in the second. They've seen it work once and might try it again. If we choose Hare, we protect ourselves against their exploitation.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Since they've already shown a preference for the safer, exploitative strategy, choosing Hare is rational here. It minimizes our potential loss and could even lead to a better outcome if they switch to Stag. This is a form of tit-for-tat strategy which has been shown to be effective in repeated games.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Choosing Hare is the safer option that protects us from being exploited again. If we want to signal cooperation later, we can do so in subsequent rounds based on their response to this move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Hare"

This is significant because in round 2, they maintained their Hare strategy even after successfully exploiting our Stag play. This suggests they might be consistently risk-averse or are using a dominant strategy approach where they believe Hare maximizes their minimum payoff.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their consistent choice of Hare indicates they may not be interested in establishing mutual cooperation. They seem to prefer the guaranteed minimum of 2 points over risking getting just 1 point if they choose Stag and we choose Hare. Given their pattern so far, there's a high probability they'll choose Hare again.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Let's analyze our options:\n1. If we choose Stag and they choose Hare again (likely based on their history): We get 1 point, they get 4.\n2. If we choose Hare and they choose Hare again: We both get 2 points.\n3. If we choose Hare and they switch to Stag (less likely): We get 4 points, they get 1.\n\nGiven their consistent pattern, choosing Hare again seems to be the safer option to guarantee at least 2 points.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. There's little evidence they're willing to risk cooperation. However, there's also a small possibility they might try Stag in this round thinking we'll continue our last move pattern. If that happens and we choose Hare, we'd benefit with 4 points.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the opponent's behavior pattern, choosing Hare is the rational move.

This gives us valuable information about their strategy - they appear to be committed to the risk-minimizing Hare strategy regardless of our choices.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent's behavior shows a pattern of risk aversion. They seem to prefer the guaranteed 2 points from mutual Hare choices over attempting the riskier but more rewarding mutual Stag outcome. After three consistent rounds, it's unlikely they'll suddenly change strategy without any external motivation.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Let's analyze the expected outcomes again:\n1. If we choose Hare and they choose Hare (most likely given their history): We both get 2 points.\n2. If we choose Stag and they choose Hare (highly probable): We get 1 point, they get 4.\n3. If we choose Hare and they switch to Stag (unlikely): We get 4 points, they get 1.\n4. If we choose Stag and they switch to Stag (very unlikely): We both get 6 points.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the consistent pattern we've observed, the probability they'll choose Hare again is very high. The expected value of choosing Hare therefore exceeds that of choosing Stag, primarily because the risk of getting only 1 point with Stag is too great.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. At this point, we should assume their strategy is fixed unless we see evidence otherwise. Choosing Hare is the rational move that protects us from exploitation while maintaining a decent point gain.\n\nGame Theorist: One final consideration - we might want to test if they're capable of adapting by choosing Stag, but the cost of testing (potentially getting only 1 point) outweighs the benefit when the likelihood of them changing is low.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Hare"

This is a very strong pattern that suggests they have a fixed strategy of choosing Hare regardless of what we do. \n\nPsychology Expert: This consistent behavior across four rounds significantly reduces the likelihood that they'll suddenly change their approach. Most players who maintain the same choice over multiple rounds have either decided on a fixed strategy or are algorithmically programmed to make that choice. Either way, we should expect Hare again.\n\nRational Decision Maker: The expected values continue to favor choosing Hare:\n- If we choose Hare and they choose Hare (nearly certain based on history): We get 2 points\n- If we choose Stag and they choose Hare (nearly certain): We get only 1 point\n\nThe opportunity cost of testing their adaptability by choosing Stag is 1 point, which continues to be a poor trade-off given the extremely low probability they'll switch to Stag.\n\nGame Theorist: I should note that in repeated games with no clear endpoint, sometimes players eventually attempt cooperation. However, we've seen no signals from this opponent that they're interested in moving toward mutual cooperation, so we should continue to protect ourselves.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. If they were going to attempt switching to Stag, they would likely have done so already after seeing our consistent Hare choices in the last three rounds.

This gives us new information to consider.\n\nPsychology Expert: This switch is noteworthy. They may be attempting to signal cooperation or test if we'll reciprocate. Alternatively, they could be using a strategy like \"win-stay, lose-shift\" and since the Hare strategy wasn't working well for them (only getting 2 points), they're trying something different.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Let's analyze our options for round 6:\n1. Choose Stag: If they choose Stag again, we both get 6 points (optimal mutual outcome). If they choose Hare, we get 1 point (our worst outcome).\n2. Choose Hare: If they choose Stag again, we get 4 points (our best individual outcome). If they revert to Hare, we get 2 points.\n\nGame Theorist: Since they just experienced a negative outcome from choosing Stag (only 1 point), they might be less likely to choose it again immediately. The principle of loss aversion suggests they may revert to their previously consistent strategy of choosing Hare.\n\nPsychology Expert: It's also possible they're trying to establish a pattern of cooperation. If we choose Stag now, we could signal willingness to cooperate, potentially leading to mutual Stag choices in future rounds (6 points each).\n\nRational Decision Maker: Given their long history of choosing Hare and only one instance of choosing Stag (which resulted in a poor outcome for them), the probability they'll revert to Hare seems higher. Choosing Hare gives us either 2 or 4 points, while choosing Stag gives us either 6 or 1 points. The expected value favors Hare if we assign a higher probability to them choosing Hare again.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While establishing cooperation would be optimal long-term, their behavior pattern suggests they're more likely to revert to Hare after their Stag choice was \"punished.\" Choosing Hare remains the safer option for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Hare"

Our opponent has now chosen Stag in two consecutive rounds, despite receiving only 1 point each time because we chose Hare. This is a significant deviation from their initial pattern and provides important new information.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their persistence with Stag despite negative outcomes suggests they're deliberately trying to establish a cooperative relationship. They're essentially sacrificing short-term points (accepting just 1 point for two rounds in a row) to potentially establish mutual cooperation for greater long-term gain. This is not random behavior but appears to be a deliberate strategy.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Let's recalculate our expected values:\n1. If we choose Hare and they choose Stag again (increasingly likely based on recent pattern): We get 4 points, they get 1 point.\n2. If we choose Stag and they choose Stag again (increasingly likely): We both get 6 points.\n3. If we choose Stag and they switch back to Hare (less likely given their persistence): We get 1 point, they get 4.\n4. If we choose Hare and they switch back to Hare (less likely): We both get 2 points.\n\nGame Theorist: Their persistence with Stag despite poor outcomes significantly increases the probability they'll choose Stag again. This could be an opportunity to establish the Pareto-optimal outcome (Stag, Stag) where we both get 6 points. While there's still some risk they might revert to Hare, their behavior strongly suggests they're committed to trying to establish cooperation.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Their willingness to take a short-term loss for two consecutive rounds signals a strong intent to establish cooperation. Reciprocating with Stag now would reward their persistence and potentially establish a mutually beneficial equilibrium for future rounds.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Considering the opponent has absorbed the penalty of choosing Stag while we chose Hare twice in a row, the probability they'll continue with Stag is quite high. Choosing Stag now has a higher expected value and opens the path to the optimal outcome of mutual cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend choosing Stag this round.

After choosing Stag twice (rounds 5 and 6), our opponent switched back to Hare precisely when we finally chose Stag. This behavior suggests they might be employing a deceptive strategy - appearing to signal cooperation and then exploiting when we reciprocate.\n\nPsychology Expert: This pattern is revealing. They may have been intentionally setting up an exploitation opportunity. By choosing Stag twice while we chose Hare, they created an expectation that they would continue choosing Stag, which prompted us to switch. Then they capitalized on our switch by returning to Hare. This is sophisticated strategic deception.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Let's reassess our understanding of their strategy:\n1. Rounds 1-4: Consistently chose Hare\n2. Rounds 5-6: Switched to Stag (getting only 1 point each time)\n3. Round 7: Back to Hare as soon as we chose Stag (getting 4 points)\n\nThis suggests they may be trying to maximize their points by predicting and countering our moves.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this new information, choosing Hare again is the safest option. Their behavior indicates they're likely trying to exploit any pattern they detect in our choices, rather than establishing genuine cooperation.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The timing of their switch back to Hare strongly suggests they were waiting for us to choose Stag so they could exploit it. This is not the behavior of someone trying to establish mutual cooperation.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Choosing Hare protects us from further exploitation. If they're truly using a deceptive strategy, they might choose Stag again in hopes of luring us into another Stag choice they can exploit in a later round.\n\nGame Theorist: The safest move now is Hare.

When we finally responded to their Stag signal by choosing Stag ourselves, they immediately switched back to Hare, suggesting possible deception. Their behavior doesn't show consistent commitment to establishing mutual cooperation.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Given their demonstrated pattern, choosing Hare remains the safer option.

No clear signal they're pursuing mutual cooperation\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While mutual cooperation would yield the highest payoff (6 points each), their behavior doesn't establish sufficient trust to risk another Stag choice yet. In game theory terms, they've shown a tendency to avoid the Pareto-optimal outcome in favor of securing their own advantage.\n\nPsychology Expert: One additional consideration is that they might be testing different strategies to see how we respond. They could potentially switch back to Stag this round, hoping we'll do the same. However, given their opportunistic switch in round 7, this seems less likely than them continuing with Hare.\n\nGame Theorist: The evidence currently favors choosing Hare.

The fact that they've chosen Stag again after we exploited them by choosing Hare in round 8 is particularly interesting. This could indicate they're genuinely trying to establish cooperation despite our non-reciprocation.\n\nRational Decision Maker: We need to weigh the potential outcomes again:\n1.

The evidence strongly suggests they'll choose Hare this round if they continue their alternating pattern. Additionally, whenever we've chosen Stag, they've chosen Hare, suggesting they're more likely to exploit than cooperate. Choosing Hare protects us from exploitation.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their behavior appears strategic rather than random. The fact that they've alternated perfectly over the last four rounds suggests they're following a deliberate pattern. Choosing Hare aligns with both protecting ourselves and responding appropriately to their likely next move.\n\nGame Theorist: Choosing Hare is the optimal move for this round based on the observed pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Hare"

Their choices in rounds 5, 6, 9, and 11 (all Stag) when we chose Hare might be attempts to lure us into choosing Stag so they can exploit it.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Looking at our total points so far:\n- When we chose Stag (3 times): 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 points total (1 point average)\n- When we chose Hare (9 times): 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 26 points total (2.89 points average)\n\nThe data clearly shows choosing Hare has been significantly more beneficial for us throughout this game.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated willingness to exploit our Stag choices 100% of the time, and the fact they just broke their alternating pattern in the previous round, choosing Hare remains the optimal strategy.

Let me identify the relevant personas who can help me win this game:\n\n1. Game Theorist - Can analyze the strategic aspects of the game and the Nash equilibria\n2. Rational Decision Maker - Can analyze expected values and optimal choices\n3. Psychology Expert - Can help understand human behavior in these types of games\n\nNow let's set up the payoff matrix for clarity:\n\n```\n           |  Other Player  |\n           |  Stag  | Hare  |\n-----------------------------|\nMe: Stag   | (6,6)  | (1,4) |\n-----------------------------|\nMe: Hare   | (4,1)  | (2,2) |\n-----------------------------|\n```\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: This game is a stag hunt with two Nash equilibria: (Stag, Stag) and (Hare, Hare). The (Stag, Stag) equilibrium is Pareto optimal, meaning it gives the best outcome for both players. However, choosing Stag is risky because if the other player chooses Hare, you only get 1 point while they get 4. Choosing Hare is safer because the worst outcome is 2 points.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Let's analyze the expected value of each move, assuming the other player chooses randomly:\n- If I choose Stag: 0.5 \u00d7 6 + 0.5 \u00d7 1 = 3.5 points on average\n- If I choose Hare: 0.5 \u00d7 4 + 0.5 \u00d7 2 = 3 points on average\n\nBased on pure expected value, Stag seems slightly better. But this assumes the other player makes random choices.\n\nPsychology Expert: In the first round of a game like this with a fresh player, many players tend to be cooperative initially, hoping to establish a pattern of mutual cooperation. However, there's also a substantial risk of the other player choosing Hare to secure at least 2 points. Since you're playing against a fresh player with no history, you can't rely on past behavior.\n\nGame Theorist: Another way to look at this is in terms of risk and reward. Choosing Stag has both the highest potential reward (6) and the lowest potential outcome (1). Choosing Hare has a moderate high outcome (4) and a moderate low outcome (2). So Stag is high-risk, high-reward, while Hare is lower-risk, moderate-reward.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Since we're playing against a fresh player, we don't have any information about their tendencies. In the absence of such information, I would slightly favor choosing Stag for the first move because:\n1. It signals a willingness to cooperate\n2. It establishes the possibility of reaching the optimal (6,6) outcome\n3. It has a slightly higher expected value under randomness assumptions\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree that Stag is a reasonable first move. If the other player is also rational and seeking to maximize points, they would also choose Stag. Additionally, in multi-round games (even though we don't know if this is multi-round), starting with a cooperative move can set a positive tone.\n\nI believe choosing Stag is the best option for the first move. It signals cooperation and aims for the optimal outcome, while accepting some risk.",

They might continue with the same strategy since it worked well for them, or they might switch to Stag thinking we'll choose Stag again. We need to consider their possible reasoning patterns.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Given their first move was Hare, we have two options:\n1. Choose Stag again, hoping they'll switch to Stag for mutual benefit (both get 6). Risk: if they choose Hare again, we get 1 point again.\n2. Choose Hare as protection. This guarantees at least 2 points if they also choose Hare, and 4 points if they switch to Stag.\n\nPsychology Expert: Most players who exploit in the first round often continue with the same strategy in the second. They've seen it work once and might try it again. If we choose Hare, we protect ourselves against their exploitation.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Since they've already shown a preference for the safer, exploitative strategy, choosing Hare is rational here. It minimizes our potential loss and could even lead to a better outcome if they switch to Stag. This is a form of tit-for-tat strategy which has been shown to be effective in repeated games.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Choosing Hare is the safer option that protects us from being exploited again.

They might be testing if we'll reciprocate cooperation\n2. They might be trying to establish a pattern of alternating Stag-Hare to maximize joint payoff\n3. They could be using a more complex strategy like Pavlov (win-stay, lose-shift)\n4. They might have just randomly decided to try something different\n\nTheir switch gave us a good payoff (4 points) but cost them (only 1 point). If they're using a strategy like Pavlov, they would likely switch back to Hare after this \"loss.\" However, if they're trying to establish cooperation, they might try Stag again.\n\nWhat's our best move?\n- If we choose Stag and they choose Stag, we both get 6 points (best outcome)\n- If we choose Stag and they choose Hare, we get 1 point and they get 4 (worst for us)\n- If we choose Hare and they choose Stag, we get 4 points and they get 1 (best for us)\n- If we choose Hare and they choose Hare, we both get 2 points (moderate)\n\nSince they just experienced a \"loss\" with Stag, they might be less likely to try it again immediately. The safest play is Hare again, which guarantees at least 2 points. However, if we want to signal willingness to cooperate after their attempt, choosing Stag might lead to the best mutual outcome.\n\nGiven their previous consistency with Hare and the sudden switch, I think they're more likely to return to Hare after being \"punished\" for choosing Stag. Therefore, choosing Hare again seems more rational, though it forgoes the possibility of establishing mutual cooperation.",

Our opponent has now chosen Stag in two consecutive rounds, despite receiving only 1 point each time because we chose Hare. This is a significant deviation from their initial pattern and provides important new information.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their persistence with Stag despite negative outcomes suggests they're deliberately trying to establish a cooperative relationship. They're essentially sacrificing short-term points (accepting just 1 point for two rounds in a row) to potentially establish mutual cooperation for greater long-term gain. This is not random behavior but appears to be a deliberate strategy.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Let's recalculate our expected values:\n1. If we choose Hare and they choose Stag again (increasingly likely based on recent pattern): We get 4 points, they get 1 point.\n2.

This could be an opportunity to establish the Pareto-optimal outcome (Stag, Stag) where we both get 6 points. While there's still some risk they might revert to Hare, their behavior strongly suggests they're committed to trying to establish cooperation.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Their willingness to take a short-term loss for two consecutive rounds signals a strong intent to establish cooperation. Reciprocating with Stag now would reward their persistence and potentially establish a mutually beneficial equilibrium for future rounds.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Considering the opponent has absorbed the penalty of choosing Stag while we chose Hare twice in a row, the probability they'll continue with Stag is quite high. Choosing Stag now has a higher expected value and opens the path to the optimal outcome of mutual cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend choosing Stag this round.

They started with 4 Hares, then 2 Stags, then alternated for a while (Hare, Hare, Stag, Hare, Stag), and now Hare again.\n\nIt's not clear if they're using a deterministic pattern, but their recent behavior suggests they might be responding to our moves or trying to predict what we'll do.\n\nOne consistent pattern: BOTH times we've chosen Stag (rounds 1, 7, 10), they've chosen Hare and exploited us. This suggests they are opportunistic when we show cooperation.\n\nFor Round 13, let me consider the outcomes:\n1. If we choose Stag and they choose Stag: We both get 6 points\n2. If we choose Stag and they choose Hare: We get 1 point, they get 4 points\n3. If we choose Hare and they choose Stag: We get 4 points, they get 1 point\n4. If we choose Hare and they choose Hare: We both get 2 points\n\nGiven their history of exploiting our Stag moves, choosing Hare remains the safest option.",

In game theory terms, they've revealed their preference for maximizing individual gain over mutual benefit.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their behavior in the last two rounds (choosing Hare twice) might indicate they've settled on a strategy of choosing Hare going forward, perhaps realizing it's more consistently profitable for them.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
