    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Decision Optimizer\n\nGame Theory Strategist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game where cooperation (stag) yields the highest mutual benefit, but comes with risk. The payoff structure favors mutual cooperation, but choosing stag when the opponent chooses hare is the worst outcome for you.\n\nRisk Analyzer: Let's compare the outcomes:\n- If you choose stag: 6 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare)\n- If you choose hare: 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\nHare guarantees at least 2 points, while stag could leave you with just 1 point.\n\nDecision Optimizer: However, stag offers the highest potential reward (6 points). Since this is the first round with a fresh player, many players tend to start with cooperative moves to establish positive interaction. The potential upside of choosing stag outweighs the risk, especially since repeated cooperation can lead to better outcomes over time.\n\nGame Theory Strategist: I agree. Starting with stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, which could establish a beneficial pattern.\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing to cooperate for our mutual benefit."

This suggests our opponent understands the benefit of cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyzer: The first round gives us valuable information - the other player chose stag, showing a willingness to cooperate. This reduces the perceived risk of choosing stag again since we now have evidence of their cooperative tendency.\n\nDecision Optimizer: With cooperation established, continuing with stag is likely to maintain the optimal outcome. Consistent cooperation in repeated games tends to reinforce cooperative behavior from both parties. The expected value of choosing stag is now higher based on our observed history.\n\nGame Theory Strategist: In repeated Stag Hunt games, when cooperation is established, the rational move is to continue cooperation unless there's reason to believe the other player might defect. I see no such indication here.\n\n[move] stag I'll continue cooperating for our mutual benefit."

After two rounds of cooperation, the likelihood of the opponent continuing to choose stag is high. The expected value of choosing stag is now significantly higher than choosing hare.\n\nDecision Optimizer: In repeated games like this, once a cooperative equilibrium is established, maintaining it maximizes long-term gains. Deviating to hare would yield a one-time gain of 4 points instead of 6, but risks disrupting future cooperation, potentially leading to both players choosing hare (only 2 points each) in subsequent rounds.\n\nGame Theory Strategist: The optimal strategy in this situation is clear - continue cooperation as it benefits both parties equally and maximally.\n\n[move] stag Continuing with cooperation as it's working well for both of us."

While switching to hare could theoretically yield 4 points if they continue with stag, this would likely disrupt future cooperation and reduce total points over time.
