I could continue with \"stag\" hoping they return to cooperation, but risk being exploited again.\n2. I could switch to \"hare\" to protect myself from exploitation (getting at least 2 points instead of 1 if they choose \"hare\" again).\n3.

The best mutual outcome is when both choose \"stag\" (6,6), but there's a safer equilibrium at both choosing \"hare\" (2,2). \n\nGiven that my opponent has already defected once, I think the prudent move is to switch to \"hare\" for this round.
