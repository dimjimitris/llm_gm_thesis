We've maintained perfect cooperation throughout the entire game\n3. The other player has demonstrated unwavering commitment to the optimal cooperative strategy\n4. Our mutual stag approach has consistently yielded the maximum possible points (6 per round)\n5. Any deviation would:\n   - Result in immediate point reduction (at most 4 instead of 6)\n   - Break the established trust and successful pattern\n   - Potentially trigger less beneficial outcomes in future rounds\n6. With such a long and consistent history of successful cooperation and maximum point accumulation, continuing our proven optimal strategy remains the clear best choice\n\n[move] stag",

The other player has consistently chosen stag, indicating they are committed to the cooperative strategy that yields the maximum mutual benefit.\n\nIf I were to switch to hare now:\n- If the other player continues choosing stag (which seems likely given their history), I would get 4 points instead of 6\n- This would break the established pattern of cooperation\n- It might cause the other player to switch to hare in future rounds, resulting in both of us earning only 2 points per round instead of 6\n\nGiven the consistent history of successful cooperation and the clear benefits of maintaining this strategy, there is no logical reason to change my approach. Continuing to choose stag remains the optimal choice to maximize points.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
