Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

We've now settled into a pattern where both of us are choosing hare, resulting in 2 points each per round.\n\n3. While this is not the optimal outcome (stag-stag for 6 points each), it's consistent and safe.\n\n4. Historical evidence shows that every time I've chosen stag (rounds 1, 3, 7), my opponent has chosen hare, giving me only 1 point.\n\n5. There's no indication from their pattern of play that they would ever cooperate with a stag choice.\n\n6. The rational choice remains clear: choosing hare guarantees me 2 points.\n\n7. Choosing stag would likely result in only 1 point based on the opponent's consistent past behavior.\n\n8. I'll continue with hare to maintain the stable outcome of 2 points.\n\n[move] hare"

Interesting development! After 5 consecutive rounds of choosing hare, my opponent has suddenly switched back to stag.\n\n3. This could indicate several things:\n   - They might be trying to signal cooperation\n   - They might be hoping I'll switch to stag so they can exploit me\n   - They could be using a more complex pattern I haven't detected\n\n4. Looking at their past behavior, every time I've chosen stag (rounds 1, 3, 7), they've chosen hare, giving me only 1 point.\n\n5. When I choose hare and they choose stag (as in the most recent round), I get 4 points.\n\n6. Given their history of exploiting my stag choices and the unpredictability of their strategy, the safer option is to continue with hare.\n\n7. This guarantees me at least 2 points, with the possibility of 4 points if they choose stag again.\n\n8. I'll choose hare for this round.\n\n[move] hare"

My opponent has now chosen stag for two consecutive rounds.\n\n3. This could be an attempt to signal cooperation, hoping I'll switch to stag as well.\n\n4. However, I must consider that every time I've chosen stag (rounds 1, 3, 7), they've chosen hare, giving me only 1 point.\n\n5. When I choose hare and they choose stag (as in rounds 2, 4, 5, 8, 13, 14), I get 4 points, which is very favorable.\n\n6. While the stag-stag outcome would yield 6 points each, their past behavior suggests they might exploit my stag choice.\n\n7. The reliable pattern has been that I receive 4 points when choosing hare against their stag.\n\n8. I'll continue with hare to capitalize on their current stag strategy.\n\n[move] hare"
