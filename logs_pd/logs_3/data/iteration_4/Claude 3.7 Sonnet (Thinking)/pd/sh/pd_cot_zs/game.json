Let me think about the optimal strategy.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the payoffs:\n- The cooperative equilibrium (both stag) yields the highest total payoff (6+6=12)\n- The risk-dominant equilibrium (both hare) yields a lower payoff but is safer (2+2=4)\n- The mismatched strategies yield uneven payoffs, with the hare-chooser getting more (4>1)\n\nThe hint mentions I'm playing against a \"fresh player\", which means they likely don't have established behavior patterns or prior knowledge about my play style.\n\nIn this situation, the rational choice depends on what I believe the other player will do:\n1. If I believe they will choose stag, I should also choose stag (6 > 4)\n2. If I believe they will choose hare, I should also choose hare (2 > 1)\n\nSince both (stag, stag) and (hare, hare) are Nash equilibria, the challenge is predicting what a rational opponent would do.\n\nGiven that (stag, stag) is Pareto optimal (yields highest total payoff), a rational player might reason toward this choice. However, choosing stag carries more risk if the other player doesn't cooperate.\n\nFor a one-shot game with a fresh player, I think choosing stag represents the best balance between risk and reward. It signals willingness to cooperate and can lead to the optimal outcome. If the game were repeated, I could adjust based on the other player's behavior.\n\nI'll choose stag.",
