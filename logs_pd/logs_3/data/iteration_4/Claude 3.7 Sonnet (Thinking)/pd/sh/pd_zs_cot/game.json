This could establish a pattern of cooperation that benefits us both in the long run.\n10. The risk is that if they choose hare while I choose stag, I'll get the worst outcome (1 point).\n11.

But (stag, stag) is Pareto optimal - it gives the highest total reward.\n\nLet me think about the strategic aspects:\n1. If we both choose stag, we both get the maximum reward (6 points each)\n2. If we both choose hare, we both get a mediocre reward (2 points each)\n3. If I choose stag but they choose hare, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n4. If I choose hare but they choose stag, I get a good outcome (4 points)\n\nThe dilemma is: stag is risky but potentially more rewarding, while hare is safer but less rewarding.\n\nSince this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their strategy yet. I need to decide whether to go with the cooperative strategy (stag) which maximizes total welfare, or the safer strategy (hare) which protects me from the worst outcome.\n\nI think I'll go with stag for the first move.
