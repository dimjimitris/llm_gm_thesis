This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma game where the collective optimal outcome is cooperation, but there's individual incentive to defect.\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n4. In such situations, I'll start with cooperation to:\n   - Signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n   - Establish potential for long-term cooperation\n   - Potentially achieve the highest mutual outcome (6 points each)\n\n5. While defection might yield more points in a single round if the opponent cooperates, cooperation allows for building trust that could lead to sustained mutual cooperation.\n\n6. The risk is that the opponent defects, leaving me with only 1 point, but this is a risk worth taking to establish potential cooperation.\n\n7. If the opponent defects in this round, I can adjust my strategy in future rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose cooperation for this first round.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

I now have evidence that the opponent is willing to cooperate, which gives me more confidence in choosing cooperation again.\n\n5. By continuing to cooperate, I can reinforce this positive pattern and potentially establish ongoing mutual cooperation.\n\n6. If I defected now, I might gain 4 points in this round (if they cooperate again), but this would likely damage trust and lead to mutual defection in future rounds, where we would both only get 2 points each.\n\n7. The long-term expected value of sustained cooperation (6 points per round) significantly outweighs the short-term gain from defection followed by potential punishment.\n\n8.

This extended sequence of mutual cooperation represents the optimal outcome in this game, having maximized both individual and collective benefits over a significant period.\n\n5.

The expected value calculation remains overwhelmingly in favor of continuing cooperation:\n   - Sustained cooperation: 6 points per round indefinitely\n   - Defection: A one-time gain of at most 4 points, likely followed by retaliation and substantially reduced earnings thereafter\n\n7. After fourteen successful rounds, our cooperative relationship has proven extraordinarily stable and beneficial - any deviation would be irrational and counterproductive.\n\n8.
