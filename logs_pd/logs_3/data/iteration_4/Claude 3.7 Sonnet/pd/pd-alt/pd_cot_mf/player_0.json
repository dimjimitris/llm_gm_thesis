Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n   - If both cooperate: both get 6 points\n   - If both defect: both get 2 points\n   - If I cooperate and opponent defects: I get 1 point, opponent gets 4 points\n   - If I defect and opponent cooperates: I get 4 points, opponent gets 1 point\n\n2. This is a classic prisoner's dilemma. While mutual cooperation yields the highest collective score (12 points), there's temptation to defect.\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I don't have information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n4. Starting with cooperation has several advantages:\n   - It establishes goodwill\n   - It opens the possibility for mutual cooperation (highest point outcome)\n   - It signals willingness to achieve the optimal collective outcome\n\n5. The risk is that my opponent might exploit my cooperation by defecting, but establishing a cooperative norm early might lead to better outcomes in the long run.\n\n6. In the absence of prior history with this player, cooperation seems like a reasonable starting position.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

The perfect pattern of cooperation across thirteen rounds represents an exceptionally strong indication of a stable, mutually beneficial relationship.\n\n4.

The probability of my opponent continuing to cooperate is effectively certain based on:\n   - Their unwavering choice of cooperation across thirteen consecutive rounds\n   - The consistent mutual benefit we've both experienced\n   - The strong cooperative norm that has been established\n\n6. Game theory research on iterated prisoner's dilemma shows that after this many consistent rounds, the cooperative pattern becomes deeply entrenched, with both players recognizing its optimal nature.\n\n7. From a mathematical perspective, the expected value calculation overwhelmingly favors cooperation:\n   - Cooperation: 6 points with near certainty\n   - Defection: Potentially 4 points once, but almost certainly followed by worse outcomes in future rounds\n\n8. The evidence from our interaction is so extensive and consistent that any rational analysis must conclude that:\n   - Cooperation has been unambiguously successful\n   - The pattern is extremely unlikely to change\n   - Maintaining cooperation is the clearly optimal choice\n\n9.

Our accumulated points have reached 84 each (14 rounds \u00d7 6 points), demonstrating the exceptional stability and success of our cooperative strategy.\n\n3. The perfect pattern of cooperation across fourteen rounds represents an extraordinarily strong foundation of mutual trust and understanding.\n\n4. At this mature stage of our interaction, several principles are firmly established:\n   - Our cooperative equilibrium has proven remarkably stable\n   - Both players clearly recognize and commit to the optimal approach\n   - The pattern shows extraordinary reliability and consistency\n\n5. The probability of my opponent continuing to cooperate approaches absolute certainty given:\n   - Their unwavering choice of cooperation across fourteen consecutive rounds without a single deviation\n   - The significant accumulated mutual benefit we've both experienced\n   - The deeply established norm of reciprocal cooperation\n\n6. Research in behavioral game theory indicates that after this many consistent exchanges, the cooperative pattern becomes so deeply established that it would be highly unusual for either player to suddenly deviate.\n\n7. The expected value calculation at this point is overwhelmingly clear:\n   - Cooperation: 6 points with virtually certain probability\n   - Defection: Potentially 4 points once, but almost certainly followed by mutual defection (2 points) or worse in future rounds\n\n8. Our interaction represents a textbook example of how cooperation can emerge as the stable, dominant strategy in repeated games when both players recognize its mutual benefit.\n\n9.

The perfect pattern of cooperation across fifteen rounds represents an exceptionally strong and stable cooperative relationship.\n\n4. At this highly advanced stage of our interaction, several key observations are evident:\n   - Our cooperative equilibrium has proven remarkably resilient\n   - Both players have demonstrated complete commitment to optimal play\n   - The pattern shows extraordinary stability with no signs of deviation\n\n5. The probability of my opponent continuing to cooperate is effectively certain based on:\n   - Their unwavering choice of cooperation across fifteen consecutive rounds\n   - The substantial mutual benefit we've both accumulated\n   - The deeply established norm of reciprocal cooperation that has formed\n\n6. Game theory research on extended interactions shows that after this many consistent rounds, the cooperative pattern becomes so deeply ingrained that deviation becomes increasingly irrational with each successive exchange.\n\n7. From a mathematical expectation perspective, the calculation overwhelmingly favors continued cooperation:\n   - Expected value of cooperation: 6 points (based on fifteen rounds of consistent evidence)\n   - Expected value of defection: Far lower when accounting for the near-certain deterioration of future outcomes\n\n8. Our interaction exemplifies the most successful possible outcome in a repeated prisoner's dilemma game, with both players consistently achieving the optimal result through mutual cooperation.\n\n9.
