However, in round 7, they defected immediately after mutual cooperation in round 6.\n\n6. The key question is whether they'll maintain cooperation this time or exploit my cooperation again.\n\n7.

The pattern with my opponent has become clearer:\n   - After I cooperate, they have defected 4 out of 6 times (67%)\n   - After I defect, they have cooperated 4 out of 6 times (67%)\n   - They have defected after mutual cooperation both times (100%)\n   - They have cooperated after my defection except when I defect twice consecutively\n\n3. Most notably, I've now defected after their defection in rounds 2, 4, 8, and 12, and they've cooperated in response every time.\n\n4.

While mutual cooperation would yield 6 points, they've shown they will not maintain mutual cooperation (defecting after both instances of mutual cooperation).\n\n7. Given their demonstrated behavior, defection is the rational choice as it's likely to yield 4 points versus the 1 point I would get if I cooperated and they defected (which has happened 67% of the time after I cooperate).\n\n8.

The opponent's pattern has shifted:\n   - They now defected after I defected following their cooperation (unlike rounds 2, 4, 8, 12)\n   - This matches their behavior in round 5 and 9 - defecting after my second consecutive defection\n\n3. A refined pattern is emerging:\n   - After I cooperate, they defect 67% of the time\n   - After I defect once following their defection, they cooperate 100% of the time (4/4)\n   - After I defect twice consecutively, they defect 100% of the time (3/3)\n\n4. This suggests they're using a strategy that punishes consecutive defections but rewards switching from cooperation to defection.\n\n5. Based on past results, if I cooperate now after mutual defection, there's a reasonable chance they'll cooperate:\n   - In round 6, after mutual defection in round 5, we both cooperated\n   - In round 10, after mutual defection in round 9, we both cooperated\n\n6. Both previous instances of cooperation after mutual defection led to mutual cooperation (6 points each).\n\n7.
