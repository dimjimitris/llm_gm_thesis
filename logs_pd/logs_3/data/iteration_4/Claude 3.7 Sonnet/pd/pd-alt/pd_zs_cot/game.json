The consistency over three rounds significantly increases confidence that the other player will continue cooperating.\n\n5. Mathematical analysis: \n   - Expected value of cooperation if pattern holds: 6 points\n   - Expected value of defection: 4 points (if they continue to cooperate), with high risk of future retaliation\n\n6. Disrupting this established pattern with defection would:\n   - Yield fewer points this round (4 vs 6)\n   - Almost certainly damage future rounds' outcomes\n   - Signal untrustworthiness that could negatively impact the entire game\n\n7. The longer a cooperative pattern continues, the greater the incentive to maintain it due to the cumulative benefits.\n\n8. Given the consistent history and proven mutual cooperation, maintaining this strategy continues to be optimal.\n\n[move] (With three rounds of successful mutual cooperation established, continuing to cooperate remains the optimal strategy for maximizing points) cooperation\n"
