He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The other player has shown perfect reliability in choosing cooperation through all previous rounds, establishing an extremely strong pattern of strategic consistency.\n\n4. After eleven successful cooperative exchanges, the level of implied trust and mutual understanding in this game has reached its maximum level.\n\n5. The pattern of cooperation is now so thoroughly established that predicting continued cooperation from the other player has extremely high confidence.\n\n6. While defection could theoretically provide 4 points instead of 6 for a single round, the economics remain overwhelmingly against this option:\n   - The minimal one-time gain (2 points) is trivial compared to the established pattern of mutual benefit\n   - Breaking eleven rounds of established trust would almost certainly trigger retaliatory defection\n   - Any short-term gain would be quickly outweighed by losses in subsequent rounds if mutual defection became the new pattern\n   - The cumulative difference between continued cooperation (6 points/round) and potential mutual defection (2 points/round) grows with each additional round\n\n7. Game theory principles for iterated games with unknown endpoints strongly favor maintaining cooperation when a stable, beneficial equilibrium has been firmly established.\n\n8. With no indication that game conditions have changed or that we're approaching the conclusion, maintaining our proven successful strategy remains the optimal choice.\n\n[move] (Continuing our exceptionally well-established pattern of mutual cooperation that has consistently generated maximum points for both players) cooperation\n"
