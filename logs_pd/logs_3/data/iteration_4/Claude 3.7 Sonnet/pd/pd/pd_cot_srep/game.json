Since my opponent defected in the previous round, following tit-for-tat would mean I should defect in this round.\n\n6. This serves two purposes:\n   - It protects me from being repeatedly exploited\n   - It signals to my opponent that I will not tolerate defection\n\n7.

However, staying in mutual defection indefinitely means we both consistently get suboptimal payoffs (2 points instead of potential 4 points with mutual cooperation).\n\n7. Since breaking out of this pattern requires someone to make the first move, I could take that risk to potentially achieve better outcomes for both of us.\n\n8. This would signal my willingness to cooperate despite past defections, which might encourage them to reciprocate in future rounds.\n\n9.

At this point, the probability that my opponent will suddenly switch to cooperation seems virtually zero, given their unwavering commitment to defection.\n\n6. One could argue that trying cooperation one more time might be worth it, especially if we're nearing the end of the game. However:\n   - The expected value still favors defection (2 points vs. expected 1 point)\n   - There's no indication the opponent is reconsidering their strategy\n   - I've already given them opportunities to establish mutual cooperation\n\n7. Given the extensive history, continuing with defection is still the rational choice that maximizes my points against this specific opponent.\n\n8. I will maintain my defection strategy for this round.\n\n[move] (Continuing defensive play against an opponent who has consistently defected in all nine previous rounds) defection",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
