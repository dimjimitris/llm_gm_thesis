Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma game structure with payoffs for cooperation and defection.\n2. I'm playing against a new player, so I have no history to base my decision on.\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix:\n   - Mutual cooperation: 4 points each\n   - Mutual defection: 2 points each\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1, they get 6\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 6, they get 1\n4. The Nash equilibrium is mutual defection, giving 2 points each.\n5. However, mutual cooperation yields better results (4 points each) than mutual defection.\n6. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I'll establish goodwill by cooperating.\n7. This signals my willingness to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome (4 points each).\n8. If the other player responds with cooperation, we can build trust for future rounds.\n9. If they defect, I can adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

This may indicate they're playing a purely self-interested strategy.\n5. I need to determine whether to:\n   a) Try cooperation again, hoping they'll see the mutual benefit (risk getting 1 point again)\n   b) Match their defection to avoid being exploited (ensuring at least 2 points)\n6. Since my opponent has demonstrated they'll defect when given the opportunity, the rational choice is to defect as well.\n7. By defecting, I can at least secure 2 points (if they defect again) instead of risking only 1 point.\n8. If they switch to cooperation, I would get 6 points, but this seems less likely based on their previous move.\n9.

My opponent has defected in all 11 rounds without exception, showing absolute consistency in their strategy.\n\n4. I've tested cooperation twice (rounds 1 and 4) and was exploited both times, receiving only 1 point per cooperation.\n\n5. When I defect, I consistently receive 2 points against this opponent.\n\n6. After 11 rounds, the evidence is overwhelming that my opponent is committed to an unwavering \"always defect\" strategy.\n\n7. While the Pareto optimal outcome would be mutual cooperation (4 points each), this requires both players to cooperate.\n\n8. Given my opponent's demonstrated behavior across 11 rounds, the probability they would suddenly switch to cooperation is effectively zero.\n\n9. Game theory clearly indicates that against an \"always defect\" opponent, the rational response is to also defect.\n\n10. Defecting ensures I receive 2 points rather than being exploited for 1 point.\n\n11. The optimal decision remains to defect to maximize my score against this opponent.\n\n[move] Defection\n"
