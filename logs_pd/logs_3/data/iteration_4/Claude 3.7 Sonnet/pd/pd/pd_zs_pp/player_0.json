This has led to mutual cooperation and 4 points each time.\n\nHowever, in rounds 7 and 11, when I cooperated a second consecutive time, they defected. This pattern suggests they might defect if I cooperate again now.\n\nGiven this observed pattern, I should anticipate they'll defect if I cooperate again. To avoid being exploited and to maximize my points based on their pattern, I'll defect this round.\n\n[move] (Based on the repeated pattern where my opponent tends to defect after mutual cooperation, I'll defect to avoid being exploited and potentially earn higher points) defection\n"
