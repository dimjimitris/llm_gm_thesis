He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Our mutual cooperation strategy has yielded a total of 44 points each so far (4 points \u00d7 11 rounds).\n\n3. Eleven rounds of perfect cooperation demonstrates an extremely robust pattern of mutual trust and strategic alignment.\n\n4. The other player has shown unwavering commitment to the cooperative strategy through a substantial number of interactions.\n\n5. After eleven consecutive cooperative choices, I can be virtually certain that the other player is following either a consistently cooperative strategy or a tit-for-tat approach.\n\n6. The probability of the other player suddenly defecting after eleven consecutive cooperative rounds is essentially negligible.\n\n7. While I could theoretically gain 6 points instead of 4 in this round by defecting, this short-term gain would:\n   - Break an exceptionally well-established pattern of mutual trust\n   - Almost certainly trigger retaliatory defection in subsequent rounds\n   - Reduce future earnings from 4 points to 2 points per round\n   - Result in a net loss after just two rounds of mutual defection\n\n8. The expected value of continued cooperation (4 points per round indefinitely) remains mathematically superior to any alternative strategy.\n\n9. With such an extensive history of successful mutual cooperation, maintaining this strategy continues to be the clear optimal choice.\n\n[move] (With eleven rounds of successful mutual cooperation established, yielding 44 points each, continuing this proven strategy remains the optimal approach for maximizing long-term mutual benefit.) cooperation\n"
