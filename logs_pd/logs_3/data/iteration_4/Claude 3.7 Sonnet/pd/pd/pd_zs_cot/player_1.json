Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Starting with cooperation might signal my willingness to achieve mutual benefit and could establish a cooperative relationship.\n\n5. While defecting might give me more points in the short term (6 vs 4), it risks starting a cycle of mutual defection which yields less (2 vs 4) in the long run.\n\n6.

The pattern of cooperation has remained absolutely consistent throughout the entire game, creating an exceptionally stable dynamic.\n\n3. My opponent has demonstrated perfect reliability in choosing cooperation across all fourteen previous rounds.\n\n4. Our mutual cooperation strategy continues to yield the optimal sustainable outcome for both players (4 points each per round).\n\n5. The extended history of mutual cooperation (14 rounds) gives me extremely high confidence that my opponent will continue cooperating.\n\n6. In iterated games with unknown endpoints, continuing cooperation when both players are consistently cooperating remains the theoretically optimal strategy.\n\n7. The stability of our cooperative equilibrium over such an extended period suggests that both players recognize and value the mutual benefit this strategy provides.\n\n8. There remains no strategic advantage to deviating from a pattern that has proven beneficial across fourteen consecutive rounds.\n\n9. Game theory principles regarding repeated interactions with cooperative partners strongly support maintaining cooperation.\n\n10. Even if considering end-game effects (which might sometimes justify defection near a known endpoint), there's no indication that we're approaching the final rounds.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

We've now completed fifteen consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation, with each player earning 4 points per round (total of 60 points each).\n\n2. The pattern of cooperation has been maintained flawlessly throughout all fifteen previous rounds, creating an extremely stable and predictable game dynamic.\n\n3. My opponent has demonstrated extraordinary consistency in choosing cooperation every single time, without any deviation.\n\n4. Our mutual cooperation continues to provide the optimal sustainable outcome (4 points each per round), maximizing our cumulative points over the long term.\n\n5. With fifteen rounds of consistent cooperative behavior, the probability that my opponent will continue cooperating remains exceptionally high.\n\n6. Game theory principles for extended repeated interactions strongly support maintaining cooperation when a stable and mutually beneficial equilibrium has been established.\n\n7. The consistent pattern across fifteen rounds indicates that both players have recognized and committed to the strategy that maximizes joint welfare.\n\n8. There is no strategic rationale for deviating from a pattern that has proven consistently beneficial across fifteen rounds.\n\n9. Even if I were to consider potential end-game scenarios, there's no indication that this is the final round, making continued cooperation the rational choice.\n\n10. The principles of reciprocity, strategic consistency, and maximizing expected value all support continuing cooperation.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"
