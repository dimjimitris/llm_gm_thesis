After ten rounds, my opponent has chosen hare with 100% consistency, showing an unwavering commitment to this strategy.\n\n3. I've tested cooperation once by choosing stag in round 5, which was not reciprocated.\n\n4. The expected outcomes remain unchanged:\n   - Choose stag \u2192 Get 1 point (as opponent chooses hare)\n   - Choose hare \u2192 Get 2 points (as opponent chooses hare)\n\n5. With such extensive evidence of my opponent's fixed strategy, there's no rational basis to expect any change in their behavior.\n\n6. The optimal response to an opponent who always chooses hare is to always choose hare myself.\n\n7. While this results in a suboptimal equilibrium (2 points each rather than the potential 4 points from mutual stag play), it maximizes my score given my opponent's behavior.\n\n8. I will continue choosing hare as the strategy that yields the highest expected points against this particular opponent.\n\n[move] (Continuing with the mathematically optimal strategy against an opponent who consistently chooses hare) hare\n"
