The payoff matrix remains:\n   - Both choose stag: We each get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: We each get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n5. After ten rounds of successful cooperation:\n   - The pattern is exceptionally well-established\n   - Both players have demonstrated complete reliability\n   - The mutual understanding appears unambiguous\n\n6. In game theory terms, we've achieved what could be called a \"strong equilibrium\" - a strategy profile that no coalition of players would have incentive to deviate from.\n\n7. The expected value calculation continues to heavily favor cooperation:\n   - Consistent 4 points per round through cooperation\n   - The one-time benefit of defection (2 extra points) becomes increasingly insignificant compared to the potential long-term loss\n   - After ten rounds, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that continued cooperation maximizes returns\n\n8. From a mathematical perspective, even if the game were known to be ending soon, the \"shadow of the future\" has been established strongly enough that cooperation remains rational.\n\n9. Based on all available information and game theory principles, I'll continue with the stag strategy.\n\n[move] (Maintaining our established optimal cooperative equilibrium) stag\n"
