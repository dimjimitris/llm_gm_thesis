Consider the risk-reward trade-offs:\n   - Stag has higher cooperative payoff (4 points) but risk of exploitation (only 1 point)\n   - Hare has lower cooperative payoff (2 points) but higher exploitation potential (6 points)\n\n3. This is a fresh game with a fresh player, so I have no prior information about their strategy.\n\n4. In the absence of communication or prior history, stag is the payoff-maximizing choice IF we both cooperate.\n\n5. However, there's risk in choosing stag. If my opponent chooses hare, I'd only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\n6. Since this is the first round, I'll choose stag to signal cooperative intent, hoping the opponent also values the mutual benefit of 4 points each over potential exploitation.\n\n7.

If I were to switch to hare now, I might gain a short-term advantage (6 points vs. their 1 point), but this would likely prompt them to stop trusting me and switch to hare in future rounds.\n\n5.

Advanced game theory concepts relevant at this stage include:\n   - Convention formation (our cooperation has become a de facto convention)\n   - Strategic inertia (the tendency for established patterns to persist)\n   - Reputation effects (both players have established reliable reputations)\n\n6. The expected value calculation overwhelmingly favors continued cooperation:\n   - The long-term value of maintaining 4 points per round indefinitely\n   - Versus the tiny gain of 2 extra points once, followed by likely deterioration\n\n7. After eleven consistent rounds, the probability of my opponent suddenly deviating is vanishingly small.\n\n8.
