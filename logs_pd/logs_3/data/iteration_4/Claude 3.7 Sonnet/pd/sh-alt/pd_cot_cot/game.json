The comparative analysis continues to favor cooperation:\n   - Our established strategy yields 4 points consistently\n   - The alternative strategies yield lower expected returns given our history\n   - The opportunity cost of breaking cooperation grows with each successful round\n\n8. The psychological commitment to a strategy tends to strengthen with repetition, making it increasingly unlikely either player will deviate after such a long consistent history.\n\n9.

If I were to defect now:\n   - I would gain only 2 additional points this round (6 instead of 4)\n   - My opponent would almost certainly switch to hare in subsequent rounds\n   - This would result in mutual hare choices (2 points each) or continued mismatches\n   - The long-term expected value would significantly decrease\n\n6.
