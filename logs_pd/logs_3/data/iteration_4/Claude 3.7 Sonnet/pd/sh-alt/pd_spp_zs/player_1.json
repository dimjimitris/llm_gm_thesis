You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The optimal outcome would be mutual cooperation (both stag), but there's risk involved since the other player might choose hare to maximize their individual gain.\n\nSince this is the first interaction, I'll opt for cooperation to establish a positive dynamic.\n\n[move] stag\n\nI'm choosing stag to aim for mutual benefit. While there's risk involved if the other player chooses hare, the potential for establishing cooperative play (4 points each) seems worth it compared to the safer but lower return of hare (2 points guaranteed).\n"
