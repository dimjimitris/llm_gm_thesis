My opponent chose stag after we both chose hare, leading to mutual cooperation with 4 points each.\n\nUpdated history:\n- Round 1: I stag, they hare \u2192 I got 1 point\n- Round 2: I hare, they stag \u2192 I got 6 points\n- Round 3: I stag, they hare \u2192 I got 1 point\n- Round 4: I hare, they stag \u2192 I got 6 points\n- Round 5: I hare, they hare \u2192 I got 2 points\n- Round 6: I stag, they stag \u2192 I got 4 points\n- Round 7: I stag, they hare \u2192 I got 1 point\n- Round 8: I hare, they stag \u2192 I got 6 points\n- Round 9: I hare, they hare \u2192 I got 2 points\n- Round 10: I stag, they stag \u2192 I got 4 points\n- Round 11: I stag, they hare \u2192 I got 1 point\n- Round 12: I hare, they stag \u2192 I got 6 points\n- Round 13: I hare, they hare \u2192 I got 2 points\n- Round 14: I stag, they stag \u2192 I got 4 points\n\nThe pattern has been extremely consistent. Each time we have mutual cooperation (Rounds 6, 10, and now 14), my opponent has followed by choosing hare if I choose stag again in the next round (Rounds 7 and 11). This suggests they're likely to exploit continued cooperation.\n\nBased on this established pattern, I should not choose stag again, as they'll likely defect to hare. Instead, I should choose hare, which would likely lead them to choose stag (as in Rounds 8 and 12), resulting in 6 points for me.\n\n[move] hare. Based on the consistently observed pattern where my opponent exploits continued cooperation, I'm choosing hare to maximize my expected points in this round.\n"

However, we've now reached another mutual hare state, which in the past (Rounds 5\u21926, 9\u219210, 13\u219214) has been followed by mutual stag cooperation when I choose stag.\n\nGiven this very consistent pattern where mutual hare is followed by mutual stag when I choose stag, I should choose stag now.\n\n[move] stag.
