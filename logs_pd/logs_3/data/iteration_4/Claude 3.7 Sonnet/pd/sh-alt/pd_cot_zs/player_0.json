Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff matrix for this game:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. This is a classic stag hunt game with a twist. The cooperative outcome (both stag) is mutually beneficial, but risky.\n\n3. If the other player chooses stag, I'm better off choosing hare (6 > 4).\n   If the other player chooses hare, I'm better off choosing hare (2 > 1).\n\n4. Hare is a dominant strategy for me in this single encounter - no matter what the other player does, I do better with hare.\n\n5. However, I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which suggests they might not have established patterns and might go with the cooperative choice.\n\n6. Despite my advantage in choosing hare, if I expect the other player to also reason this way, we'd both choose hare and get 2 points each, which is worse than if we both chose stag (4 points each).\n\n7. Since this might be a repeated game (though not specified), establishing cooperation early could be beneficial.\n\n8. Given this is the first round, I'll choose stag as a signal of willingness to cooperate, hoping the other player makes the same choice.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] stag\n"

Since we both chose stag in the first round, there's an established pattern of cooperation.\n\n4. While I could try to exploit by choosing hare (which would give me 6 points if they stick with stag), this would likely damage trust.\n\n5. If I choose hare and they continue with stag, I would get 6 points now, but the other player might retaliate in future rounds by also choosing hare, leading to just 2 points each in those rounds.\n\n6. Maintaining cooperation (both choosing stag) gives us 4 points each consistently, which is better than the likely outcome of both choosing hare (2 points each).\n\n7. Given that the other player has shown willingness to cooperate, and the long-term benefits of continued cooperation outweigh the short-term gain of defection, I'll continue with stag.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] stag\n"
