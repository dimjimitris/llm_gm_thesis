    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Game Theorist\n2. Strategic Planner\n3. Behavioral Psychologist\n4. AI Assistant (me)\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game with a slight variation in the payoff matrix. Let's analyze the payoffs:\n- Both choose stag: (4, 4)\n- Both choose hare: (2, 2)\n- You choose stag, opponent chooses hare: (1, 6)\n- You choose hare, opponent chooses stag: (6, 1)\n\nWe have two Nash equilibria here: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The stag-stag outcome is Pareto optimal, giving the highest combined payoff, but it's risky if the other player doesn't cooperate.\n\nStrategic Planner: In this first round, we're facing a fresh player with no history of play. We need to consider whether to prioritize maximizing potential gain or minimizing risk. The stag option offers higher mutual benefit but comes with risk. The hare option is safer but suboptimal if both players choose it.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Fresh players often start with cooperative behaviors in games like this. Research suggests that in initial rounds, players tend to choose the option that could lead to mutual benefit if they believe the other player will do the same. However, without established trust, some players might opt for the safer choice.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that this is the first round, I'd recommend choosing stag. This signals a willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit and establishes a positive precedent. If the opponent also chooses stag, we get the optimal outcome (4 points each).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Starting with stag sends a cooperative signal. Even if the opponent chooses hare this round (giving us only 1 point), this information becomes valuable for future rounds. We can adapt our strategy based on their revealed behavior.\n\nStrategic Planner: One consideration is that if our opponent also reasons this way, they might choose stag too, giving us both 4 points. This is better than the 2 points we would each get from both choosing hare.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on your collective analysis, I believe choosing stag offers the best balance of potential reward and strategic positioning for this first round. It signals cooperation, and if the opponent reciprocates, we achieve the optimal outcome.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] I choose stag. Starting with a cooperative approach to achieve mutual benefit.\n"
