The stag choice leads to the highest mutual benefit (4 points each) if we coordinate, but carries risk if they choose hare. Hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) but limits potential mutual gain.\n\nIn general, starting with cooperative behavior can establish a positive precedent.\n\n[move] stag\n"
