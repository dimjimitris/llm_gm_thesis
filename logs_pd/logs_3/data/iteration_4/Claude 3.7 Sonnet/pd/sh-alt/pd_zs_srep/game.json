I chose hare, they chose hare (I got 2 points)\n14. I chose hare, they chose hare (I got 2 points)\n15. I chose hare, they chose hare (I got 2 points)\n\nWith fifteen consecutive rounds showing identical behavior from my opponent, their unwavering commitment to choosing hare is established beyond any reasonable doubt. Against such a deterministic opponent, game theory clearly indicates that my optimal response continues to be choosing hare as well.\n\nThis ensures I receive 2 points per round rather than the 1 point I would receive by choosing stag. While mutual cooperation would be more beneficial overall (4 points each), my opponent has demonstrated complete unwillingness to cooperate throughout our extended interaction.\n\n[move] hare - Continuing with the optimal strategy against an opponent who has consistently chosen hare in all fifteen previous rounds without any variation.\n"
