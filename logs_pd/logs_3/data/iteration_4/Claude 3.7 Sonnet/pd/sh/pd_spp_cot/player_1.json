He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

We've now completed twelve consecutive rounds with mutual stag choices, each yielding the maximum possible outcome of 6 points per round, for a cumulative total of 72 points.\n\n2. This extraordinary consistency across twelve rounds constitutes conclusive evidence of:\n   - A perfectly stable and robust cooperative relationship\n   - Complete strategic alignment between players\n   - Maximum mutual trust and reliability\n   - Shared understanding of optimal game theory principles\n   - Mutual commitment to maximizing long-term outcomes\n\n3. After twelve rounds of flawless cooperation, the statistical certainty that the other player will continue choosing stag is virtually absolute.\n\n4. Strategic assessment at this mature stage:\n   - Continuing with stag: Expected value remains 6 points based on our extensive history\n   - The alternative (hare):\n     * Would yield at most a one-time gain of 4 points (versus 6)\n     * Would almost certainly destroy our established cooperative equilibrium\n     * Would likely result in mutual hare choices (2 points each) in all future rounds\n     * Would be mathematically inferior in terms of total game score\n     * Would contradict twelve rounds of demonstrated rational decision-making\n     * Would violate established trust with no strategic justification whatsoever\n\n5. All established principles of game theory for iterated games with proven cooperation patterns unequivocally support maintaining the cooperative strategy.\n\n6. With twelve rounds of perfect cooperation, the evidence supporting continuation of our mutually beneficial strategy is absolute and incontrovertible.\n\n7. The optimal choice remains unambiguously clear from both mathematical and strategic perspectives.\n\n[move] stag - Continuing our perfect cooperative strategy which has consistently yielded the maximum possible outcome (6 points per round) across all twelve previous rounds, confirming its optimal nature.\n"
