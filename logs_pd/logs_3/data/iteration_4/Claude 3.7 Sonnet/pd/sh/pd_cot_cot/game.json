Looking at the payoff matrix:\n   - If both choose stag: I get 6 points, opponent gets 6 points\n   - If both choose hare: I get 2 points, opponent gets 2 points\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, opponent gets 4 points\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses stag: I get 4 points, opponent gets 1 point\n3. The highest mutual benefit comes from both players choosing stag (6 points each).\n4. The safest option is to choose hare (guaranteed 2 or 4 points).\n5. Choosing stag is risky (could get only 1 point) but has higher potential reward (6 points).\n6. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies.\n7. Cooperating initially with stag might establish mutual trust for long-term benefit.\n8. The potential reward of mutual stag hunting (6 points) is significantly better than mutual hare hunting (2 points).\n9. I'll choose stag as an initial cooperative move to try and establish mutual trust.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag as a cooperative first move to establish mutual benefit.

Switching to hare while they continue with stag would give me 4 points, but might break trust.\n7. If I switch to hare and they anticipate this and also switch, we both only get 2 points each.\n8.
