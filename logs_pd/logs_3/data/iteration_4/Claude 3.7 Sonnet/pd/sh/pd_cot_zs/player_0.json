He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This is a classic stag hunt game where cooperation (both choosing stag) yields the highest mutual benefit.\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, there's no history to base my decision on.\n\n4. The stag option has the potential for the highest payoff (6 points) if we both cooperate.\n\n5. However, if I choose stag and the opponent chooses hare, I get the worst outcome (1 point).\n\n6. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, and possibly 4 if the opponent chooses stag.\n\n7. Since this is the first interaction, I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n8. Cooperation (both choosing stag) is Pareto optimal - we both get the maximum possible points.\n\n9. I'll take the risk of choosing stag, hoping to establish a cooperative relationship from the start.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] stag\n"
