This is a classic Stag Hunt game with the following payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: We each get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: We each get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, they choose hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 points\n   - I choose hare, they choose stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. The stag-stag outcome (6,6) is Pareto optimal - it gives the highest possible reward to both players.\n\n3. However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n\n4. Choosing hare guarantees me at least 2 points, and possibly 4 points.\n\n5. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n6. The rational choice would be to coordinate on stag, but without communication, there's risk.\n\n7. I'll choose stag, betting on cooperation and mutual benefit. This signals my willingness to cooperate for the best joint outcome.\n\n8. If my opponent is rational and understands the game theory, they should also choose stag.\n\n[move] stag"

Since my opponent chose hare last time, they might:\n   - Continue with hare since it worked well for them (giving me 2 points if I choose hare)\n   - Switch to stag thinking I might switch to hare (giving me 4 points if I choose hare)\n   - Switch to stag hoping for mutual cooperation (giving me 6 points if I choose stag)\n\n6.

This could mean:\n   - They've changed their strategy\n   - Their pattern is more complex than I thought\n   - They're trying to confuse me\n\n5. Let me reconsider the possible pattern:\n   - Looking at recent rounds (7-11): stag \u2192 hare \u2192 stag \u2192 hare \u2192 hare\n   - Maybe they're now using a different alternating pattern\n\n6. Given this disruption to the pattern, I need to make a new prediction.\n   - If they're now alternating between one hare and one stag, they would choose stag next\n   - If they've switched to always choosing hare, they would choose hare next\n\n7. My performance statistics remain:\n   - Choosing hare: 26 points (9 rounds), average 2.89 points\n   - Choosing stag: 2 points (2 rounds), average 1 point\n\n8. Given the uncertainty about their new pattern, choosing hare remains the safer option:\n   - If they choose stag, I get 4 points\n   - If they choose hare, I get 2 points\n   This is better than choosing stag where I risk getting only 1 point if they choose hare.\n\n9. I'll continue with hare while I gather more information about their possible new pattern.\n\n[move] hare"

While choosing stag could potentially yield 6 points if they follow their pattern and choose stag, choosing hare has been consistently more profitable for me given their behavior.\n\n8. Since their pattern has been so consistent, and choosing hare against their stag has reliably yielded me 4 points, I'll continue with the hare strategy.\n\n9. This is a calculated choice - while I could try for mutual cooperation (stag-stag), the consistent pattern suggests I can reliably get 4 points by choosing hare when they choose stag.\n\n[move] hare",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
