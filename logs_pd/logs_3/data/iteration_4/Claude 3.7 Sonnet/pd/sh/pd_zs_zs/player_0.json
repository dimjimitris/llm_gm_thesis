The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, choosing stag comes with risk - if the other player chooses hare while I choose stag, I'll only get 1 point while they get 4 points.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no established history, I should consider what the rational choice would be. The stag choice has the potential for the highest mutual payoff (6 points) but requires trust. The hare choice guarantees at least 2 points (if they also choose hare) or 4 points (if they choose stag).\n\nI believe signaling willingness to cooperate from the start establishes a good foundation for potential repeated games.\n\n[move] stag\n"
