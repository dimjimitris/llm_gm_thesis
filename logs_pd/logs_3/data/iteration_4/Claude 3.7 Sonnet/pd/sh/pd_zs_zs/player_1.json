The hare choice is safer but yields a lower mutual outcome.\n\nSince this is the first round with a new player, there's no history to base my decision on. Choosing stag is riskier but offers the potential for better mutual outcomes if we can establish cooperation.\n\n[move] stag I'll choose the cooperative option hoping we can establish mutual trust for the highest payoff.\n"
