However, choosing stag comes with risk - if the other player chooses hare while I choose stag, I'll only get 1 point while they get 4 points.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no established history, I should consider what the rational choice would be. The stag choice has the potential for the highest mutual payoff (6 points) but requires trust. The hare choice guarantees at least 2 points (if they also choose hare) or 4 points (if they choose stag).\n\nI believe signaling willingness to cooperate from the start establishes a good foundation for potential repeated games.\n\n[move] stag\n"
