We've had many consecutive rounds of both choosing hare, establishing a stable equilibrium that consistently yields 2 points per round for me.\n\nThe pattern is abundantly clear at this point. While the cooperative stag-stag outcome would theoretically yield higher rewards (6 points each), my opponent has shown no inclination toward this strategy despite multiple opportunities. My attempts to choose stag resulted in lower payoffs (1 point each time).\n\n[move] hare Continuing with the optimal strategy against this opponent based on their demonstrated consistent behavior across many rounds.\n"
