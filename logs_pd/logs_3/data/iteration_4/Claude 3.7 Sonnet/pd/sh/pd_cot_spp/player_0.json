He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: We each get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: We each get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, opponent gets 4 points\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4 points, opponent gets 1 point\n\n2. This is a classic \"stag hunt\" coordination game with risk-reward tradeoffs.\n\n3. The highest mutual benefit comes from both choosing stag (6 points each).\n\n4. However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n\n5. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points (if they choose hare too) and possibly 4 points (if they choose stag).\n\n6. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, there's no prior history to inform my decision.\n\n7. In this situation, I should consider that the optimal outcome for both of us would be mutual cooperation (both choosing stag).\n\n8. Since this is a repeated game (multiple rounds), starting with stag signals my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n9. The potential reward of mutual stag (6 points) significantly outweighs the safer but lower payoff of mutual hare (2 points).\n\n10. I'll choose stag, hoping to establish cooperative behavior from the beginning.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing stag to aim for mutual cooperation and maximum points for both players.\n"
