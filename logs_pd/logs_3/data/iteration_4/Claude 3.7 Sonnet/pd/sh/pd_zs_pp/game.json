I chose hare, they chose hare (I got 2)\n\nThis breaks the pattern I expected (where they might choose stag after cooperation+hare). However, it aligns with another pattern: after mutual hare choices (rounds 5, 9, 13), I've chosen stag and achieved cooperation (rounds 6, 10, 14).\n\nBased on this recurring pattern, choosing stag after mutual hare has consistently led to cooperation. I'll try stag again to see if we can reestablish the cooperative equilibrium.\n\n[move] stag Choosing stag based on the observed pattern that mutual cooperation follows mutual hare choices.\n"
