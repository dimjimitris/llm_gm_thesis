Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I'll reason through the possibilities:\n\n- Mutual cooperation (6,6) gives the highest joint payoff\n- While defecting against a cooperator gives higher individual payoff (4,1), it risks establishing distrust\n- Starting with cooperation signals willingness to achieve mutual benefit\n- Even if the other player defects, the downside (1 point) is manageable\n\nGiven this is the first interaction, I believe setting a cooperative tone is the better long-term strategy.\n\n[move] cooperation I choose to cooperate to establish mutual trust and aim for optimal joint outcomes.\n"
