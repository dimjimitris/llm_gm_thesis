You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since this is the first move against a new player, I'll reason through the payoff matrix:\n\n- Mutual cooperation (6,6) gives the highest combined payoff and a good individual payoff\n- The temptation to defect when the other cooperates (4,1) gives a higher individual payoff but hurts overall\n- Mutual defection (2,2) is the worst combined outcome\n- Being cooperated on while defecting (1,4) is the worst individual outcome\n\nFor a first move, I believe establishing a cooperative precedent is beneficial. It signals willingness to work together for mutual benefit, and even if the other player defects, the loss isn't catastrophic.\n\n[move] cooperate\n"
