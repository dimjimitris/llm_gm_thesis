However, there's always the temptation to defect since it can yield 4 points if the other player cooperates.\n\nSince this is the first move and we're starting fresh, I think it's best to start with a cooperative approach. This can help establish mutual trust and potentially lead to sustained cooperation, which would yield the highest long-term payoff.\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to start with cooperation to potentially establish mutual trust and aim for the optimal outcome.\n"
