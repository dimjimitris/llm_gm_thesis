    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Game Theorist - For analyzing game strategy and payoff matrices\n2. Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding player psychology and decision patterns\n3. Strategic Advisor - For overall strategy planning\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. This is a classic prisoner's dilemma scenario:\n- Mutual cooperation: 4,4\n- Mutual defection: 2,2\n- Unilateral defection: 6,1 (for defector)\n- Unilateral cooperation: 1,6 (for cooperator)\nFrom a pure game theory perspective, defection is the Nash equilibrium.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: However, this is the first move against a fresh player. First impressions matter, and starting with cooperation can establish goodwill and potentially lead to mutual cooperation in future interactions. Research shows that cooperative first moves often encourage reciprocity.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with the Behavioral Psychologist. While defection might seem tempting for a higher immediate payoff, cooperation could be more beneficial here because:\n1. It signals positive intent\n2. It could establish a pattern of mutual cooperation\n3. The difference between mutual cooperation (4) and mutual defection (2) is significant in the long run\n\nGame Theorist: One concern though - if the opponent defects, we'll only get 1 point while they get 6. Are we willing to take that risk?\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: In a first interaction, many players tend to choose cooperation as well. The potential benefit of establishing mutual cooperation (4 points consistently) outweighs the risk of one-time exploitation.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's go with cooperation. It's a strategic investment in potential future cooperation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate as a gesture of goodwill and to encourage mutual cooperation.\n"

This suggests our opponent is also willing to engage in mutually beneficial cooperation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The successful mutual cooperation in the first round has established a positive precedent. Players tend to stick with successful strategies, especially when they lead to optimal outcomes for both parties.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree. Our opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior, and there's no reason to deviate from a strategy that's working. Switching to defection now would:\n1. Break the trust we've built\n2. Potentially trigger retaliatory defection\n3. Reduce our long-term point accumulation potential\n\nGame Theorist: The math supports this. Continued mutual cooperation (4 points each) is better than trying to exploit for one round (6 points) and likely facing retaliation afterwards (2 points or less in subsequent rounds).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Yes, maintaining the cooperative relationship we've established is the optimal strategy here.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's maintain cooperation to reinforce the mutually beneficial relationship.\n\n[move] (Maintaining successful mutual cooperation strategy from previous round) cooperation\n"
