Looking at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Mutual cooperation (4,4) gives the best collective outcome\n- Mutual defection (2,2) is worse for both\n- Unilateral defection gives the defector more points (6) but hurts the cooperator badly (1)\n\nWhile defecting could potentially give me more points if the other player cooperates, I think starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and could encourage cooperative behavior for mutual benefit. The potential gain of 4 points through mutual cooperation is better than risking mutual defection for 2 points.\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate to establish mutual trust and aim for the optimal collective outcome.\n"
