Strong pattern emergence:\n   * After mutual hare rounds, opponent often switches to stag\n   * They seem to periodically attempt to break out of the low-scoring cycle\n   * This has happened consistently throughout the game\n   * Opponent appears to be following this strategy without adaptation\n\n3. Statistical prediction:\n   * Based on past rounds, high probability opponent will play stag\n   * They've shown this behavior after mutual hare repeatedly\n   * Their strategy seems algorithmic rather than adaptive\n   * No indication they're changing their approach\n\n4. Risk/reward calculation:\n   * If opponent follows pattern (plays stag): I get 4 points with hare\n   * If opponent deviates (plays hare): I get 2 points with hare\n   * No downside to playing hare - minimum 2 points\n   * Maximum risk protection with potential upside\n\n5. Decision:\n   * Stay with hare\n   * Reasoning:\n     - Strong historical pattern suggests opponent will play stag\n     - Potential for 4 points with no risk of getting only 1\n     - Strategy has been consistently successful\n     - No rational reason to deviate from working approach\n     - Maintain exploitation of opponent's predictable pattern\n\n[move] hare\n"

Opponent's established cycle:\n   * They just got exploited again (1 point) with stag\n   * They have NEVER maintained stag after being exploited\n   * They consistently switch to hare after getting 1 point\n   * This reaction has been 100% reliable\n\n3. Game state analysis:\n   * We're in a stable cycle where:\n     - After being exploited, opponent plays hare\n     - After mutual hare, opponent tries stag\n     - This cycle has repeated multiple times\n     - No deviation from this pattern observed\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   * Playing stag would go against proven pattern\n   * Opponent is virtually certain to play hare\n   * No strategic reason to risk getting 1 point\n   * Current strategy is optimal given opponent's behavior\n\n5. Decision:\n   * Stay with hare\n   * Reasoning:\n     - Opponent will almost certainly play hare after being exploited\n     - Secure 2 points from mutual hare\n     - Strategy has been consistently successful\n     - No reason to deviate from working pattern\n     - Maintain safe, predictable outcome\n\n[move] hare\n"

Historical pattern analysis:\n   * After EVERY mutual hare round:\n     - Opponent has switched to stag\n     - This has happened in rounds 8, 10, 12, and 14\n     - No exceptions to this pattern\n   * Current situation matches these previous cases exactly\n\n3.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
