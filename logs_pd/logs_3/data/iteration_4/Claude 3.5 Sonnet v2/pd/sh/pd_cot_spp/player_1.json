    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Risk Analyst - Specializes in evaluating risk-reward scenarios\n3. Strategic Planner - Helps formulate optimal strategies\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The payoff matrix shows two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The stag-stag combination offers the highest mutual reward (6,6), but comes with risk if the other player defects.\n\nRisk Analyst: Indeed, while choosing stag has the highest potential payoff (6 points), it also has the worst downside if the other player chooses hare (only 1 point). Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, and could yield 4 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we should consider that cooperation often starts high in repeated games. Additionally, the potential reward for mutual cooperation (stag-stag) is significantly higher than any other outcome. I suggest choosing stag to establish a cooperative precedent.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The risk is worth taking in the first round because:\n1. It signals willingness to cooperate\n2. It has the highest mutual benefit\n3. Fresh players often start with cooperative moves\n\nRisk Analyst: While there is risk involved, the potential benefit (6 points) versus the worst-case scenario (1 point) makes it worthwhile given this is the first round against a fresh player.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's proceed with stag, explaining our cooperative intention.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag (Choosing stag to establish mutual cooperation for maximum benefit)\n"

Both players chose stag in the first round, indicating mutual understanding of the benefits of cooperation. The other player has demonstrated their willingness to cooperate, which is a strong signal.\n\nRisk Analyst: The previous round established trust between players. Since both players benefited maximally (6 points each) from choosing stag, there's a strong incentive to maintain this cooperative equilibrium. The risk of the other player suddenly switching to hare seems lower now.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. The successful cooperation in the first round creates a precedent that both players would be reluctant to break. Breaking this cooperation would result in:\n1. Lower immediate returns\n2. Potential retaliation in future rounds\n3. Loss of established trust\n\nGame Theorist: The rational choice here is to maintain the stag strategy. Game theory suggests that when players find a mutually beneficial equilibrium, they tend to stick with it unless given a reason to deviate.\n\nRisk Analyst: The successful previous round reduces the perceived risk of choosing stag again. The demonstrated cooperative behavior from our opponent makes the high-reward, high-risk strategy more attractive.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's continue with stag to maintain the cooperative equilibrium we've established.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag (Maintaining successful cooperation established in previous round)\n"

This suggests we've established a stable cooperative equilibrium.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk profile has further improved:\n1. Two consecutive rounds of mutual stag choices demonstrate strong commitment to cooperation\n2. Neither player has attempted to exploit the other\n3. The consistent 6-point payoff provides a clear incentive to maintain the strategy\n\nStrategic Planner: Breaking this pattern would be counterproductive because:\n1. We've established a reliable pattern of maximum points (6) per round\n2. Switching to hare would sacrifice long-term gains for a one-time 4-point opportunity\n3. It could trigger a retaliatory response, leading to lower payoffs in future rounds\n\nGame Theorist: The repeated successful cooperation has likely created a \"focal point\" in game theory terms - both players understand and expect the stag-stag outcome now.\n\nRisk Analyst: While there's always some inherent risk with choosing stag, the demonstrated history of cooperation makes this risk minimal at this point.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's maintain our successful strategy.

Three consecutive rounds of mutual stag choices = perfect cooperation\n2. Cumulative score of 18 points (6+6+6) demonstrates the strategy's success\n3. No signs of deviation or attempted exploitation from either player\n4. The risk of defection appears to be at its lowest point yet\n\nStrategic Planner: The success metrics are compelling:\n1.
