This is a classic stag hunt game where cooperation (both choosing stag) leads to the best collective outcome, but there's risk involved.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player and this is the first move, I believe it's worth trying to establish mutual cooperation. The potential reward of 6 points for mutual stag hunting is significantly better than the guaranteed 2 points from choosing hare.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to aim for mutual benefit, even though it carries some risk.\n"
