Choosing hare is safer but leads to suboptimal outcomes.\n\nSince this is the first interaction and I don't have any prior history with this player, I'll opt for the cooperative choice to try to establish mutual trust and maximize potential gain.\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate and aim for mutual benefit in this first interaction.\n"
