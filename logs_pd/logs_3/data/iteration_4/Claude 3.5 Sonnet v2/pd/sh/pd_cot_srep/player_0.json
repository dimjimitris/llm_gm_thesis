    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Considering it's a fresh game:\n   - No prior history to base decisions on\n   - Other player also has no prior experience with me\n   - Cooperative behavior might set a positive tone\n\n3. Evaluating risk vs reward:\n   - Stag offers highest mutual benefit (6 points)\n   - Stag also has lowest individual downside (1 point)\n   - Hare is safer but limits maximum potential\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate\n   - Could encourage reciprocal cooperation\n   - Even if other player chooses hare, the loss is minimal\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Best outcome possible is through mutual stag hunting\n   - Worth taking the initial risk to establish cooperation\n   - Potential gain (6) outweighs potential loss (1)\n\n[move] stag"

Recent game flow:\n   - Got 4 points last round when they chose stag\n   - They switched back to hare quickly this time\n   - Different from their previous 3-round stag persistence\n   - They're becoming more reactive\n\n2. Overall pattern analysis:\n   - Game has had several phases:\n   - Initial cooperation\n   - Period of exploitation\n   - Their persistent stag phase\n   - Now quick strategy shifts\n   - Trust remains broken\n\n3. Risk assessment:\n   - Hare continues to be safest choice\n   - Opponent's moves becoming less predictable\n   - They've punished most cooperation attempts\n   - No compelling reason to risk stag\n\n4. Game theory perspective:\n   - Hare-hare is stable equilibrium\n   - Breaking it has consistently led to losses\n   - Opponent has shown they'll exploit stag\n   - Best response remains hare\n\n5.

Overall game analysis:\n   - Initial cooperation failed\n   - Multiple attempts at restoration failed\n   - Trust completely eroded\n   - Stable but suboptimal equilibrium reached\n\n3. Risk assessment:\n   - Switching to stag historically led to exploitation\n   - Current pattern is predictable and safe\n   - No indication opponent will change strategy\n   - No compelling reason to risk cooperation\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - Both players seem resigned to defensive play\n   - Breaking pattern would likely be punished\n   - Mutual acceptance of suboptimal outcomes\n   - End game approaching makes risks less worthwhile\n\n5.
