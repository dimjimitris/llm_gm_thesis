Key considerations:\n   - Choosing stag has highest potential reward (6)\n   - But stag is risky - if other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n   - Hare is safer - guarantees at least 2 points, possible 4 points\n\n4. Since this is a fresh start:\n   - No prior history to base decisions on\n   - Other player is also facing same dilemma\n   - Mutual cooperation (stag) would be ideal\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate\n   - This enables possibility of best outcome (6 points)\n   - Risk is worth potential reward in first round\n   - Sets positive cooperative precedent\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to aim for mutual benefit through cooperation\n"

Current pattern analysis:\n   - Two consecutive rounds of successful cooperation\n   - Both players maintaining optimal strategy\n   - Mutual trust has been established\n   - We've achieved stable beneficial equilibrium\n\n3. Game theory perspective:\n   - We're in the optimal Nash equilibrium\n   - Both players receiving maximum possible points\n   - No incentive for either player to deviate\n   - Cooperation is self-reinforcing\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Breaking cooperation would be irrational\n   - Both players demonstrating commitment to cooperation\n   - Past volatility seems resolved\n   - Trust has been proven through repeated cooperation\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Continue with stag strategy\n   - Maintain proven cooperative equilibrium\n   - No strategic benefit to deviating\n   - Maximize points through continued mutual trust\n   - Recent history strongly supports this choice\n\n[move] stag Maintaining successful cooperative equilibrium\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent broke established cooperation\n   - They exploited trust after two rounds of cooperation\n   - Similar to their behavior in early game\n   - Shows they're willing to break trust for short-term gain\n\n3. Trust assessment:\n   - Cooperation was temporary\n   - Opponent's pattern of exploitation has resumed\n   - They may be using alternating strategy\n   - Trust has been broken again\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   - Continuing stag is highly risky\n   - Opponent has shown willingness to exploit\n   - Need to protect against further exploitation\n   - Previous success with hare strategy is relevant\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Switch back to defensive hare strategy\n   - Protect against further exploitation\n   - If they choose stag (trying to restore cooperation), get 4 points\n   - If they choose hare, still get 2 points\n   - Better than risking another 1-point outcome\n\n[move] hare Reverting to defensive strategy after trust breach\n"

Pattern recognition:\n   - This pattern is very familiar from earlier rounds\n   - Opponent alternates between exploitation and stag\n   - When I play stag, they exploit\n   - When I play hare, they play stag\n\n3. Strategy effectiveness:\n   - Hare strategy has consistently yielded 4 points against their stag\n   - Attempting cooperation has led to exploitation\n   - Brief cooperation period (Rounds 12-13) was exception, not new rule\n   - Defensive hare strategy remains most profitable\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Opponent's return to stag might be attempting to lure cooperation\n   - Previous pattern suggests they'll exploit if I choose stag\n   - Hare strategy provides consistent good returns\n   - No compelling reason to risk cooperation\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Continue with hare strategy\n   - Protect against exploitation\n   - Maintain reliable 4-point outcomes\n   - Opponent's behavior pattern remains exploitable\n   - Don't fall for temporary cooperation bait\n\n[move] hare Maintaining defensive strategy against predictable opponent pattern\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
