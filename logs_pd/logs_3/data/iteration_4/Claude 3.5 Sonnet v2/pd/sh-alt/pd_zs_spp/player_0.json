Given that I'm playing against a fresh player, this is an interesting variant of the stag hunt game where cooperation (stag) gives the best mutual outcome, but also carries risk.\n\nThe optimal outcome would be if both players choose stag (4 points each), but if I choose stag and they choose hare, I'll only get 1 point while they get 6. Choosing hare is safer since it guarantees at least 2 points, with a potential for 6 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\nHowever, since this is the first move and we have no prior history, I think it's worth trying to establish a cooperative pattern. I'll choose stag to signal my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing stag to attempt establishing mutual cooperation for optimal outcomes.\n"
