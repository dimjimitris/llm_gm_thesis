While choosing hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points), choosing stag has the potential for the best mutual outcome.\n\nAs this is the first move with a new player, I want to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. Therefore:\n\n[move] stag (Choosing stag to aim for mutual cooperation and best joint outcome)\n"
