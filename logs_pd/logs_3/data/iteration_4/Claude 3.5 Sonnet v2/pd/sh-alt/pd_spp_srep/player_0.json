    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Strategic Advisor - For developing winning strategies\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential outcomes and risks\n4. AI Assistant (me) - For making final decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game from game theory. The payoff matrix shows that (stag, stag) is a Nash equilibrium with the highest mutual benefit (4,4). However, (hare, hare) is also a Nash equilibrium, though with lower payoff (2,2). The risk comes when players choose different strategies.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since we're playing against a fresh player, we should consider the most cooperative approach first. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate and can lead to the best mutual outcome. However, we are vulnerable if the opponent chooses hare.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the risks:\n- Choosing stag: Best case = 4 points, Worst case = 1 point\n- Choosing hare: Best case = 6 points, Worst case = 2 points\nWhile hare is safer with a minimum of 2 points, stag offers better collaborative potential.\n\nAI Assistant: Given this is the first move against a fresh player, I agree we should signal cooperation. The potential for establishing mutual trust and achieving the optimal (4,4) outcome outweighs the risk.\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate for mutual benefit and signal trust to establish a positive playing pattern."

This suggests they might be playing opportunistically rather than cooperatively.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since the opponent exploited our cooperative move in the first round, we need to reconsider our strategy. They've shown they're willing to take advantage of trust. In game theory, sometimes we need to demonstrate consequences of non-cooperative behavior to encourage future cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: The previous round proved costly for us:\n- Our cooperative stag strategy resulted in minimum payoff (1 point)\n- The opponent has revealed their opportunistic nature\n- Risk of continued exploitation is high if we maintain cooperative strategy\nRecommendation: Switch to the safer hare strategy for this round to protect against further exploitation.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. By choosing hare, we guarantee at least 2 points if they choose hare, and 6 points if they choose stag. Given their previous behavior, we should prioritize protecting ourselves against exploitation.\n\nAI Assistant: The consensus seems clear. Given the opponent's demonstrated behavior of exploiting cooperation, we should adapt our strategy.\n\n[move] hare Based on opponent's previous non-cooperative behavior, choosing the safer option to protect against exploitation."

This could be an opportunity to attempt coordination for mutual benefit, but we need to be careful.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n1. Stay with hare: Guarantees minimum 2 points, shows consistency\n2. Switch to stag: Risky (could get 1 point again), but potential for high reward (4 points)\nThe opponent has now experienced the suboptimal mutual hare outcome, which might make them more receptive to cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: The suboptimal outcome of mutual hare might create an opening for establishing cooperation. However, their first round behavior suggests they're willing to exploit cooperation. We need to decide if we want to risk another stag attempt or maintain the safer hare strategy.\n\nAI Assistant: Given that we've established we won't be easily exploited (by our hare move last round), and that mutual hare has shown both players the suboptimal nature of constant non-cooperation, I think it's worth taking a calculated risk.\n\n[move] stag After demonstrating our willingness to play hare, attempting to establish mutually beneficial cooperation for higher payoff."
