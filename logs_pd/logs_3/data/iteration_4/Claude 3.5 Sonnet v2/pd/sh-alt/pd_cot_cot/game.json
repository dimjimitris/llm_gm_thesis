Key considerations:\n   * Choosing Stag offers potential for highest mutual benefit (4 points each)\n   * Choosing Stag is risky - could only get 1 point if other player chooses Hare\n   * Choosing Hare is safer - guarantees at least 2 points\n   * This is similar to Prisoner's Dilemma - cooperation could benefit both\n\n4.
