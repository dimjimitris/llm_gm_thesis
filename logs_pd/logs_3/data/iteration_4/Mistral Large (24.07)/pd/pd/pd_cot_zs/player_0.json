    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix**:\n    - Cooperate + Cooperate: Both get 4 points.\n    - Defect + Defect: Both get 2 points.\n    - Cooperate + Defect: You get 1 point, opponent gets 6 points.\n    - Defect + Cooperate: You get 6 points, opponent gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Analyze Potential Gains and Losses**:\n    - Cooperating when the opponent defects results in the lowest point gain (1 point).\n    - Defecting when the opponent cooperates results in the highest point gain (6 points).\n    - Mutual cooperation or defection provides a balanced outcome (4 points or 2 points respectively).\n\n3. **Consider the Strategy of the Opponent**:\n    - Fresh players might tend to cooperate initially, especially if they are inexperienced.\n    - Since I am playing against a fresh player, they might be more inclined to cooperate.\n\n4. **Choose the Optimal Move**:\n    - Given the potential for the opponent to cooperate, defecting would maximize my points if the opponent cooperates (6 points).\n    - However, continuous defection can lead to mutual defection in subsequent rounds, yielding low scores (2 points each).\n\n5. **Make the Move**:\n    - Initially, I could cooperate to establish a baseline of trust.\n    - If the opponent reciprocates with cooperation, we can both maximize our points through cooperation over the long term.\n    - If the opponent defects, I can adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\n**Final Decision**:\n[move] For this round, I choose cooperation to establish trust and evaluate the opponent's move.\n\nCooperate\n"
