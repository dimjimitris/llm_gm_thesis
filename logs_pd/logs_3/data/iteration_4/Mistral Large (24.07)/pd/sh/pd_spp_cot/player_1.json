    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "Sure, let's begin by breaking down the steps to make an informed decision.\n\n### Steps to Determine Move\n\n1. **Understanding the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - If both choose **stag**: Both get 6 points.\n   - If both choose **hare**: Both get 2 points.\n   - If you choose **stag** and other chooses **hare**: You get 1 point, other gets 4 points.\n   - If you choose **hare** and other chooses **stag**: You get 4 points, other gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Initial Strategy**:\n   - Choosing **stag** is riskier but has a higher reward if the other player also chooses **stag**.\n   - Choosing **hare** is safer but has a lower reward if the other player also chooses **hare**.\n   - If the other player chooses **hare** and you choose **stag**, you get 1 point, which is the lowest possible score.\n\n3. **Considering the Opponent**:\n   - Since the other player is fresh, they might not have a well-defined strategy and could make a random choice.\n   - Assuming the other player is also trying to maximize points, they might also consider the higher payoff of **stag**.\n\n4. **Balancing Risk and Reward**:\n   - Choosing **hare** ensures a moderate payoff regardless of the other player's choice.\n   - Choosing **stag** could result in the highest or lowest payoff depending on the other player's choice.\n\n5. **First Move Decision**:\n   - Given the uncertainty, a balanced approach would be to start with **hare** to assess the opponent\u2019s strategy.\n   - This provides a moderate reward and avoids the risk of getting the lowest score.\n\n### Final Decision:\nBased on the above reasoning, I will choose **hare** for the first move to gather information and minimize risk.\n\n### Move:\n[move] For the first move, I choose hare to assess the opponent's strategy and minimize risk.\n\nLet's proceed with the move and see how the opponent responds. This will inform our strategy for the subsequent rounds.\n"
