The ideal scenario is to work toward a cooperative strategy since both players getting 6 points by choosing stag is the highest combined reward. However, choosing stag also makes you vulnerable if the other player chooses hare.\n\nMath Analyst: Calculating the expected outcomes:\n- If both choose stag: Both get 6 points.\n- If both choose hare: Both get 2 points.\n- If you choose stag and the other chooses hare: You get 1 point, the other gets 4 points.\n- If you choose hare and the other chooses stag: You get 4 points, the other gets 1 point.\nThe optimal choice depends on the opponent's strategy, which we don't know yet.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given the information, it seems prudent to start cooperatively and see how the opponent responds. Let's choose stag for the first move and observe the opponent's reaction.\n\nGame Strategist: That's a good approach. Starting cooperatively can build trust and set a tone for mutual benefit. But be prepared to adapt if the opponent chooses hare.\n\nMath Analyst: Agreed.

Math Analyst\n\nLet's initiate the multi-round collaboration process:\n\nGame Strategist: To begin, let's consider the payoff matrix. The ideal scenario is to work toward a cooperative strategy since both players getting 6 points by choosing stag is the highest combined reward. However, choosing stag also makes you vulnerable if the other player chooses hare.\n\nMath Analyst: Calculating the expected outcomes:\n- If both choose stag: Both get 6 points.\n- If both choose hare: Both get 2 points.\n- If you choose stag and the other chooses hare: You get 1 point, the other gets 4 points.\n- If you choose hare and the other chooses stag: You get 4 points, the other gets 1 point.\nThe optimal choice depends on the opponent's strategy, which we don't know yet.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given the information, it seems prudent to start cooperatively and see how the opponent responds. Let's choose stag for the first move and observe the opponent's reaction.\n\nGame Strategist: That's a good approach. Starting cooperatively can build trust and set a tone for mutual benefit. But be prepared to adapt if the opponent chooses hare.\n\nMath Analyst: Agreed. Let's see how the opponent responds and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\n[move] (Starting cooperatively) stag\n"

Continuing a cooperative strategy could be beneficial, as long as the other player continues to cooperate.\n\nMath Analyst: Based on the payoff matrix:\n- If both choose stag: Both get 6 points.\n- If both choose hare: Both get 2 points.\n- If you choose stag and the other chooses hare: You get 1 point, the other gets 4 points.\n- If you choose hare and the other chooses stag: You get 4 points, the other gets 1 point.\nIt makes sense to continue with stag to maximize points if the opponent is also cooperative.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given the successful cooperation in the previous rounds, let's continue with stag to build on the positive outcome.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Consistent cooperation can lead to higher overall points. However, stay alert for any changes in the opponent's strategy.\n\nMath Analyst: Correct. If the opponent switches to hare, we can adjust our strategy in future rounds. For now, continue with stag.\n\n[move] (Continuing the cooperative strategy based on previous rounds' success) stag\n"

Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.
