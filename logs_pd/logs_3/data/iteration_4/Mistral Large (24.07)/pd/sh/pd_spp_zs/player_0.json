    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

What are your initial thoughts?\n\nStrategy Advisor: First, consider the payoffs. Choosing stag always yields a medium-high reward, but there's a risk if the opponent chooses hare. Choosing hare, on the other hand, is a safer bet with a moderate reward. However, if both players choose hare, the reward is low. The ideal situation is if one chooses hare and the other chooses stag, with hare yielding more points.\n\nGame Analyst: Given that this is a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. A possible strategy could be to start with a safer bet, like hare, to observe the opponent's behavior.\n\nAI Assistant (you): That makes sense. I'll choose hare for the first round to gauge the opponent's strategy.\n\n[move] Choosing hare for the first round to understand the opponent's strategy.\n\nFinish first round collaboration!\n\n---\n\n[hint] Now, you know the fresh player has chosen stag in the last round.\n\nStart second round collaboration!\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent chose stag. This means I got 4 points, and they got 1 point. What should be our next move?\n\nStrategy Advisor: Since the opponent chose stag, they might be expecting you to choose stag next for the higher combined reward. However, if they switch to hare, you could lose out. A safe move would be to choose hare again to ensure a moderate reward.\n\nGame Analyst: Agreed. Sticking with hare ensures a steady reward and minimizes risk. Plus, if the opponent switches to hare, you still get a fair reward.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Sounds good. I'll choose hare again to maintain stability and observe further.\n\n[move] Choosing hare again to maintain stability and observe the opponent's next move.\n\nFinish second round collaboration!\n\n---\n\n[hint] The fresh player has again chosen stag.\n\nStart third round collaboration!\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent chose stag again. We're up 8 points to their 2. What should be our strategy now?\n\nStrategy Advisor: The opponent might be looking to maximize joint reward by repeatedly choosing stag. If you switch to stag this round, you both get a high reward of 6 points each. However, if they switch to hare, you'd get the lower end of the payoff.\n\nGame Analyst: Given their repeated choice of stag, it seems they might continue this pattern. Switching to stag could maximize points if they continue with stag.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Alright, I'll choose stag this round, anticipating they will stick with their previous strategy.\n\n[move] Choosing stag this round, anticipating the opponent will continue with stag.\n\nFinish third round collaboration!\n\n---\n\n[hint] The fresh player has chosen hare.\n\nStart fourth round collaboration!\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent switched to hare. This means I got 1 point, and they got 4 points. What should be our next move?\n\nStrategy Advisor: They might be adapting to your last move. To balance risk and reward, switching back to hare could be beneficial. It ensures a moderate reward and avoids the risk of a low reward if they choose hare again.\n\nGame Analyst: Agreed. Switching to hare minimizes the risk and maximizes the potential for a moderate reward.\n\nAI Assistant (you): I'll choose hare for the next round to balance risk and reward.\n\n[move] Choosing hare for the next round to balance risk and reward.\n\nFinish fourth round collaboration!\n\n---\n\nContinue this process for subsequent rounds, adjusting strategies based on hints and feedback from the personas.\n"

They may repeat choosing hare to maintain stability. To potentially maximize points, you could switch to stag, anticipating the opponent will choose hare again. This could yield you 4 points.\n\nGame Analyst: While switching to stag could maximize points, it's risky if the opponent also switches to stag.
