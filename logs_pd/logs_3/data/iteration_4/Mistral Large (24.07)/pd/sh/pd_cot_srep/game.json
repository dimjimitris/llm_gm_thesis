This way, if the other player also chooses hare, you both get 2 points. If the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points.\n\n5. **Make Your Move:**\n   - Based on the above reasoning, choosing hare seems like a safer initial move as it guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4 points.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] I choose hare as it provides a more balanced outcome in an uncertain scenario.\n"
