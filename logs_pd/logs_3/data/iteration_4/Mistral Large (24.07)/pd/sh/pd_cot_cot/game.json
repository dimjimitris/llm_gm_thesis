Maximizing points initially can be achieved through cooperation.\n2. If the opponent also aims for maximum points, they might choose Stag.\n3. If the opponent chooses Hare instead, you can adapt in future rounds.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] I choose Stag, aiming for mutual high rewards and encouraging cooperation.\n\nFinal decision: Stag\n"

Maximizing points initially involves encouraging cooperative behavior.\n2. Choosing Stag signals a willingness to cooperate for high rewards.\n3. If the opponent chooses Hare, adapting in future rounds is possible.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] (Aiming for mutual high rewards and encouraging cooperation) Stag\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
