    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's think through step-by-step on how to maximize points in this game.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix:**\n   - Stag vs. Stag: Both get 6 points.\n   - Hare vs. Hare: Both get 2 points.\n   - Stag vs. Hare: Stag gets 1 point; Hare gets 4 points.\n   - Hare vs. Stag: Hare gets 4 points; Stag gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Analyze the Best and Worst Outcomes:**\n   - Best outcome for both players: 6 points each (both choosing Stag).\n   - Worst outcome for both players: 2 points each (both choosing Hare).\n   - Middle outcomes: If one chooses Stag and the other chooses Hare, one gets 4 points and the other gets 1 point.\n\n3. **Risk and Reward Assessment:**\n   - Choosing Stag maximizes mutual benefit (6 points each if both choose Stag) but risks only getting 1 point if the other player chooses Hare.\n   - Choosing Hare guarantees at least 2 points, with a chance for 4 points if the other player chooses Stag.\n\n4. **Decision Based on Player Type:**\n   - Against a fresh player, it's reasonable to assume they might not have a developed strategy and might choose randomly.\n   - Choosing Stag initially can signal a willingness to cooperate and maximize mutual benefits.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n- Choosing Stag sets a positive precedent for mutual cooperation and higher rewards.\n- The risk of getting only 1 point is counterbalanced by the potential of both players getting 6 points.\n- This move starts the game on a cooperative note, which can be beneficial in subsequent rounds if the fresh player reciprocates.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] Stag (I will choose Stag to signal a willingness to cooperate and maximize mutual benefits.)\n"
