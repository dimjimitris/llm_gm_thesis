    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

AI Assistant (you)\n\n### Begin Collaboration\n\n#### Round 1\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** We are playing the game against a fresh player. What should our initial move be?\n\n**Game Strategist:** Since we don't have information about the opponent's strategy, starting with a neutral move that can provide relatively stable points can be a good strategy. Choosing \"stag\" can yield high points if the opponent also chooses \"stag,\" but if they choose \"hare,\" we get fewer points.\n\n**Logical Thinker:** Let's consider the payoff matrix. Choosing \"stag\" is high-risk, high-reward, while choosing \"hare\" offers a safer, moderate reward. Since we are playing against a fresh player, they might also choose \"stag\" to maximize their points, so we might want to take a safer approach initially.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Taking into consideration your suggestions, let's start with \"hare\" to minimize risk in the first round.\n\n#### Round 2\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** What should be our next move based on the first round's outcome?\n\n**Game Strategist:** If we both chose \"hare\" in the first round, we can see if the opponent aims for higher points in the next round by switching to \"stag.\" This could be a good time to switch to \"stag\" ourselves if the opponent thinks we will stick with \"hare.\"\n\n**Logical Thinker:** If the opponent chose \"stag\" in the first round, they might switch to \"hare\" to avoid the lowest points. In that case, we should choose \"stag\" to take advantage of their potential switch.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Given the various possibilities, strategically choosing \"stag\" this round seems optimal.\n\n#### Round 3\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Considering the outcomes of the previous rounds, what should our move be?\n\n**Game Strategist:** If we both chose \"stag\" in the second round, the opponent might switch to \"hare\" to avoid the low points if they think we will choose \"stag\" again. We can switch to \"hare\" to minimize the risk.\n\n**Logical Thinker:** If the opponent chose \"hare\" in the second round, they might choose \"stag\" this time. We should choose \"hare\" to take advantage of their potential switch.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Alright, based on the possible outcomes, let's choose \"hare\" this round.\n\n#### Round 4\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** What should our move be based on the previous rounds?\n\n**Game Strategist:** We need to observe the pattern. If the opponent has been switching moves, we should switch as well. If they have been consistent, we might want to stick with \"hare.\"\n\n**Logical Thinker:** If the opponent has been unpredictable, sticking with the previous safe choice of \"hare\" might be a good strategy to avoid a big loss.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Considering the patterns, let's stick with \"hare\" for consistency.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n1. Round 1: [move] Hare\n2. Round 2: [move] Stag\n3. Round 3: [move] Hare\n4. Round 4: [move] Hare\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: The strategy involves minimizing risk by starting with a safer move and adjusting based on the opponent's likely actions. The sequence of moves is designed to maximize points while considering the payoff matrix.\n"

Choosing \"stag\" can yield high points if the opponent also chooses \"stag,\" but if they choose \"hare,\" we get fewer points.\n\n**Logical Thinker**: Let's consider the payoff matrix. Choosing \"stag\" is high-risk, high-reward, while choosing \"hare\" offers a safer, moderate reward. Since we are playing against an unknown player, they might also choose \"stag\" to maximize their points. We might want to take a safer approach initially.\n\n**AI Assistant** (you): [move] (Starting with a safer choice to minimize risk) Hare\n\n#### Round 2\n\n**Game Strategist**: If we both chose \"hare\" in the first round, we can see if the opponent aims for higher points in the next round by switching to \"stag.\" This could be a good time to switch to \"stag\" ourselves if the opponent thinks we will stick with \"hare.\"\n\n**Logical Thinker**: If the opponent chose \"stag\" in the first round, they might switch to \"hare\" to avoid the lowest points. In that case, we should choose \"stag\" to take advantage of their potential switch.\n\n**AI Assistant** (you): [move] (Taking a calculated risk to maximize points) Stag\n\n#### Round 3\n\n**Game Strategist**: If we both chose \"stag\" in the second round, the opponent might switch to \"hare\" to avoid the low points if they think we will choose \"stag\" again. We can switch to \"hare\" to minimize the risk.\n\n**Logical Thinker**: If the opponent chose \"hare\" in the second round, they might choose \"stag\" this time. We should choose \"hare\" to take advantage of their potential switch.\n\n**AI Assistant** (you): [move] (Switching to minimize risk) Hare\n\n#### Round 4\n\n**Game Strategist**: We need to observe the pattern. If the opponent has been switching moves, we should switch as well. If they have been consistent, we might want to stick with \"hare.\"\n\n**Logical Thinker**: If the opponent has been unpredictable, sticking with the previous safe choice of \"hare\" might be a good strategy to avoid a big loss.\n\n**AI Assistant** (you): [move] (Sticking with the safe choice for consistency) Hare\n\n### Final Decision\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n1. Round 1: [move] (Starting with a safer choice to minimize risk) Hare\n2. Round 2: [move] (Taking a calculated risk to maximize points) Stag\n3. Round 3: [move] (Switching to minimize risk) Hare\n4. Round 4: [move] (Sticking with the safe choice for consistency) Hare\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: The strategy involves minimizing risk by starting with a safer move and adjusting based on the opponent's likely actions.
