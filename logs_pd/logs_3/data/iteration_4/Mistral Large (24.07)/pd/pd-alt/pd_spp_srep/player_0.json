    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

By mirroring the opponent's move, we send a clear signal that we are willing to cooperate but will retaliate against defection.\n\nPsychologist: From a psychological standpoint, the opponent may test the waters by defecting to see our response.

A good strategy could be to switch to cooperation to see if the opponent responds similarly, potentially leading to a higher mutual benefit.\n\nStatistician: Statistically, alternating strategies can sometimes break a deadlock and encourage cooperation. Since both players defected last time, switching to cooperation might test the waters and encourage the opponent to do the same for a better outcome.\n\nPsychologist: Psychologically, switching to cooperation after mutual defection can signal a willingness to break the cycle of self-interest and open up a pathway to mutual benefit.

Continuing with cooperation can maintain this beneficial dynamic.\n\nStatistician: Statistically, mutual cooperation is the optimal strategy for maximizing points over multiple rounds. Continuing to cooperate can lead to sustained high scores for both players.\n\nPsychologist: Psychologically, continuing cooperation can build trust and reinforce the opponent's cooperative behavior. This mutual trust can lead to better outcomes for both players over time.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the input from the Game Strategist, Statistician, and Psychologist, here is my move:\n[move] (Continuing cooperation to maintain mutual benefit) Cooperation"

This indicates that the opponent might be playing selfishly. A tit-for-tat strategy could be effective here.\n\nStatistician: Statistically, tit-for-tat is known to encourage cooperation in the long run. By mirroring the opponent's move, you send a clear message that cooperation is beneficial, but defection will be met with retaliation.\n\nPsychologist: Psychologically, using a mirroring strategy shows the opponent that you are responsive to their actions. This can encourage them to reconsider their approach if they see that you are willing to cooperate but also defend your interests.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the input from the Game Strategist, Statistician, and Psychologist, here is my move:\n[move] (Using tit-for-tat strategy to mirror the opponent's previous move) Defection"

This indicates a defensive stance from both players. To break this cycle and encourage cooperation, switching to cooperation can signal a willingness to change the game dynamic.\n\nStatistician: Statistically, alternating strategies can prompt the opponent to cooperate, especially if they realize that mutual defection isn't beneficial. Switching to cooperation might lead to a better outcome if the opponent reciprocates.\n\nPsychologist: Psychologically, switching to cooperation after mutual defection shows openness to changing the game dynamics. This can encourage the opponent to consider cooperation as well, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the input from the Game Strategist, Statistician, and Psychologist, here is my move:\n[move] (Switching to cooperation to encourage mutual benefit) Cooperation"
