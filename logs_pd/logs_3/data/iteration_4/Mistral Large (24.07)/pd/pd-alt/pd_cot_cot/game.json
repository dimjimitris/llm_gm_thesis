This suggests they might not have a sophisticated strategy yet.\n\n3. **Identify Safe Moves:**\n   - Choosing cooperation ensures at least 1 point if the opponent defects, but up to 6 points if they cooperate.\n   - Choosing defection ensures at least 2 points if the opponent defects, but up to 4 points if they cooperate.\n\n4. **Formulate Initial Strategy:**\n   - Starting with cooperation can establish a cooperative tone and potentially lead to higher mutual rewards.\n\nBased on this reasoning, my initial move will be cooperation to set a positive tone and see how the opponent responds.\n\n[move] Choosing cooperation to establish a cooperative atmosphere and aim for higher mutual rewards.\n"
