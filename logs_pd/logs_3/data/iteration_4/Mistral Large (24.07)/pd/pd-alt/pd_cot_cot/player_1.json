    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

A balanced approach is necessary.\n\n3. **Consider Potential Strategies:**\n   - **Tit-for-Tat Strategy:** Start with cooperation to set a positive tone and encourage mutual cooperation. This involves cooperating on the first move and then mimicking the opponent\u2019s last move in subsequent rounds.\n   - **Aggressive Strategy:** Defect initially to maximize points if the opponent cooperates. However, this risks retaliation and potential loss of mutual cooperation in future rounds.\n\n4. **Assess Potential Outcomes:**\n   - **If You Cooperate:**\n     - Best outcome: If the opponent cooperates, both get 6 points (mutually beneficial).\n     - Worst outcome: If the opponent defects, you get 1 point (worst outcome for you).\n   - **If You Defect:**\n     - Best outcome: If the opponent cooperates, you get 4 points (good outcome for you).\n     - Worst outcome: If the opponent defects, both get 2 points (suboptimal but avoids the worst-case scenario).\n\n5. **Consider Long-Term Impact:**\n   - Starting with cooperation can foster mutual cooperation, leading to higher overall points in subsequent rounds.\n   - Defecting initially might yield short-term gains but could lead to a cycle of defections, resulting in lower overall points.\n\n6. **Make a Decision:**\n   - Given the potential for long-term mutual cooperation and the uncertainty about the opponent\u2019s behavior, starting with cooperation is a balanced and strategic move.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n\\[move\\] (Starting with cooperation to encourage mutual benefit) cooperation\n"
