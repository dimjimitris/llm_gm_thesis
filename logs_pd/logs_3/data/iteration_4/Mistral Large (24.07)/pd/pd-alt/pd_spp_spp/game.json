It maintains the potential for high mutual benefit (6 points) and avoids the significant loss associated with defecting against a cooperative opponent (1 point).\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Thank you for your insights.

Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake.
