Consider possible outcomes:\n   - If I play stag, I could get 4 points (if opponent plays stag) or 1 point (if opponent plays hare).\n   - If I play hare, I could get 2 points (if opponent plays hare) or 6 points (if opponent plays stag).\n\n4. Evaluate risks:\n   - Playing stag has a lower risk (guaranteed 1 point) but also lower maximum reward (4 points).\n   - Playing hare has a higher risk (could get only 2 points) but also higher maximum reward (6 points).\n\n5.
