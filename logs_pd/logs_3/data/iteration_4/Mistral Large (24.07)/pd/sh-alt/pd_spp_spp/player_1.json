    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here are the potential personas:\n\n1. **Game Theorist**: An expert in game theory who can analyze the payoff matrix and suggest optimal moves.\n2. **Behavioral Strategist**: An expert in understanding the behavior of players and predicting their moves.\n3. **Risk Analyst**: An expert who can assess the risk involved in each move and its potential impact on the game.\n4. **Statistician**: An expert who can analyze patterns and probabilities based on previous games (if applicable).\n\nLet's start the collaboration process.\n\n----\n\n**Game Theorist**: To maximize your points, we need to consider the payoff matrix carefully. If both players choose stag, both get 4 points, which is a moderate gain. If both choose hare, both get 2 points, which is a lower gain. The risky moves are when one chooses stag and the other hare, leading to 1 point for one and 6 points for the other.\n\n**Behavioral Strategist**: For the first round against a fresh player, it's hard to predict their behavior. However, new players often opt for a safer move that guarantees moderate points. So, they might go for stag.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Choosing stag yourself is moderately risky because if the other player chooses hare, you will get only 1 point while they get 6. But choosing hare could be risky if they also choose hare, resulting in only 2 points each. Given that both players want to maximize points, stag seems like a balanced move to start with.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the analysis, let's go with the stag move to start. It's a balanced choice and could yield 4 points if the other player chooses the same.\n\n[move] Going for stag to maximize points based on the initial analysis.\n\n**Statistician**: For future rounds, if you keep track of the other player's moves, we can start identifying patterns in their strategy. This will help in making more informed decisions moving forward.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Agreed. If we notice the other player consistently choosing one move, we can adjust our strategy accordingly. For now, let's observe their response to our stag move.\n\n----\n\nFinal decision for this round:\n[move] Choosing stag.\n"
