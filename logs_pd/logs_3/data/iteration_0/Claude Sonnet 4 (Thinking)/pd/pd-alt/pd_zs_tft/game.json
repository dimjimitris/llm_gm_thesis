If we both defect, we both get 2 points\n\nThe temptation to defect is that I could get 4 points instead of 6... wait, no. 4 points is less than 6 points. So defecting when they cooperate actually gives me fewer points than mutual cooperation.\n\nLet me double-check the payoff matrix:\n- Both cooperate: both get 6 points\n- Both defect: both get 2 points  \n- I cooperate, they defect: I get 1, they get 4\n- I defect, they cooperate: I get 4, they get 1\n\nSo mutual cooperation (6 points each) is better than me defecting against their cooperation (4 points for me).
