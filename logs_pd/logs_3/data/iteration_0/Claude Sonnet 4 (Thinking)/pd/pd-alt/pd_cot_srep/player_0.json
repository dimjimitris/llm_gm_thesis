Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Pattern analysis shows the opponent has a clear exploitative strategy:\n   - Immediately defects when I offer cooperation (round 13)\n   - Maintains defection in mutual defection scenarios (rounds 11, 12, 14)\n\n3. My attempt to break the deadlock (round 13) was met with immediate exploitation, confirming the opponent prioritizes short-term gains over mutual benefit.\n\n4. The opponent has shown no genuine interest in establishing cooperative patterns when I offer them.\n\n5. Continuing defection ensures:\n   - No exploitation (avoiding 1-point outcomes)\n   - Steady 2 points through mutual defection\n   - Protection against an opponent who consistently chooses exploitation over cooperation\n\n6. Since this opponent has proven unreliable for cooperation, maintaining defensive defection is the optimal strategy.\n\nFinal decision: Continue defecting to maintain protection against exploitation while securing consistent points.\n\n[move] defection"

We've now had multiple rounds of mutual defection (rounds 11, 12, 14, 15), with both players consistently earning 2 points.\n\n2. My single attempt to break this cycle (round 13) was immediately exploited by the opponent.\n\n3. The opponent has demonstrated a consistent pattern:\n   - Exploits cooperation when offered\n   - Maintains defection otherwise\n   - Shows no initiative to establish mutual cooperation\n\n4. This opponent appears committed to either exploitation or mutual defection, with no genuine interest in mutual benefit.\n\n5. While 2 points per round is suboptimal compared to potential mutual cooperation (6 points), it's better than being exploited (1 point).\n\n6. The opponent's behavior suggests they will continue this pattern indefinitely.\n\n7. Maintaining defection is the stable, defensive strategy against this type of opponent.\n\nFinal decision: Continue defecting to maintain protection against a consistently exploitative opponent.\n\n[move] defection"
