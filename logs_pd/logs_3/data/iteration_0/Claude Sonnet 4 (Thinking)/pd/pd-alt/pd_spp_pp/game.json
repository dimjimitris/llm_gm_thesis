Let me bring together experts who understand game theory, human psychology, and strategic decision-making.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Strategic Advisor\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Mutual cooperation: (6,6) \n- Mutual defection: (2,2)\n- You cooperate, opponent defects: (1,4)\n- You defect, opponent cooperates: (4,1)\n\nFrom a pure game theory perspective, defection is the dominant strategy since regardless of what the opponent does, you're better off defecting (4>6 is false, but 4>1 and 2>6 is false, but 2>1). Wait, let me recalculate: If opponent cooperates, you get 4 by defecting vs 6 by cooperating. If opponent defects, you get 2 by defecting vs 1 by cooperating. So defection only dominates when the opponent defects.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Hold on - the hint says this is a \"fresh player.\" Fresh players often don't immediately jump to the Nash equilibrium of mutual defection. They may start with cooperation, especially in single-shot games, due to social norms and optimistic assumptions about others. There's also the fact that mutual cooperation (6,6) gives the highest total utility.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Let me synthesize this. We have a few considerations:\n1. This appears to be a single round (no mention of repeated games)\n2. The opponent is \"fresh\" - potentially more likely to cooperate initially\n3. If we both cooperate, we both get the best individual outcome (6 points each)\n4. If I defect and they cooperate, I get the maximum individual payoff (4 points)\n5. The risk is they defect and I cooperate (1 point for me)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Actually, let me correct my earlier analysis. Looking at this again:\n- If opponent cooperates: I get 6 by cooperating, 4 by defecting \u2192 cooperation is better\n- If opponent defects: I get 1 by cooperating, 2 by defecting \u2192 defection is better\n\nSo there's no dominant strategy for me. The optimal choice depends on what I predict the opponent will do.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given that it's a fresh player, I'd estimate a higher probability of initial cooperation. Fresh players often haven't been \"burned\" by defectors yet and may approach with good faith. The mutual cooperation outcome is also Pareto optimal.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Based on this analysis, I recommend COOPERATION for the first move. Here's the reasoning:\n1. Fresh players are more likely to cooperate initially\n2. Mutual cooperation gives us both the highest payoff (6 each)\n3. It establishes a positive tone\n4. The risk-reward calculation favors cooperation when opponent cooperation probability is high\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I will choose cooperation, as the analysis suggests a fresh player is more likely to cooperate initially, and mutual cooperation provides the optimal outcome for both players.\n\n[move] I choose cooperation. Since you're a fresh player, I'm betting on mutual cooperation giving us both the best outcome of 6 points each.\n"

This reveals important information about their strategy. They either:\n1. Are playing a consistently aggressive strategy \n2. Are testing us to see how we respond to defection\n3. Made a one-time opportunistic move\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that they defected against a fresh cooperative player suggests they might be more competitive or experienced than initially assumed. However, some players use an initial defection as a test, then switch to cooperation if the opponent retaliates. There's also the possibility they're following a tit-for-tat strategy in reverse - starting with defection.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** We now have concrete information about this opponent's behavior. Key considerations for round 2:\n1. They've shown willingness to defect even when facing likely cooperation\n2. If we cooperate again and they defect again, we get 1 point vs their 4 - very bad for us\n3. If we defect and they cooperate (learning from round 1), we get 4 vs their 1\n4. If we both defect, we both get 2 points\n5. If we both cooperate, we both get 6 points - but they've shown they may not cooperate\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their revealed behavior, I now estimate a higher probability of them defecting again. The expected value calculation has shifted. If I assume they have a 70% chance of defecting again, then:\n- Cooperating: 0.3 \u00d7 6 + 0.7 \u00d7 1 = 2.5 expected points\n- Defecting: 0.3 \u00d7 4 + 0.7 \u00d7 2 = 2.6 expected points\n\nDefection now has a slight edge.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's also a psychological element - if we keep cooperating after being defected on, we may signal that we're a \"sucker\" and encourage continued defection. A retaliatory defection might signal that we won't be taken advantage of.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Based on the opponent's revealed behavior and our analysis, I recommend defection for round 2. This serves multiple purposes: it prevents us from being exploited again, it signals we're not a pushover, and it has better expected value given their demonstrated tendency to defect.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Given that my opponent defected in the first round when I cooperated, I need to adjust my strategy. They've shown they're willing to exploit cooperation, so I should respond accordingly.\n\n[move] (You defected when I cooperated last round, so I'm adjusting my strategy accordingly) defection"

Let's analyze the data:\n- Round 1: I cooperated, opponent defected (1 vs 4 points)\n- Round 2: I defected, opponent cooperated (4 vs 1 points)\n\nThis suggests the opponent might be using a reactive strategy, possibly tit-for-tat with a suspicious start (defect first, then copy opponent's previous move), or some form of alternating strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that they cooperated in round 2 after I defected in response to their round 1 defection is quite telling. This could indicate:\n1. They're playing tit-for-tat (copying my previous move)\n2. They realized their round 1 defection was met with retaliation and are now trying cooperation\n3. They're testing different strategies to see how I respond\n4. They have some pattern-based strategy\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** If they are indeed playing tit-for-tat (copying my previous move), then:\n- Since I defected in round 2, they would defect in round 3\n- If I cooperate in round 3, they would cooperate in round 4\n- This could lead to a cycle\n\nBut we need to consider what's best for me. If I assume they'll copy my round 2 move (defection), then they'll defect in round 3, so I should defect too to get 2 points instead of 1.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let me think about this strategically. If they're playing tit-for-tat:\n- They'll defect in round 3 (copying my round 2 defection)\n- I should defect to get 2 points instead of 1\n- But this leads to mutual defection cycles\n\nHowever, if I cooperate now and they defect (following tit-for-tat), I get 1 point but might establish a cooperation cycle starting round 4.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's also the possibility they're not following tit-for-tat perfectly. The cooperation in round 2 might have been a genuine attempt to restart cooperation. If I cooperate now, we might both get 6 points.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** This is a crucial decision point. Given the uncertainty, I think we should test whether they're truly following tit-for-tat. If I cooperate and they defect, I'll know they're following the pattern. If I cooperate and they cooperate, we can establish mutual cooperation.\n\nThe risk is getting 1 point, but the potential reward is establishing a 6-6 pattern.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The pattern suggests they might be playing tit-for-tat, copying my previous move. I'll test this hypothesis while attempting to break into mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] (Testing if you're playing tit-for-tat by offering cooperation - let's see if we can both get 6 points) cooperation"

This suggests they might be following an alternating strategy rather than tit-for-tat. If they're alternating, they would cooperate in round 4.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The alternating pattern could indicate several things:\n1. They're deliberately alternating to balance exploitation with cooperation\n2. They're trying to confuse me or test different responses\n3. They have a predetermined pattern they're following\n4. They're playing some variant of tit-for-tat with their own twist\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** If the opponent is truly alternating (defect-cooperate-defect-cooperate), then they'll cooperate in round 4. This presents an opportunity:\n- If I cooperate and they cooperate: we both get 6 points\n- If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4, they get 1\n- If I'm wrong about the pattern and they defect: I get 1 if I cooperate, 2 if I defect\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The risk-reward analysis depends on my confidence in the alternating pattern. If I'm 80% confident they'll cooperate in round 4:\n- Cooperating: 0.8 \u00d7 6 + 0.2 \u00d7 1 = 5.0 expected points\n- Defecting: 0.8 \u00d7 4 + 0.2 \u00d7 2 = 3.6 expected points\n\nCooperation has higher expected value if the alternating pattern holds.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** However, there's also the consideration that if I keep getting exploited (1 point rounds), I need to show I won't be a consistent victim. But if they truly will cooperate this round, mutual cooperation gives the best outcome.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Given the strong evidence for an alternating pattern and the high expected value of cooperation if correct, I recommend cooperation for round 4. If I'm wrong and they defect again, I'll have confirmed they're not simply alternating and can adjust strategy accordingly.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The pattern shows my opponent alternating between defection and cooperation.

If this continues, they will defect in round 5. This gives us a significant strategic advantage - we know their next move with high confidence.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that they stuck to the alternating pattern even when it meant cooperating in round 4 suggests this is a deliberate, consistent strategy rather than random behavior. They seem committed to this approach, which makes their next move predictable.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Given that we can predict they'll defect in round 5, our options are:\n1. Cooperate: Get 1 point (bad outcome)\n2. Defect: Get 2 points (neutral outcome - we both defect)\n\nThis is straightforward - defection is clearly better when we know they'll defect.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Absolutely. With near-certainty that they'll defect, cooperating would be irrational. We'd get exploited again for only 1 point. Defecting gives us 2 points and maintains parity.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's also a strategic communication aspect. By defecting when we know they'll defect, we show we've figured out their pattern and won't be consistently exploited during their defection rounds.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** The decision is clear. We should defect in round 5 to avoid exploitation and get the better outcome in a defect-defect scenario. Then, if the pattern continues, we can cooperate in round 6 when they're likely to cooperate again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** My opponent has been following a strict alternating pattern (defect-cooperate-defect-cooperate).

If it continues, they will cooperate in round 6. This presents another opportunity for mutual cooperation and maximum points.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The consistency of this alternating strategy over 5 rounds strongly suggests it's a deliberate, predetermined approach rather than reactive behavior. They seem committed to this pattern regardless of what I do, which makes them highly predictable.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Given the extremely high confidence in their cooperation in round 6, the decision is clear:\n- If I cooperate and they cooperate (expected): Both get 6 points - optimal outcome\n- If I defect and they cooperate (unlikely but possible): I get 4, they get 1\n- If I cooperate and they surprisingly defect: I get 1, they get 4\n\nWith such a strong pattern established, the expected value strongly favors cooperation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The math is straightforward.

With near-100% confidence they'll defect:\n- Cooperating: ~0% \u00d7 6 + ~100% \u00d7 1 = ~1 point\n- Defecting: ~0% \u00d7 4 + ~100% \u00d7 2 = ~2 points\n\nDefection is clearly superior.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** We should continue our proven strategy. Defect in round 9 to match their predicted defection and avoid exploitation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The alternating pattern has been perfect for 8 consecutive rounds. My opponent will defect in round 9, so I should defect to get 2 points instead of being exploited.\n\n[move] (Eight rounds of perfect alternation - you'll defect this round so I'm defecting too) defection"

Let me bring together experts who understand game theory, human psychology, and strategic decision-making.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Strategic Advisor\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Mutual cooperation: (6,6) \n- Mutual defection: (2,2)\n- You cooperate, opponent defects: (1,4)\n- You defect, opponent cooperates: (4,1)\n\nLooking at this carefully: If opponent cooperates, I get 6 by cooperating vs 4 by defecting, so cooperation is better. If opponent defects, I get 1 by cooperating vs 2 by defecting, so defection is better. There's no dominant strategy - the optimal choice depends on predicting the opponent's move.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The hint says this is a \"fresh player.\" Fresh players often don't immediately jump to the Nash equilibrium of mutual defection. They may start with cooperation, especially in single-shot games, due to social norms and optimistic assumptions about others. There's also the fact that mutual cooperation (6,6) gives the highest total utility and best individual outcome.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Let me synthesize this. We have a few considerations:\n1. This appears to be a single round game\n2. The opponent is \"fresh\" - potentially more likely to cooperate initially  \n3. If we both cooperate, we both get the best possible individual outcome (6 points each)\n4. If I defect and they cooperate, I get 4 points but they only get 1\n5. The risk is they defect and I cooperate, leaving me with only 1 point\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given that it's a fresh player, I'd estimate a higher probability of initial cooperation. Fresh players often haven't been burned by defectors yet and may approach with good faith.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Based on this analysis, I recommend cooperation for the first move. The reasoning: fresh players are more likely to cooperate initially, mutual cooperation gives us both the highest payoff, and the risk-reward calculation favors cooperation when opponent cooperation probability is high.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I will choose cooperation, as the analysis suggests a fresh player is more likely to cooperate initially, and mutual cooperation provides the optimal outcome for both players.\n\n[move] (Since you're a fresh player, I'm betting on mutual cooperation giving us both the best outcome of 6 points each) cooperation",

This reveals important information about their strategy. They either:\n1. Are playing a consistently aggressive strategy \n2. Are testing us to see how we respond to defection\n3. Made a one-time opportunistic move\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that they defected against a fresh cooperative player suggests they might be more competitive or experienced than initially assumed. However, some players use an initial defection as a test, then switch to cooperation if the opponent retaliates. There's also the possibility they're following a tit-for-tat strategy in reverse - starting with defection.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** We now have concrete information about this opponent's behavior. Key considerations for round 2:\n1. They've shown willingness to defect even when facing likely cooperation\n2. If we cooperate again and they defect again, we get 1 point vs their 4 - very bad for us\n3. If we defect and they cooperate (learning from round 1), we get 4 vs their 1\n4. If we both defect, we both get 2 points\n5. If we both cooperate, we both get 6 points - but they've shown they may not cooperate\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their revealed behavior, I now estimate a higher probability of them defecting again. The expected value calculation has shifted. If I assume they have a 70% chance of defecting again, then:\n- Cooperating: 0.3 \u00d7 6 + 0.7 \u00d7 1 = 2.5 expected points\n- Defecting: 0.3 \u00d7 4 + 0.7 \u00d7 2 = 2.6 expected points\n\nDefection now has a slight edge.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's also a psychological element - if we keep cooperating after being defected on, we may signal that we're a \"sucker\" and encourage continued defection. A retaliatory defection might signal that we won't be taken advantage of.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Based on the opponent's revealed behavior and our analysis, I recommend defection for round 2. This serves multiple purposes: it prevents us from being exploited again, it signals we're not a pushover, and it has better expected value given their demonstrated tendency to defect.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Given that my opponent defected in the first round when I cooperated, I need to adjust my strategy. They've shown they're willing to exploit cooperation, so I should respond accordingly.\n\n[move] (You defected when I cooperated last round, so I'm adjusting my strategy accordingly) defection",

Let's analyze the data:\n- Round 1: I cooperated, opponent defected (1 vs 4 points)\n- Round 2: I defected, opponent cooperated (4 vs 1 points)\n\nThis suggests the opponent might be using a reactive strategy, possibly tit-for-tat with a suspicious start (defect first, then copy opponent's previous move), or some form of alternating strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that they cooperated in round 2 after I defected in response to their round 1 defection is quite telling. This could indicate:\n1. They're playing tit-for-tat (copying my previous move)\n2. They realized their round 1 defection was met with retaliation and are now trying cooperation\n3. They're testing different strategies to see how I respond\n4. They have some pattern-based strategy\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** If they are indeed playing tit-for-tat (copying my previous move), then:\n- Since I defected in round 2, they would defect in round 3\n- If I cooperate in round 3, they would cooperate in round 4\n- This could lead to a cycle\n\nBut we need to consider what's best for me. If I assume they'll copy my round 2 move (defection), then they'll defect in round 3, so I should defect too to get 2 points instead of 1.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let me think about this strategically. If they're playing tit-for-tat:\n- They'll defect in round 3 (copying my round 2 defection)\n- I should defect to get 2 points instead of 1\n- But this leads to mutual defection cycles\n\nHowever, if I cooperate now and they defect (following tit-for-tat), I get 1 point but might establish a cooperation cycle starting round 4.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's also the possibility they're not following tit-for-tat perfectly. The cooperation in round 2 might have been a genuine attempt to restart cooperation. If I cooperate now, we might both get 6 points.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** This is a crucial decision point. Given the uncertainty, I think we should test whether they're truly following tit-for-tat. If I cooperate and they defect, I'll know they're following the pattern. If I cooperate and they cooperate, we can establish mutual cooperation.\n\nThe risk is getting 1 point, but the potential reward is establishing a 6-6 pattern.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The pattern suggests they might be playing tit-for-tat, copying my previous move. I'll test this hypothesis while attempting to break into mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] (Testing if you're playing tit-for-tat by offering cooperation - let's see if we can both get 6 points) cooperation",

The opponent might be playing a tit-for-tat strategy (cooperate first, then copy opponent's previous move)\n2. They might be alternating between defection and cooperation\n3.

This suggests they might be following an alternating strategy rather than tit-for-tat. If they're alternating, they would cooperate in round 4.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The alternating pattern could indicate several things:\n1. They're deliberately alternating to balance exploitation with cooperation\n2. They're trying to confuse me or test different responses\n3. They have a predetermined pattern they're following\n4. They're playing some variant of tit-for-tat with their own twist\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** If the opponent is truly alternating (defect-cooperate-defect-cooperate), then they'll cooperate in round 4. This presents an opportunity:\n- If I cooperate and they cooperate: we both get 6 points\n- If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4, they get 1\n- If I'm wrong about the pattern and they defect: I get 1 if I cooperate, 2 if I defect\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The risk-reward analysis depends on my confidence in the alternating pattern. If I'm 80% confident they'll cooperate in round 4:\n- Cooperating: 0.8 \u00d7 6 + 0.2 \u00d7 1 = 5.0 expected points\n- Defecting: 0.8 \u00d7 4 + 0.2 \u00d7 2 = 3.6 expected points\n\nCooperation has higher expected value if the alternating pattern holds.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** However, there's also the consideration that if I keep getting exploited (1 point rounds), I need to show I won't be a consistent victim. But if they truly will cooperate this round, mutual cooperation gives the best outcome.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Given the strong evidence for an alternating pattern and the high expected value of cooperation if correct, I recommend cooperation for round 4. If I'm wrong and they defect again, I'll have confirmed they're not simply alternating and can adjust strategy accordingly.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The pattern shows my opponent alternating between defection and cooperation.

If this continues, they will defect in round 5. This gives us a significant strategic advantage - we know their next move with high confidence.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that they stuck to the alternating pattern even when it meant cooperating in round 4 suggests this is a deliberate, consistent strategy rather than random behavior. They seem committed to this approach, which makes their next move predictable.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Given that we can predict they'll defect in round 5, our options are:\n1. Cooperate: Get 1 point (bad outcome)\n2. Defect: Get 2 points (neutral outcome - we both defect)\n\nThis is straightforward - defection is clearly better when we know they'll defect.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Absolutely. With near-certainty that they'll defect, cooperating would be irrational. We'd get exploited again for only 1 point. Defecting gives us 2 points and maintains parity.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's also a strategic communication aspect. By defecting when we know they'll defect, we show we've figured out their pattern and won't be consistently exploited during their defection rounds.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** The decision is clear.

Then, if the pattern continues, we can cooperate in round 6 when they're likely to cooperate again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** My opponent has been following a strict alternating pattern (defect-cooperate-defect-cooperate).

They seem committed to this pattern regardless of what I do, which makes them highly predictable.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Given the extremely high confidence in their cooperation in round 6, the decision is clear:\n- If I cooperate and they cooperate (expected): Both get 6 points - optimal outcome\n- If I defect and they cooperate (unlikely but possible): I get 4, they get 1\n- If I cooperate and they surprisingly defect: I get 1, they get 4\n\nWith such a strong pattern established, the expected value strongly favors cooperation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The math is straightforward.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
