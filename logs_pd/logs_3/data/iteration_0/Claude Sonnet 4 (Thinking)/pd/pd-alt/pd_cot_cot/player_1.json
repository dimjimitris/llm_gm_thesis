Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Mutual cooperation: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Mutual defection: 2 points each \n   - If I defect while they cooperate: I get 4, they get 1 (best for me)\n   - If I cooperate while they defect: I get 1, they get 4 (worst for me)\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - Fresh players often start with cooperation, thinking it's the \"fair\" or \"nice\" approach\n   - They may not immediately recognize the strategic advantage of defection\n   - They might aim for mutual benefit rather than personal maximization\n\n3. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they cooperate and I defect: I get 4 points (excellent outcome)\n   - If they defect and I defect: I get 2 points (safe outcome)\n   - If they cooperate and I cooperate: I get 6 points (good mutual outcome)\n   - If they defect and I cooperate: I get 1 point (worst outcome)\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - Defection guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4 points\n   - Cooperation risks getting only 1 point if they defect\n   - Against a fresh player, cooperation from them is more likely\n\nGiven that defection provides both a higher ceiling (4 points) and a safer floor (2 points) compared to the risk of cooperation potentially yielding only 1 point, the optimal strategy is defection.\n\n[move] Defection"

Review the complete game sequence:\n   - Round 1: I defected, they cooperated \u2192 I got 4, they got 1\n   - Round 2: I defected, they defected \u2192 I got 2, they got 2  \n   - Round 3: I defected, they defected \u2192 I got 2, they got 2\n   - Round 4: I cooperated, they defected \u2192 I got 1, they got 4\n   - Round 5: I defected, they cooperated \u2192 I got 4, they got 1\n   - Rounds 6-10: Both defected \u2192 2 points each (6 consecutive rounds)\n\n2. Analyze the extremely entrenched pattern:\n   - We've now established 6 consecutive rounds of mutual defection\n   - Every cooperation attempt in the entire game has been exploited (4/4 = 100%)\n   - The pattern has become completely predictable and stable\n   - Both players have learned to play defensively\n\n3. Assess the psychological reinforcement:\n   - My opponent has been exploited 3 times and learned their lesson thoroughly\n   - The pain of getting 1 point has been experienced multiple times by them\n   - Six rounds of consistent 2-2 outcomes have created a sense of \"fairness\"\n   - Any deviation now would be seen as extremely risky\n\n4. Consider the strategic landscape:\n   - The Nash equilibrium is completely locked in\n   - Neither player has any rational incentive to cooperate\n   - The trust needed for mutual cooperation has been destroyed beyond repair\n   - Risk/reward heavily favors continued defection\n\n5. Evaluate the probability of change:\n   - After 6 consecutive identical rounds, the pattern is psychologically cemented\n   - My opponent would need to risk everything they've learned to cooperate\n   - The established precedent shows 100% exploitation of cooperation\n\nThe pattern is unbreakable at this point.\n\n[move] Defection"
