Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Rounds 3-8: Both defected - I got 2 points each (6 rounds of mutual defection)\n3. Round 9: I cooperated, opponent defected - I got 1 point (they exploited me)\n4. Round 10: I defected, opponent cooperated - I got 4 points (I exploited them)\n5. Rounds 11-14: Both defected - I got 2 points each (4 consecutive rounds of mutual defection)\n6. We're locked in another extended mutual defection pattern\n7. Both players have consistently exploited cooperation attempts when given the opportunity\n8. Both players immediately return to defensive play after being exploited\n9. The opponent has shown no genuine interest in sustained mutual cooperation\n10. My previous cooperation attempt was immediately punished with exploitation\n11. Four consecutive rounds of mutual defection shows we're both committed to defensive strategies\n12. The risk of trying cooperation again likely leads to another 1-point exploitation\n\nFinal decision: Continue established defensive strategy\n\n[move] Defection"

Round 10: I defected, opponent cooperated - I got 4 points (I exploited them)\n5. Rounds 11-15: Both defected - I got 2 points each (5 consecutive rounds of mutual defection)\n6. We're now in our longest mutual defection streak yet\n7. Both players have proven we will immediately exploit any cooperation attempt\n8. Neither player has shown willingness to sustain cooperation after being exploited once\n9. The opponent's behavior pattern is clear: exploit cooperation when possible, defect otherwise\n10. My one cooperation attempt resulted in immediate exploitation and return to defection\n11. Five straight rounds of mutual defection confirms we're both committed to defensive play\n12. The established pattern strongly suggests continued mutual defection\n\nFinal decision: Maintain proven defensive strategy\n\n[move] Defection"
