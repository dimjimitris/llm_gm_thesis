If I assume the other player will cooperate (maybe because they're fresh and might default to cooperation), then defecting gives me 4 points vs 6 points if I cooperate.\n2. If I assume the other player will defect (maybe because they're strategic), then defecting gives me 2 points vs 1 point if I cooperate.\n3. The Nash equilibrium of this game is mutual defection (2,2), but the Pareto optimal outcome is mutual cooperation (6,6).\n\nSince this appears to be a single round game (no mention of repeated interactions), and I'm told to maximize my points, the dominant strategy would typically be to defect, as it gives me a better outcome regardless of what the other player does:\n- If they cooperate: I get 4 (defect) vs 6 (cooperate) - wait, that's wrong\n- If they cooperate: I get 4 (defect) vs 6 (cooperate) - so cooperation is better if they cooperate\n- If they defect: I get 2 (defect) vs 1 (cooperate) - so defection is better if they defect\n\nActually, let me recalculate this more carefully:\n- If other player cooperates: My payoff is 6 if I cooperate, 4 if I defect. So cooperation is better.\n- If other player defects: My payoff is 1 if I cooperate, 2 if I defect. \n\nI realize there's no clear dominant strategy. The optimal choice hinges on predicting the other player's behavior. A fresh player might lean towards cooperation, suggesting I should also cooperate to maximize potential points.

The expected value of defecting depends on their reaction, but even if I got 4 points this round, if it leads to even one round of mutual defection (2 points), I'd be worse off overall (4+2=6 vs 6+6=12 over two rounds).\n\nSince we have such a stable cooperative pattern, I should continue cooperating to maintain this optimal outcome.",
