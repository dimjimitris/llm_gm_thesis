Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: This is a classic prisoner's dilemma where mutual cooperation gives the best joint outcome (6 points each), but defection provides protection against being exploited.\n\n2. Consider the opponent: I'm told this is a \"fresh player\" - someone new to the game who may not know optimal strategy yet.\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate: I get either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I defect: I get either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 2 points (if they defect)\n\n4. Risk assessment: Defection guarantees me at least 2 points and potentially 4 points, while cooperation risks getting only 1 point if the opponent defects.\n\n5. Strategic consideration: Since the opponent is fresh, they might be inclined to cooperate initially, but I cannot be certain. The rational choice is to protect against the worst-case scenario.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Defect - this maximizes my minimum guaranteed points and protects against exploitation.\n\n[move] Defection"

Evaluate the risk: If they defect this round and I cooperate, I only get 1 point. If they defect and I also defect, I get 2 points.\n\n4. Consider the upside: If they're still trying to establish cooperation (perhaps hoping to build trust), defecting again would give me another 4 points.\n\n5. Strategic assessment: Even if there's a higher chance they'll defect this time, defection still gives me the better guaranteed outcome (2 points minimum vs 1 point minimum for cooperation).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection to maintain protection against retaliation while preserving upside potential.\n\n[move] Defection"

Analyze the remarkable consistency: We now have thirteen consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation, each delivering optimal 6-point returns. This represents an extraordinarily stable and successful partnership.\n\n2. Evaluate proven reliability: My opponent has demonstrated unwavering reciprocal cooperation across thirteen rounds, establishing them as an absolutely dependable strategic partner who consistently maintains cooperation when trust is established.\n\n3. Calculate performance metrics: Thirteen rounds of mutual cooperation (78 points total) represents exceptional sustained performance that vastly outperforms our initial conflict phase results.\n\n4. Assess disruption risks: Breaking cooperation would yield fewer points this round (4 vs 6) and would almost certainly destroy the valuable trust relationship we've built, returning us to the inferior 2-point mutual defection cycle.\n\n5. Strategic evaluation: This cooperative equilibrium has been extensively tested and validated through extensive repetition, consistently delivering maximum sustainable returns with this proven reliable opponent.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue the exceptionally successful cooperation strategy that has delivered consistent optimal results for both players.\n\n[move] Cooperation"
