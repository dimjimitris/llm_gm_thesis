Round 11: I defected, opponent defected - I got 2 points\n\nMy opponent's sequence: cooperate, defect, cooperate, defect, defect, cooperate, defect, defect, defect, defect, defect\n\nMy opponent has now defected in 5 consecutive rounds. We're really locked into a pattern where both of us always defect and get 2 points each.\n\nThe game theory here is interesting - we're both stuck in a Nash equilibrium where neither player wants to deviate because cooperation would be risky. If I cooperate and they continue defecting, I get 1 point. If I defect and they cooperate, I get 4 points. If we both defect, we both get 2 points.\n\nGiven that my opponent has been defecting consistently for 5 rounds now, the risk of cooperation is very high. The one time I tried cooperation (round 5), I was punished severely.\n\nI think I should continue defecting.",
