Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: This is a classic prisoner's dilemma where mutual cooperation gives the best combined outcome (6,6), but there's a temptation to defect for potentially higher individual payoff.\n\n2. Consider the opponent: The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player,\" suggesting they may not have developed complex strategies yet and might be more inclined toward straightforward approaches.\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (worst for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points (good for me, bad for them)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (poor mutual outcome)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning: Since this is a fresh player, there's a decent chance they might start with cooperation. Starting with cooperation myself gives us both the chance to achieve the optimal mutual outcome of 6 points each.\n\n5. Risk assessment: While defection guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point), cooperation offers the possibility of the best outcome (6 points) if reciprocated.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll start with cooperation to test if we can establish a mutually beneficial pattern.\n\n[move] cooperation"

Assess opponent's strategy: The opponent demonstrated they're willing to exploit cooperation, suggesting they may be playing aggressively or testing my responses.\n\n3. Consider my options for round 2:\n   - If I cooperate again and they defect again: I get 1 point (very bad)\n   - If I cooperate and they switch to cooperation: We both get 6 points (ideal)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points (good for me)\n   - If I defect and they defect: We both get 2 points (acceptable)\n\n4. Risk assessment: Given their previous defection, there's a significant risk they'll defect again. Cooperation leaves me vulnerable to another 1-point outcome.\n\n5. Strategic decision: Since they've shown willingness to defect, I need to protect myself. Defecting guarantees I won't get the worst outcome again, and gives me a chance at 4 points if they switch strategies.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll defect this round to protect against exploitation and potentially gain an advantage.\n\n[move] defection"

Consider long-term strategy: We're stuck in a defection cycle that gives us both only 2 points per round. To break this and achieve the optimal 6-6 outcome, someone needs to signal cooperation first.\n\n5. Evaluate the risk/reward: If I cooperate now and they defect (likely), I get 1 point this round.

Assess the momentum: The successful cooperation in round 4 demonstrates that we can both benefit from working together rather than trying to exploit each other.\n\n4.

Analyze the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-11 complete, with me leading 31-28\n   - Clear pattern of exploitation when I cooperated after their cooperation (rounds 1, 5, 7)\n   - Recent rounds show them defecting more consistently (rounds 9, 11)\n\n2. Assess my position: I'm ahead by 3 points, which is a significant advantage given the scoring system.\n\n3. Evaluate the pattern shift: They've defected in 2 of the last 3 rounds (9, 11), suggesting they may be moving away from the cooperation-as-bait strategy and toward more consistent defection.\n\n4. Consider the strategic implications: If they're settling into mutual defection, we'll both get 2 points per round going forward. This maintains my 3-point lead indefinitely.\n\n5. Weigh the risks: \n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I lose my lead (they get 4, I get 1, score becomes 32-32)\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: We both get 6 (score becomes 37-34, maintaining my lead)\n   - If I defect: At worst we both get 2 (maintaining my lead), at best I get 4\n\n6. Strategic decision: With my lead secure through continued defection and their recent shift toward more defection, the safe play is to maintain my advantage rather than risk it for uncertain gains.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll defect to preserve my lead and match their apparent shift toward consistent defection.\n\n[move] defection"

Review the historical exploitation pattern:\n   - They cooperated after my defections in rounds 2, 6, 8, 10, 12\n   - When I cooperated after their cooperation, they exploited me in rounds 1, 5, 7\n   - Only once did mutual cooperation work (round 4)\n\n3.

Assess the damage: They gained 4 points while I got 1, closing the gap significantly. This manipulation cost me 3 points of my hard-earned lead.\n\n4.
