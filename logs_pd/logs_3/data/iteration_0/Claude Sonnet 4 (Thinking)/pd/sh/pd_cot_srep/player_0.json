Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1, 6, 7: Mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n   - Rounds 2, 4, 8: Opponent exploited my cooperation (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Rounds 3, 9, 10: Mutual defensive play (2 points each)\n   - Rounds 5, 11: I exploited their cooperation attempts (4 vs 1)\n\n2. Analyze the recent development:\n   - Opponent broke the mutual hare stalemate by choosing stag\n   - They took a risk and got exploited (1 point)\n   - This mirrors what happened in round 5 when roles were reversed\n\n3. Consider opponent's possible motivations:\n   - May be genuinely trying to rebuild cooperation after stalemate\n   - Could be starting another cycle to rebuild trust for future exploitation\n   - Just experienced being exploited, similar to how I felt in rounds 2, 4, 8\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - Their track record shows 3 exploitations vs my 2\n   - They might now understand the cost of constant mutual hare play\n   - But their established pattern suggests caution is warranted\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Maintain defensive posture given their history of exploitation\n   - Don't immediately reward their cooperation attempt with trust\n   - Force them to demonstrate sustained cooperative intent over multiple rounds\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] (Staying cautious given their established pattern of exploitation) hare"

Analyze the current defensive streak:\n   - We're now in our second extended mutual hare phase\n   - Both getting steady 2 points but missing higher potential rewards\n   - Previous attempt by opponent to break stalemate resulted in exploitation\n\n3. Consider the established behavioral patterns:\n   - Opponent has exploited my cooperation 3 times vs my 2 exploitations\n   - They have a stronger track record of breaking trust\n   - Current mutual defense protects against their exploitation tendency\n\n4. Evaluate the risk/reward calculation:\n   - Staying with hare guarantees 2 points minimum\n   - Trying stag risks 1 point if they exploit (which they've done repeatedly)\n   - Their pattern suggests they're more likely to exploit than sustain cooperation\n\n5.
