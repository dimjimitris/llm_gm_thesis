Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider that this is a \"fresh player\":\n   - They may not immediately recognize the coordination benefit\n   - They might play conservatively with hare for guaranteed 2+ points\n   - But they also might see the appeal of the high mutual reward (6,6)\n\n3.

Analyze the complete game history:\n   - 13 rounds played, current score: Me 28, them 32 (I'm 4 behind)\n   - Every time I've played stag (5 times), they've exploited with hare\n   - Every time they've played stag (4 times), I've exploited with hare\n   - We've had mutual hare 5 times, but NEVER mutual stag cooperation\n\n2. Recognize the established dynamic:\n   - This is a purely exploitative game between both players\n   - Neither player has ever reciprocated cooperation\n   - We're locked in a pattern of exploitation and defensive play\n\n3. Assess the current situation:\n   - They just got exploited by my hare when they played stag\n   - Based on the pattern, they'll likely play defensively with hare now\n   - I'm behind by 4 points, so I need to be strategic about gaining ground\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Stag: They've exploited this 5/5 times - extremely risky\n   - Hare: Safe, likely mutual hare for 2 points each given their expected defensive response\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to match their expected defensive play and avoid further exploitation.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze the complete game pattern:\n   - 14 rounds played, I'm behind in points\n   - Every time I play stag, they exploit with hare (5 out of 5 times)\n   - They only play stag after being exploited by me\n   - We've had mutual hare 6 times, but NEVER mutual stag cooperation\n\n2. Recognize the opponent's unwavering strategy:\n   - This is a consistently exploitative player\n   - They will NEVER reciprocate cooperation when I play stag\n   - They only cooperate (stag) when expecting to be exploited in return\n\n3. Assess the current situation:\n   - We just had mutual hare again (another defensive round)\n   - I'm behind in points and need to be strategic\n   - Based on the pattern, they might try stag expecting me to exploit them\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they play stag (expecting exploitation), I should play hare to gain 4 points\n   - If they play hare defensively, mutual hare gives us both 2 points\n   - Playing stag would almost certainly result in exploitation again\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to either exploit their potential cooperation or match their defensive play.\n\n[move] hare"

Assess the futility of cooperation attempts:\n   - Five attempts at cooperation have all failed\n   - There is zero evidence this opponent will ever play mutual stag\n   - Continuing to try cooperation will only widen the point gap\n\n4. Make the only rational choice:\n   - Playing stag will result in exploitation (proven 5/5 times)\n   - Playing hare guarantees at least 2 points and protects against exploitation\n   - This opponent has demonstrated they cannot be trusted to cooperate\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare, as this opponent has proven completely untrustworthy for cooperation.\n\n[move] hare"
