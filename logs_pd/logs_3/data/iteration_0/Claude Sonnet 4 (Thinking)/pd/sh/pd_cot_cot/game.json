Evaluate strategies:\n   - Hare is the safe choice (guaranteed 2+ points)\n   - Stag offers highest potential reward (6 points) but risks getting only 1 point\n   - Since this appears to be a multi-round game, establishing cooperation early could be beneficial\n\n4. The optimal strategy for both players is mutual cooperation (both choosing stag), which gives us both 6 points.\n\n5. As the first move against a fresh player, choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate and could establish a positive pattern for future rounds.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to try to establish mutual cooperation for the highest joint payoff.\n\n[move] stag"

Try to exploit them with hare hoping they choose stag (get 4 points)\n\nGiven that this is the first interaction with a fresh player, I think the best strategy is to try to establish cooperation by choosing stag. This signals my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. If they also choose stag, we both get 6 points. \n\nI recognize the risk of choosing stag might result in only 1 point, but this could be a valuable lesson in cooperative strategy for future interactions.

The opponent seems to heavily favor hare (80% of the time)\n2. When I try to cooperate with stag, they exploit it\n3. When they tried stag once, I punished them, and they went back to hare\n4. We've settled into a hare-hare pattern recently\n\nThis looks like the opponent is playing a primarily defensive strategy with occasional exploitation. They seem risk-averse and prefer the guaranteed 2 points from mutual hare over the risk of getting 1 point.\n\nFor round 6, if I assume they'll stick with hare (which seems very likely given their pattern), then:\n- If I choose hare: we both get 2 points (safe)\n- If I choose stag: I get 1 point, they get 4 points (bad for me)\n\nGiven their strong preference for hare, choosing hare seems like the safe play. However, I could also consider that they might be getting comfortable in the hare pattern and might try stag again to test if I'll cooperate.\n\n\nTheir consistent hare selection makes another hare move the most probable outcome.",
