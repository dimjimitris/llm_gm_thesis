Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze my potential outcomes:\n   - If I choose Stag: I get either 6 points (if opponent chooses Stag) or 1 point (if opponent chooses Hare)\n   - If I choose Hare: I get either 4 points (if opponent chooses Stag) or 2 points (if opponent chooses Hare)\n\n2. Consider the risk vs reward:\n   - Stag is high-risk, high-reward: potential for maximum points (6) but also risk of minimum points (1)\n   - Hare provides more consistent returns: guaranteed at least 2 points, with potential for 4\n\n3. Evaluate opponent behavior:\n   - Playing against a \"fresh player\" suggests they may be inexperienced\n   - New players often choose safer, more conservative options\n   - They might be risk-averse and lean toward Hare\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If opponent chooses Hare (likely for a new player), I'm better off choosing Hare (2 points) than Stag (1 point)\n   - Hare gives me a floor of 2 points regardless of opponent's choice\n   - This minimizes my downside risk while still offering decent upside\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given the uncertainty about a fresh player's strategy and the need to avoid the worst-case scenario of only 1 point, I'll choose the more conservative approach.\n\n[move] Hare"

Consider breaking point psychology:\n   - Seven identical outcomes might create peak frustration\n   - Opponent might finally realize we're both sacrificing potential gains\n   - However, extreme repetition can also reinforce habitual behavior\n\n3. Evaluate opponent's risk profile:\n   - Seven consecutive Hare choices shows extreme risk aversion\n   - They've completely abandoned Stag after early bad experiences\n   - Pattern suggests they prioritize certainty over potential higher rewards\n\n4. Assess cooperation likelihood:\n   - True cooperation would require simultaneous Stag choices for 6-6 outcome\n   - Opponent's history shows opportunistic tendencies, not cooperative ones\n   - Seven-round commitment to Hare suggests they won't risk the 1-point penalty\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - Opponent has demonstrated maximum predictability with Hare strategy\n   - Breaking pattern with Stag risks catastrophic 1-point outcome\n   - Their behavioral consistency suggests they'll maintain current strategy\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has shown unprecedented consistency and risk aversion.
