Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both stag: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Both hare: 2 points each (safe outcome)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, they get 4 (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4, they get 1 (tempting defection)\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - They might be willing to cooperate since they haven't been disappointed yet\n   - They might choose the mutually beneficial option\n   - They likely haven't developed a cynical strategy yet\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 6 points (excellent)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (bad, but worth the risk)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 2 or 4 points, but miss the chance for 6\n\n4. The mutual cooperation outcome (both choosing stag) gives the highest payoff for both players. Since this is a fresh player, they may be more inclined toward cooperation.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag, betting on mutual cooperation for the best joint outcome.\n\n[move] stag"

Analyze what happened in the previous round:\n   - I chose stag (cooperation), opponent chose hare (defection)\n   - I got 1 point, they got 4 points\n   - This shows the opponent is willing to exploit cooperative moves\n\n2. Consider the opponent's likely strategy:\n   - They successfully defected once and got a high payoff\n   - They might expect me to be more defensive now\n   - They could try to defect again, or they might switch to stag expecting me to retaliate with hare\n\n3. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If I choose stag again and they choose hare: I get 1 point again (very bad)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: We both get 2 points (safe)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points (good payoff)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 6 points (risky given their behavior)\n\n4. The opponent has shown they're willing to defect, so choosing hare gives me either a safe outcome (2 points) or a profitable one (4 points), while avoiding the risk of getting only 1 point again.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare to protect myself from exploitation and potentially capitalize on their move.\n\n[move] hare"

Consider what the opponent's strategy might be:\n   - They cooperated in round 2 after defecting in round 1\n   - This could signal they want to return to cooperation\n   - Or they might be expecting me to defect again and plan to defect themselves\n\n3. Evaluate the current situation:\n   - We've both \"punished\" each other once\n   - The mutual punishment is complete - this could be a reset point\n   - If we can establish mutual cooperation (both choosing stag), we both get 6 points each round going forward\n\n4.
