The opponent chose Stag in the first round, which suggests they might be cooperative or trying to achieve the mutual best outcome (6-6).\n\n2. Since they got only 1 point while I got 4, they might:\n   - Be disappointed and switch to Hare next time\n   - Try Stag again thinking I might cooperate this time\n   - Be learning from the experience\n\n3. If they switch to Hare (thinking I'll choose Hare again), and I choose Stag, I would get 1 point and they'd get 4.\n\n4. If they stick with Stag (hoping for cooperation), and I choose Stag too, we both get 6 points.\n\n5. If they stick with Stag and I choose Hare again, I get 4 points again.\n\n6. If they switch to Hare and I also choose Hare, we both get 2 points.\n\nThe key question is: what will they do after getting burned by choosing Stag?\n\nMany players would switch to the safer Hare option after getting exploited. But some might double down on Stag hoping for cooperation.\n\nGiven that I got 4 points last round by choosing Hare against their Stag, there's a good chance they learned that Stag can be risky against an unknown opponent. They might switch to Hare.\n\nIf I think they'll choose Hare, then I should choose Stag to get 1 point (not great) or Hare to get 2 points (safer).\n\nActually wait, let me double-check the payoff matrix:\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n\n\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nI'm weighing the potential outcomes carefully. The strategic complexity is increasing as I try to predict my opponent's next move. Each choice carries different risks and potential rewards.\n\nAnticipating their strategy might involve a calculated gamble between cooperation and self-interest.

However, I should also consider whether there might be any strategic reason to occasionally test or exploit this pattern\n\nGiven that this opponent has shown such unwavering commitment to cooperation, continuing with Stag seems to be the optimal choice. Breaking the pattern would give me only 4 points instead of 6, which is mathematically inferior.\n\nThe opponent's behavior suggests they are either:\n- Playing a pure cooperative strategy\n- Committed to maintaining mutual benefit\n- Possibly testing my own commitment to cooperation\n\nIn any case, continuing cooperation maintains the optimal outcome for both players.",
