Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix: Stag-Stag gives us both 6 points (best mutual outcome), but if I choose Stag and opponent chooses Hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\n2. Consider the opponent: They're described as a \"fresh player\" which suggests inexperience and unpredictability.\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward: \n   - Choosing Stag: potential for 6 points but risk of only 1 point\n   - Choosing Hare: guaranteed minimum of 2 points with potential for 4 points\n\n4. Fresh players often choose safer options when uncertain about strategy, making Hare more likely.\n\n5.

Consider opponent's mindset: They tried the cooperative/risky move (Stag) and got burned. They might either:\n   - Switch to safer Hare after getting exploited\n   - Try Stag again hoping for mutual cooperation this time\n\n3. Evaluate the psychology: Since they chose Stag initially (the trusting/cooperative move), they might be the type of player who believes in mutual benefit and could try Stag again.\n\n4. Risk assessment: If they choose Stag again and I choose Stag, we both get 6 points (excellent outcome). If they switched to Hare and I choose Stag, I get 1 point (poor but manageable).\n\n5.
