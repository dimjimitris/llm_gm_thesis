Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoffs:\n   - Mutual stag: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Mutual hare: 2 points each (safe mutual outcome)\n   - Stag vs hare: 1 point for stag player, 4 for hare player\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - They may not understand the coordination aspect fully\n   - They might lean toward the safer hare option (guarantees at least 2 points)\n   - They could choose randomly without much strategy\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (excellent)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (poor)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (good)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (acceptable)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Stag is high-risk, high-reward\n   - Hare provides better guaranteed minimum (2 vs 1) with upside potential\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player who may not fully grasp the coordination dynamics, I think they're more likely to choose the safer hare option.\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare for better risk management against an unpredictable new player.\n\n[move] hare"

Assess the extraordinary consistency:\n   - They've chosen hare for 9 consecutive rounds now\n   - This represents extreme commitment to the safe strategy\n   - Their risk aversion appears absolute after early stag failures\n\n3. Consider the theoretical coordination opportunity:\n   - After 9 mutual hare rounds, there might be a tiny chance for stag coordination\n   - However, their pattern shows zero willingness to risk the 1-point outcome\n   - The 9-round streak indicates they're locked into safety-first thinking\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic calculus:\n   - Continuing hare: Guaranteed 2 points, maintaining strong 2.33 average\n   - Switching to stag: Extremely high risk of 1 point given their entrenched behavior\n   - Their 9-round hare commitment shows no signs of wavering\n\nThe opponent's 9-round hare streak demonstrates such profound risk aversion that attempting coordination would almost certainly backfire.\n\nFinal decision: Stay with the proven reliable strategy.\n\n[move] hare"
