When I play hare, sometimes they play hare (mutual 2 points) and sometimes they play stag (giving me 4 points while they get 1).\n\nGiven that they just played stag and I got 4 points, and looking at their pattern, they might go back to hare. If I choose hare and they choose hare, we both get 2. If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4. If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1.

Predict opponent's next move:\n   - They might expect me to go defensive after being exploited\n   - They could try cooperation now that we're \"even\" on exploitation\n   - They might continue exploiting if they think I'll keep trying stag\n\n4.

The mutual hare equilibrium is very stable. However, I should consider if this long streak of mutual hare might eventually prompt one of us to try breaking out for the higher mutual payoff of stag-stag (6 points each vs 2 points each).\n\nThe opponent has shown they're strategic - they exploited my cooperation attempts consistently. But after this many rounds of 2-2, they might be thinking about the potential for 6-6 if we could both cooperate.\n\nHowever, the risk is still that if I choose stag and they choose hare, I get only 1 point while they get 4. \n\nTheir past behavior of consistently exploiting cooperation makes the risk too high. I'll stick with the safe strategy of choosing hare, maintaining the established pattern and protecting myself from potential manipulation.",
