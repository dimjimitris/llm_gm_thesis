Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "Let me analyze this round step-by-step:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Major development: After 12 consecutive rounds of both players choosing hare, the opponent switched to stag in round 13.\n\n2. Result analysis:\n   - I chose hare and scored 6 points (maximum possible)\n   - Opponent chose stag and scored 1 point (minimum possible)\n   - This broke the established pattern dramatically\n\n3. Consider opponent's potential motivations for switching:\n   - Attempting to establish mutual cooperation (both choosing stag for 4 points each)\n   - Testing whether I'll reciprocate with stag\n   - Trying to break the 2-2 point stalemate\n   - Possible strategic error\n\n4. Analyze my options for this round:\n   - If opponent chooses stag again: my hare=6 points, my stag=4 points\n   - If opponent returns to hare: my hare=2 points, my stag=1 point\n   - Hare gives me better outcomes in both scenarios\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic implications:\n   - Hare remains the dominant strategy regardless of opponent's switch\n   - Even if opponent is attempting cooperation, hare maximizes my points\n   - The opponent's costly experiment (1 point vs 2) may discourage future stag choices\n\n6. The opponent's switch doesn't change the fundamental game theory - hare still dominates.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maintain optimal strategy, as it provides maximum points regardless of opponent's next move.\n\n[move] hare"

Pattern analysis: After the opponent's brief experiment with stag in round 13 (where they scored only 1 point), they immediately returned to hare in round 14.\n\n2. Opponent's learning process:\n   - They tested stag once and received the worst possible outcome (1 point)\n   - I received the best possible outcome (6 points) for staying with hare\n   - They quickly reverted to hare, suggesting they learned from the costly experiment\n\n3. Current strategic landscape:\n   - The opponent appears to have confirmed that deviating from hare is costly\n   - Their quick return to hare suggests they understand the dominant strategy\n   - The brief deviation may have reinforced their commitment to hare going forward\n\n4. Apply game theory fundamentals:\n   - Hare remains mathematically dominant regardless of the opponent's recent experimentation\n   - The payoff matrix is unchanged: hare provides superior outcomes against any opponent choice\n   - Each round is an independent decision point\n\n5. Evaluate expected outcomes:\n   - If opponent sticks with hare (highly likely after their costly experiment): my hare=2 points, my stag=1 point\n   - If opponent tries stag again (unlikely after losing): my hare=6 points, my stag=4 points\n   - Hare provides better expected value in both scenarios\n\n6. The opponent's failed experiment reinforces the wisdom of the dominant strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maintain the mathematically optimal strategy, especially given the opponent's demonstrated learning from their costly deviation.\n\n[move] hare"

Current pattern: After the opponent's stag experiment in round 13 (resulting in 1 point), they've returned to hare for two consecutive rounds (14-15).\n\n2. Opponent's behavioral learning:\n   - They experienced the cost of deviating from hare (1 point vs potential 2)\n   - I demonstrated the benefit of staying with hare (6 points when they chose stag)\n   - Their immediate return to hare suggests they learned from the experiment\n\n3. Strategic assessment:\n   - The opponent appears to have confirmed that hare is the safer, more reliable choice\n   - Their pattern suggests they're unlikely to experiment with stag again soon\n   - The brief deviation reinforced rather than undermined the dominant strategy\n\n4. Apply core game theory:\n   - Hare continues to be mathematically dominant independent of opponent's learning process\n   - The payoff structure remains constant: hare yields better outcomes against any opponent choice\n   - Each round represents an independent strategic decision\n\n5. Calculate expected outcomes:\n   - If opponent maintains hare (probable): my hare=2 points, my stag=1 point\n   - If opponent tries stag again (improbable): my hare=6 points, my stag=4 points\n   - Expected value strongly favors hare selection\n\n6.
