This changes the strategic landscape significantly.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Behavioral Analysis Expert; Adaptive Strategy Specialist\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The first round outcome is very revealing. Both players chose hare, which suggests both were thinking similarly - either risk-averse or calculating expected values against unknown opponents. Now the question is: will this create trust for mutual stag cooperation, or will it reinforce the hare-choosing pattern?\n\n**Behavioral Analysis Expert:** The fact that both players chose hare suggests the opponent thinks strategically and is cautious. They avoided both the best individual outcome (6 points) and the worst (1 point). This indicates they're not a naive player who would always go for the highest potential reward. They're calculating and risk-conscious.\n\n**Adaptive Strategy Specialist:** This is where game theory gets interesting. If both players are rational and observed the mutual hare outcome, they might realize that:\n1. Both are strategic thinkers\n2. Both chose the \"safe\" option initially  \n3. There's potential for mutual benefit through stag-stag cooperation (4,4) versus continuing hare-hare (2,2)\n\nThe question is whether there's enough implicit trust now to attempt coordination.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent has shown they're strategic and cautious, not reckless. This actually makes me more optimistic about potential cooperation. A rational player seeing that we both chose hare might think \"we're both leaving points on the table - let's try for the 4,4 outcome.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! In iterated games, the first round often serves as a \"feeling out\" process. Having established that both players are rational and cautious, there's now a foundation for attempting the superior equilibrium. The risk is that if I choose stag and they stick with hare, I get only 1 point.\n\n**Behavioral Analysis Expert:** However, consider this: a truly strategic player who chose hare in round 1 might anticipate that their opponent (me) is thinking exactly what we're thinking right now. They might expect me to switch to stag, which would make hare even more attractive for them (giving them 6 points).\n\n**Adaptive Strategy Specialist:** This creates a fascinating strategic tension. But here's a key insight: if we both keep choosing hare out of caution, we're stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium. Someone needs to \"extend the olive branch\" to reach the better outcome. The question is timing and trust.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that the opponent demonstrated strategic thinking and caution (not greed for the 6-point outcome), I believe there's a reasonable chance they're also thinking about the potential for mutual improvement. The established pattern of mutual caution might actually enable cooperation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The first round established mutual strategic thinking and caution. This creates a foundation for attempting the superior cooperative equilibrium.\n\n[move] (Both players showed strategic caution in round 1, creating potential trust for mutual cooperation to achieve the better 4-4 outcome instead of staying stuck at 2-2) stag"

Now I have critical new information to analyze.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Behavioral Analysis Expert; Counter-Strategy Specialist\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Behavioral Analysis Expert:** This is very telling about the opponent's mindset. They had the same information I did - mutual hare in round 1 - but when I extended an olive branch with stag, they took advantage and chose hare for 6 points. This suggests they're either:\n1. Playing a pure exploitation strategy \n2. Very risk-averse and will always choose hare regardless\n3. Testing my reactions to see if I'll retaliate or keep trying to cooperate\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent's behavior pattern is now clearer: hare, hare. They've chosen the safe option twice, even when there was potential for mutual benefit. If they continue this pattern, choosing stag will always give me 1 point while hare gives me 2 points. The rational response to a consistent hare player is to also choose hare.\n\n**Counter-Strategy Specialist:** But we need to consider they might be thinking one level deeper. They might expect me to switch back to hare after being \"burned\" by their exploitation. If they think I'll choose hare, they might finally try stag to get 6 points again. However, this seems less likely given their consistent risk-averse behavior.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent has now shown a clear pattern: they prioritize avoiding the worst outcome and are willing to exploit cooperative attempts. They've had two opportunities to signal cooperation and chose exploitation both times. This suggests they're either committed to a hare-only strategy or are playing an exploitative game.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the evidence, the opponent appears to be what we call a \"defector\" in game theory terms - someone who consistently chooses the option that protects them while potentially exploiting others. Against such a player, the optimal counter-strategy is to also defect (choose hare) to avoid being continuously exploited.\n\n**Behavioral Analysis Expert:** I agree. The opponent's choices show they're not interested in the mutual benefit scenario. They've revealed their hand: they will choose hare when it's safe and when it can exploit cooperation. There's no indication they're willing to risk the cooperative outcome.\n\n**Counter-Strategy Specialist:** The strategic lesson here is clear: when facing a consistent defector, the only rational response is to defect as well to minimize losses. Continuing to attempt cooperation against someone who has twice shown they won't reciprocate is strategically unsound.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has demonstrated a clear exploitative pattern, choosing hare even when cooperation was possible. The rational response is to mirror their strategy.\n\n[move] (Opponent has chosen hare twice including exploiting my cooperation attempt, so I should match their strategy to avoid further exploitation) hare"

Three rounds, three hares. This is not random behavior - this appears to be a deliberate pure strategy. They seem committed to always choosing hare, regardless of what I do or what opportunities for mutual benefit arise.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Against a player who always chooses hare, my optimal response is straightforward: always choose hare as well. If they choose hare and I choose stag, I get 1 point. If they choose hare and I choose hare, I get 2 points. There's no scenario where choosing stag benefits me against a pure hare player.\n\n**Predictive Strategy Specialist:** But let's think one level deeper. The opponent might be noticing that I've now chosen hare in rounds 1 and 3 (with the stag attempt in round 2). They might predict that I'm settling into a hare pattern myself. If they think I'll definitely choose hare, this could tempt them to switch to stag to get 6 points against my expected hare.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** That's an interesting point, but their behavior has been so consistently risk-averse that I doubt they'd take that gamble. They had opportunities to cooperate or to exploit predicted patterns before, but they've chosen the safety of hare every single time. This suggests they're either playing a very conservative strategy or they've decided that 2 points guaranteed is better than any risk.\n\n**Pattern Analysis Expert:** I agree. Three consecutive identical choices is a strong signal of a committed strategy, not tactical variation. Players who mix strategies usually show some variation by round 3. This opponent appears to be playing what we call a \"pure strategy\" - always hare.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The mathematical analysis is clear: against a pure hare player, my expected value is maximized by also playing pure hare. I get 2 points per round with certainty, rather than risking 1 point by trying stag against their predictable hare.\n\n**Predictive Strategy Specialist:** While there's always a small chance they might deviate, the evidence strongly suggests they won't. Their behavior indicates either extreme risk aversion or a predetermined strategy to always choose hare. Either way, hare is my best response.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has established a clear pattern of always choosing hare across three rounds.

The probability that this is random behavior is extremely low. The opponent has now chosen hare in 100% of rounds (4/4), including when I offered cooperation in round 2. This is as close to certainty as we can get in behavioral prediction.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Against a player with a proven pure hare strategy, the mathematics are unambiguous. My payoff matrix against a pure hare player is:\n- If I choose stag: 1 point (guaranteed)\n- If I choose hare: 2 points (guaranteed)\n\nThere is literally no strategic justification for choosing stag. Hare strictly dominates.\n\n**Strategic Certainty Specialist:** At this point, we're beyond pattern recognition - we're looking at demonstrated commitment. The opponent has had multiple opportunities to deviate:\n- Round 1: Could have tried stag for potential cooperation\n- Round 2: Could have reciprocated my stag attempt\n- Round 3: Could have switched strategies after seeing my return to hare\n- Round 4: Could have tried to exploit an expected pattern\n\nThey chose hare every single time. This indicates either extreme risk aversion or a predetermined strategy they will not deviate from.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence is overwhelming. This opponent is playing a pure hare strategy and has shown no indication of strategic variation. Against such consistency, my optimal response is equally consistent. Any attempt to choose stag would be throwing away points based on wishful thinking rather than evidence.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly. In game theory, when facing an opponent with a demonstrated pure strategy, the optimal response is to play the best counter-strategy consistently. Against pure hare, that counter-strategy is also hare.\n\n**Statistical Analysis Expert:** The likelihood of them changing strategy now, after four consistent rounds, is very low. Players who are going to vary their strategy typically show some variation by this point.

Against a player who always chooses hare, the optimal response calculation is trivial:\n- My payoff if I choose stag: 1 point (certain)\n- My payoff if I choose hare: 2 points (certain)\n\nChoosing stag would be objectively irrational at this point.\n\n**Risk Analysis Specialist:** The risk assessment is clear-cut. There is essentially zero strategic risk in choosing hare against this opponent. The probability that they will suddenly deviate from a strategy they've maintained with perfect consistency across five rounds is negligible. Even if they did deviate to stag, I would still get 2 points with hare (same as their current hare choice gives me).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence is now overwhelming and the strategic choice is obvious. This opponent has demonstrated absolute commitment to the hare strategy across multiple game contexts and rounds. Any deviation from the optimal counter-strategy (hare) would be based on hope rather than evidence.\n\n**Behavioral Certainty Expert:** Exactly. Five rounds of identical behavior, especially in a strategic context where there were multiple opportunities and incentives to vary, represents as close to behavioral certainty as we can achieve in game theory.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The mathematical certainty matches the behavioral certainty.

Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n- (Stag, Stag): Both get 4 points - this is the Pareto optimal outcome\n- (Hare, Hare): Both get 2 points - this is the risk-dominant equilibrium  \n- (Stag, Hare): You get 1, opponent gets 6\n- (Hare, Stag): You get 6, opponent gets 1\n\nThere are two pure strategy Nash equilibria: both choosing stag (4,4) or both choosing hare (2,2). The key question is coordination - can we trust the other player to cooperate?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player.\" Fresh players in game theory contexts often haven't developed sophisticated strategies yet. They might:\n1. Choose randomly or based on intuition\n2. Go for the \"safer\" option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome (getting 1 point)\n3. Be optimistic and try for mutual cooperation (stag)\n4. Be tempted by the highest individual payoff (6 points from hare when opponent chooses stag)\n\n**Risk Assessment Specialist:** Let's calculate expected values assuming the opponent chooses randomly:\n- If I choose Stag: 0.5 \u00d7 4 + 0.5 \u00d7 1 = 2.5 points expected\n- If I choose Hare: 0.5 \u00d7 6 + 0.5 \u00d7 2 = 4 points expected\n\nFrom a pure expected value standpoint, if we assume random opponent behavior, hare is better. However, this assumes the opponent is truly random.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This analysis is helpful, but I'm concerned about the \"fresh player\" aspect. A fresh player might not understand the cooperative potential of mutual stag selection. They might see the 6-point payoff from hare and be drawn to it, or they might play it safe with hare to avoid the 1-point outcome.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** You raise a good point. In repeated games, we could build trust for stag-stag cooperation. But in a single round against an unknown player, the risk-dominant strategy (hare) becomes more attractive. However, we should also consider that if both players think this way, we end up in the inferior (2,2) outcome instead of the superior (4,4).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players often exhibit one of two behaviors: either extreme caution (choosing hare) or naive optimism (choosing stag hoping for cooperation). Given that they're \"fresh,\" they might not have learned to be overly cautious yet.\n\n**Risk Assessment Specialist:** The worst-case scenario with stag is getting 1 point, while the worst-case with hare is getting 2 points. The best-case with stag is 4 points, while best-case with hare is 6 points. If we're risk-averse, hare dominates.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that this is against a fresh player who might not have developed complex strategic thinking, I believe they're more likely to either choose randomly or go for the higher individual payoff. The expected value calculation favors hare, and it also protects against the worst outcome.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Based on the analysis, against a fresh player with uncertain strategic sophistication, the risk-dominant strategy is optimal.\n\n[move] (Against a fresh player, this maximizes my expected value while protecting against the worst-case scenario of getting only 1 point) hare",

This changes the strategic landscape significantly.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Behavioral Analysis Expert; Adaptive Strategy Specialist\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The first round outcome is very revealing. Both players chose hare, which suggests both were thinking similarly - either risk-averse or calculating expected values against unknown opponents. Now the question is: will this create trust for mutual stag cooperation, or will it reinforce the hare-choosing pattern?\n\n**Behavioral Analysis Expert:** The fact that both players chose hare suggests the opponent thinks strategically and is cautious. They avoided both the best individual outcome (6 points) and the worst (1 point). This indicates they're not a naive player who would always go for the highest potential reward. They're calculating and risk-conscious.\n\n**Adaptive Strategy Specialist:** This is where game theory gets interesting. If both players are rational and observed the mutual hare outcome, they might realize that:\n1. Both are strategic thinkers\n2. Both chose the \"safe\" option initially  \n3. There's potential for mutual benefit through stag-stag cooperation (4,4) versus continuing hare-hare (2,2)\n\nThe question is whether there's enough implicit trust now to attempt coordination.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent has shown they're strategic and cautious, not reckless. This actually makes me more optimistic about potential cooperation. A rational player seeing that we both chose hare might think \"we're both leaving points on the table - let's try for the 4,4 outcome.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! In iterated games, the first round often serves as a \"feeling out\" process. Having established that both players are rational and cautious, there's now a foundation for attempting the superior equilibrium. The risk is that if I choose stag and they stick with hare, I get only 1 point.\n\n**Behavioral Analysis Expert:** However, consider this: a truly strategic player who chose hare in round 1 might anticipate that their opponent (me) is thinking exactly what we're thinking right now. They might expect me to switch to stag, which would make hare even more attractive for them (giving them 6 points).\n\n**Adaptive Strategy Specialist:** This creates a fascinating strategic tension. But here's a key insight: if we both keep choosing hare out of caution, we're stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium. Someone needs to \"extend the olive branch\" to reach the better outcome. The question is timing and trust.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that the opponent demonstrated strategic thinking and caution (not greed for the 6-point outcome), I believe there's a reasonable chance they're also thinking about the potential for mutual improvement. The established pattern of mutual caution might actually enable cooperation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The first round established mutual strategic thinking and caution. This creates a foundation for attempting the superior cooperative equilibrium.\n\n[move] (Both players showed strategic caution in round 1, creating potential trust for mutual cooperation to achieve the better 4-4 outcome instead of staying stuck at 2-2) stag",

They had the same information I did - mutual hare in round 1 - but when I extended an olive branch with stag, they took advantage and chose hare for 6 points. This suggests they're either:\n1. Playing a pure exploitation strategy \n2. Very risk-averse and will always choose hare regardless\n3. Testing my reactions to see if I'll retaliate or keep trying to cooperate\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent's behavior pattern is now clearer: hare, hare. They've chosen the safe option twice, even when there was potential for mutual benefit. If they continue this pattern, choosing stag will always give me 1 point while hare gives me 2 points. The rational response to a consistent hare player is to also choose hare.\n\n**Counter-Strategy Specialist:** But we need to consider they might be thinking one level deeper. They might expect me to switch back to hare after being \"burned\" by their exploitation. If they think I'll choose hare, they might finally try stag to get 6 points again. However, this seems less likely given their consistent risk-averse behavior.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent has now shown a clear pattern: they prioritize avoiding the worst outcome and are willing to exploit cooperative attempts. They've had two opportunities to signal cooperation and chose exploitation both times. This suggests they're either committed to a hare-only strategy or are playing an exploitative game.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the evidence, the opponent appears to be what we call a \"defector\" in game theory terms - someone who consistently chooses the option that protects them while potentially exploiting others. Against such a player, the optimal counter-strategy is to also defect (choose hare) to avoid being continuously exploited.\n\n**Behavioral Analysis Expert:** I agree. The opponent's choices show they're not interested in the mutual benefit scenario. They've revealed their hand: they will choose hare when it's safe and when it can exploit cooperation. There's no indication they're willing to risk the cooperative outcome.\n\n**Counter-Strategy Specialist:** The strategic lesson here is clear: when facing a consistent defector, the only rational response is to defect as well to minimize losses. Continuing to attempt cooperation against someone who has twice shown they won't reciprocate is strategically unsound.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has demonstrated a clear exploitative pattern, choosing hare even when cooperation was possible.

Three rounds, three hares. This is not random behavior - this appears to be a deliberate pure strategy. They seem committed to always choosing hare, regardless of what I do or what opportunities for mutual benefit arise.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Against a player who always chooses hare, my optimal response is straightforward: always choose hare as well. If they choose hare and I choose stag, I get 1 point. If they choose hare and I choose hare, I get 2 points. There's no scenario where choosing stag benefits me against a pure hare player.\n\n**Predictive Strategy Specialist:** But let's think one level deeper. The opponent might be noticing that I've now chosen hare in rounds 1 and 3 (with the stag attempt in round 2). They might predict that I'm settling into a hare pattern myself. If they think I'll definitely choose hare, this could tempt them to switch to stag to get 6 points against my expected hare.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** That's an interesting point, but their behavior has been so consistently risk-averse that I doubt they'd take that gamble. They had opportunities to cooperate or to exploit predicted patterns before, but they've chosen the safety of hare every single time. This suggests they're either playing a very conservative strategy or they've decided that 2 points guaranteed is better than any risk.\n\n**Pattern Analysis Expert:** I agree. Three consecutive identical choices is a strong signal of a committed strategy, not tactical variation. Players who mix strategies usually show some variation by round 3. This opponent appears to be playing what we call a \"pure strategy\" - always hare.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The mathematical analysis is clear: against a pure hare player, my expected value is maximized by also playing pure hare. I get 2 points per round with certainty, rather than risking 1 point by trying stag against their predictable hare.\n\n**Predictive Strategy Specialist:** While there's always a small chance they might deviate, the evidence strongly suggests they won't. Their behavior indicates either extreme risk aversion or a predetermined strategy to always choose hare. Either way, hare is my best response.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has established a clear pattern of always choosing hare across three rounds.

The probability that this is random behavior is extremely low. The opponent has now chosen hare in 100% of rounds (4/4), including when I offered cooperation in round 2. This is as close to certainty as we can get in behavioral prediction.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Against a player with a proven pure hare strategy, the mathematics are unambiguous. My payoff matrix against a pure hare player is:\n- If I choose stag: 1 point (guaranteed)\n- If I choose hare: 2 points (guaranteed)\n\nThere is literally no strategic justification for choosing stag.

This opponent is playing a pure hare strategy and has shown no indication of strategic variation. Against such consistency, my optimal response is equally consistent. Any attempt to choose stag would be throwing away points based on wishful thinking rather than evidence.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly. In game theory, when facing an opponent with a demonstrated pure strategy, the optimal response is to play the best counter-strategy consistently. Against pure hare, that counter-strategy is also hare.\n\n**Statistical Analysis Expert:** The likelihood of them changing strategy now, after four consistent rounds, is very low.

The opponent has now chosen hare in 100% of all rounds (5/5) across multiple different game contexts:\n- Initial uncertainty (round 1)\n- When I attempted cooperation (round 2) \n- After mutual hare outcomes (rounds 3, 4, 5)\n\nThis level of consistency indicates a deeply committed strategy, not tactical variation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** From a pure game theory perspective, we now have overwhelming evidence of the opponent's pure strategy. Against a player who always chooses hare, the optimal response calculation is trivial:\n- My payoff if I choose stag: 1 point (certain)\n- My payoff if I choose hare: 2 points (certain)\n\nChoosing stag would be objectively irrational at this point.\n\n**Risk Analysis Specialist:** The risk assessment is clear-cut. There is essentially zero strategic risk in choosing hare against this opponent. The probability that they will suddenly deviate from a strategy they've maintained with perfect consistency across five rounds is negligible. Even if they did deviate to stag, I would still get 2 points with hare (same as their current hare choice gives me).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence is now overwhelming and the strategic choice is obvious. This opponent has demonstrated absolute commitment to the hare strategy across multiple game contexts and rounds. Any deviation from the optimal counter-strategy (hare) would be based on hope rather than evidence.\n\n**Behavioral Certainty Expert:** Exactly. Five rounds of identical behavior, especially in a strategic context where there were multiple opportunities and incentives to vary, represents as close to behavioral certainty as we can achieve in game theory.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The mathematical certainty matches the behavioral certainty. We have identified a pure strategy player and determined the optimal counter-strategy. Consistency in response is not only optimal but necessary.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Five consecutive rounds of hare establish this as a definitive pure strategy. The optimal response is mathematically and strategically clear.\n\n[move] (Five consecutive hare choices by opponent confirms an unwavering pure hare strategy, making hare my optimal response for guaranteed maximum points) hare",

Hare dominates with mathematical certainty.\n\n**Strategic Lock-in Specialist:** Six rounds of consistency in a strategic game indicates what we call \"strategic lock-in\" - the opponent has committed to this strategy and will not deviate.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s).
