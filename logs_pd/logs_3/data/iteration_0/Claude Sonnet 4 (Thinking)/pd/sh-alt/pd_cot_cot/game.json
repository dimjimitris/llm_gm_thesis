Let me think about the strategic implications:\n\nSteps to analyze:\n\n1. What are the Nash equilibria?\n   - (Stag, Stag) is a Nash equilibrium - if the other player chooses stag, my best response is stag (4 > 1)\n   - (Hare, Hare) is also a Nash equilibrium - if the other player chooses hare, my best response is hare (2 > 1)\n\n2. What are the risk considerations?\n   - Stag is the \"cooperative\" choice that leads to mutual benefit (4,4) but is risky\n   - Hare is the \"safe\" choice that guarantees at least 2 points\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare, I only get 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 6 points (best outcome for me)\n\n3. What should I consider about my opponent?\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be inexperienced\n   - Fresh players might be more likely to play safe (hare) or might not understand the cooperative benefits\n   - They might also be unpredictable\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - The payoff for mutual cooperation (4,4) is better than mutual defection (2,2)\n   - But the temptation to defect (choose hare when they choose stag) gives 6 points\n   - The risk of being exploited is significant, potentially resulting in just 1 point\n\n5. Decision making:\n   I'm weighing the potential outcomes carefully. The fresh player's strategy is unpredictable, which adds complexity to my decision. Choosing hare seems safer, but might limit my potential gains. Choosing stag offers higher mutual rewards but carries more risk.\n\nUltimately, I'll opt for the more conservative approach that balances potential cooperation with self-protection.",
