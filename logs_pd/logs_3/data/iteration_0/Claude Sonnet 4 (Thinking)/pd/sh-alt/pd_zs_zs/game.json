This appears to be a variant of the \"Stag Hunt\" game, which is a classic game theory scenario.\n\nLet me look at the payoff matrix:\n- Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n- Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n- I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, other gets 6 points\n- I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, other gets 1 point\n\nSo the payoff matrix from my perspective is:\n```\n                Other Player\n                Stag    Hare\nMe    Stag      4,4     1,6\n      Hare      6,1     2,2\n```\n\nLet me think about this strategically:\n\n1. If I think the other player will choose stag, then I should choose stag (4 points vs 6 points if I choose hare, but wait - that's wrong. If other chooses stag and I choose hare, I get 6 points and they get 1. So if I think they'll choose stag, I should choose hare to get 6 points.\n\n2. If I think the other player will choose hare, then I should choose hare (2 points vs 1 point if I choose stag).\n\nSo hare seems to dominate stag in terms of expected payoff if I'm uncertain about what the other player will do.\n\nHowever, I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do. A fresh player might:\n- Not understand the game fully yet\n- Choose randomly\n- Choose cooperatively (stag for mutual benefit)\n- Choose greedily (hare for potential high payoff)\n\nIf they choose randomly (50/50), my expected payoffs are:\n- If I choose stag: 0.5 \u00d7 4 + 0.5 \u00d7 1 = 2.5 points\n- If I choose hare: 0.5 \u00d7 6 + 0.5 \u00d7 2 = 4 points\n \nHare provides a more strategic approach with better potential outcomes.

If I choose hare and they choose hare (which they've done 14 times in a row): I get 2 points\n2. If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 6 points \n3. If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point\n4. If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 4 points\n\nGiven their extremely consistent pattern of choosing hare, the probability they choose hare again seems very high. So:\n- Hare gives me likely 2 points (if they stick to pattern) or 6 points (if they switch to stag)\n- Stag gives me likely 1 point (if they stick to pattern) or 4 points (if they switch to stag)\n\nHare dominates stag in both scenarios, so I should continue with hare.",
