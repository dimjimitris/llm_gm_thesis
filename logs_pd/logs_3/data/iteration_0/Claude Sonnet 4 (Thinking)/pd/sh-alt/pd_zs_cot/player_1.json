Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider how this affects the opponent's likely strategy:\n   - They were burned by trusting/cooperating in round 1\n   - They now know I'm willing to choose hare for higher rewards\n   - They're likely to be more defensive and consider choosing hare themselves\n\n3. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If opponent switches to hare (likely): Hare vs Hare = 2 points each\n   - If opponent sticks with stag (less likely): Hare vs Stag = 6 points for me again\n   - If I switch to stag and opponent chooses hare: Stag vs Hare = 1 point for me\n   - If I switch to stag and opponent sticks with stag: Stag vs Stag = 4 points each\n\n4.

Consider the overwhelming predictability:\n   - 11-round defensive streak makes opponent's strategy virtually certain\n   - They clearly prioritize avoiding any risk over potential reward maximization\n   - Zero behavioral evidence suggests they'll ever attempt cooperative play\n\n4. Evaluate my options with near-mathematical certainty:\n   - Hare vs virtually-guaranteed hare: 2 points (extremely safe given 11-round precedent)\n   - Stag vs almost-certain hare: 1 point (extremely risky given overwhelming pattern)\n   - The defensive equilibrium is completely solidified\n\n5. Strategic decision: Continue hare because opponent's 11-round defensive commitment represents an absolutely unbreakable pattern - they've proven they'll permanently accept low rewards rather than risk any exploitation\n\n[move] hare"
