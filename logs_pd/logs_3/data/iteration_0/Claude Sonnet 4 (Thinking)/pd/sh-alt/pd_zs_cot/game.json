Their behavior is extremely predictable at this point\n4. They clearly prioritize avoiding the 1-point outcome over achieving the 4-point outcome\n\nHowever, I should also consider that this extreme pattern might suggest the opponent is also stuck in the same reasoning loop I am - they might be thinking the same thing about me. But given that they were the one who was initially exploited (they chose stag in round 1 and got 1 point while I got 6), their defensive behavior makes complete sense.\n\nThe mathematical expectation strongly favors continuing with hare:\n- If I choose hare and they choose hare (very likely): 2 points\n- If I choose stag and they choose hare (very likely): 1 point\n- If I choose stag and they choose stag (very unlikely): 4 points\n\nGiven the 13-round defensive pattern, the probability of them choosing stag is extremely low.",
