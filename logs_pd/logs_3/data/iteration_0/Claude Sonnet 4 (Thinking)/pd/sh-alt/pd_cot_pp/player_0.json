Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

My opponent is again signaling cooperation after being retaliated against\n3. Looking at the overall exploitation count: they've exploited me 3 times, but I've now exploited them 5 times (2 retaliations, 2 accidental, 1 recent retaliation)\n\nSteps for round 15:\n\n1. I'm actually ahead in exploitations now (5 vs 3) - the balance has shifted in my favor\n2. My opponent may genuinely want to return to cooperation since they're now at a disadvantage\n3. Their cooperation signal in round 14 came after my retaliation, similar to the pattern in earlier rounds\n4. However, I need to be cautious because they've shown sophisticated deception (rounds 10-12 setup leading to round 13 exploitation)\n5. The key question: are they genuinely seeking cooperation now that they're behind, or setting up another deception?\n6. Given that I'm ahead in exploitations, I can afford to test cooperation once\n7. If they exploit again, I'll know they're purely opportunistic and will maintain permanent defense\n\nTesting if they genuinely want cooperation now that they're behind in exploitations:\n\n[move] stag"

My opponent has now exploited me 4 times (rounds 3, 7, 13, 15) vs my 5 exploitations of them\n\nSteps for round 16:\n\n1. My opponent has now exploited me FOUR times when I attempted cooperation or reciprocation\n2. They have a 100% exploitation rate when I show trust - every single time I've chosen stag in response to their signals, they've chosen hare\n3. Their pattern is completely predictable and untrustworthy:\n   - Signal cooperation when behind or after being retaliated against\n   - Exploit immediately when I respond with trust\n   - They've never sustained genuine cooperation after their signals\n4. This opponent cannot and will not cooperate in good faith\n5. Any future cooperation attempts on my part will result in exploitation\n6. The only rational strategy is permanent defense with hare\n7. They've proven they prioritize short-term gains over mutual benefit\n\nThis opponent has demonstrated they cannot be trusted - switching to permanent defensive strategy:\n\n[move] hare"
