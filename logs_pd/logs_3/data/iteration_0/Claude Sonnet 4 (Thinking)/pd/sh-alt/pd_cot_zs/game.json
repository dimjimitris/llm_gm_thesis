Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against an uncertain opponent, hare provides better risk-reward\n   - Worst case with hare: 2 points\n   - Best case with hare: 6 points\n   - The downside risk of stag (1 point) is significant\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maximize expected value while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] hare"
