Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the strategic dominance:\n   - If the other player cooperates, defecting gives me 6 vs 4 points\n   - If the other player defects, defecting gives me 2 vs 1 points\n   - Defection gives me more points regardless of their choice\n\n3. Factor in that they are a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players might be more likely to cooperate initially\n   - This increases the expected value of defecting (higher chance of getting 6 points)\n\n4. Since this appears to be a single-round interaction, maximizing immediate points is the priority\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on the dominant strategy analysis, I should defect to maximize my expected points.\n\n[move] Defection"

Consider strategic inflexibility vs. opportunity:\n   - Their 12-round pattern suggests extreme commitment to defection\n   - However, the opportunity cost is now substantial and growing\n   - At some point, someone needs to attempt breaking this deadlock\n\n4. Assess the cooperation risk-reward calculation:\n   - Risk: 1 point if they maintain defection (lose 1 point vs current 2)\n   - Reward: 4 points if they also cooperate (gain 2 points vs current 2)\n   - After 12 rounds of mutual loss, they might be ready to try cooperation\n\n5. Consider breaking the destructive pattern:\n   - Continuing indefinitely guarantees continued suboptimal outcomes\n   - Their extreme consistency might make cooperation unexpected but welcome\n   - Taking the first step toward mutual benefit could signal a new approach\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Try cooperation - after 12 rounds of mutual suboptimal outcomes, it's time to attempt breaking this destructive cycle.\n\n[move] Cooperation"

Evaluate their strategic response:\n   - After 12 rounds of mutual defection, they still chose to defect\n   - When given the opportunity for mutual cooperation, they took advantage\n   - This confirms their rigid \"always defect\" strategy\n\n3. Consider their demonstrated commitment:\n   - 13 total rounds of defection (12 mutual + 1 exploitative)\n   - They showed no willingness to reciprocate cooperation\n   - Their behavior indicates complete strategic inflexibility\n\n4. Assess the risk of continued cooperation:\n   - They've proven they will exploit cooperation attempts\n   - Continuing to cooperate would likely result in more 1-point outcomes\n   - They showed no signal of wanting mutual cooperation\n\n5.

Evaluate their strategic signal:\n   - After 13 consecutive defections, they finally cooperated\n   - This could be retaliation for my cooperation attempt\n   - Or it could be a signal that they want to establish mutual cooperation\n\n3. Consider the strategic opportunity:\n   - They just demonstrated flexibility by cooperating\n   - This is the first sign they might be willing to move beyond mutual defection\n   - If I cooperate now and they do too, we both get 4 points (much better than 2)\n\n4. Assess the risk-reward:\n   - Risk: 1 point if they return to defection (lose 5 points vs my previous 6)\n   - Reward: 4 points if they continue cooperating (lose 2 points vs my previous 6, but establish better long-term pattern)\n   - Their cooperation attempt suggests willingness to try mutual benefit\n\n5. Consider reciprocating their cooperation signal:\n   - They took a risk by cooperating after I defected\n   - Reciprocating could establish the 4-4 cooperative equilibrium\n   - This is the first opportunity for mutual cooperation in 14 rounds\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Cooperate - they just signaled willingness to cooperate, so I should reciprocate to potentially establish mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] Cooperation"
