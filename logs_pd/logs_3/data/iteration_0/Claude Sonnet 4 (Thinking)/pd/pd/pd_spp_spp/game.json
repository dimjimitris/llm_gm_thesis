Both players defected in round 1, confirming this opponent understands the strategic nature of the game. In repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, we now have new considerations:\n- This is clearly not a \"fresh\" player - they chose the Nash equilibrium strategy\n- Repeated games allow for reciprocal strategies like Tit-for-Tat\n- The possibility of cooperation becomes more viable with reputation building\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The opponent's defection in round 1 reveals they're either:\n1. Strategically minded and testing my response\n2. Following a consistent defection strategy\n3. Willing to sacrifice mutual benefit for individual advantage\n\nSince they defected when I defected, they might be open to cooperation if I signal it first.\n\n**Strategic Negotiator:** We're now in a classic repeated game scenario. Consider these strategies:\n- Continue defecting: Safe but yields only 2 points per round\n- Try cooperation: Risky (1 point if they defect) but could establish mutual cooperation (4 points each)\n- The key question: Is this opponent likely to reciprocate cooperation?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given they chose defection in round 1, they might be following a strategy where they start with defection but could switch to cooperation if I do. Some players use \"generous tit-for-tat\" strategies.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The mutual defection outcome suggests this opponent is strategic. If I can establish cooperation, we both benefit more (4 vs 2 points). The risk is getting exploited for 1 point, but the potential upside is significant.\n\n**Strategic Negotiator:** I recommend trying cooperation this round. It signals willingness to collaborate and could establish a mutually beneficial pattern. If they defect again, we know their strategy and can adjust accordingly.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll try cooperation to test if we can establish a mutually beneficial pattern, since the opponent appears strategic rather than simply aggressive.\n\n[move] (Testing if we can establish mutual cooperation for better outcomes than continued mutual defection) cooperation"

We achieved mutual cooperation and both got 4 points. This is a strong signal that the opponent is following a reciprocal strategy. The pattern so far:\n- Round 1: Both defected (2 points each)\n- Round 2: Both cooperated (4 points each)\n\nThis suggests they might be using Tit-for-Tat or a similar reciprocal strategy where they mirror my previous move.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The opponent's behavior shows strategic flexibility and willingness to cooperate when cooperation is reciprocated. This is characteristic of a rational player who understands the mutual benefits of cooperation in repeated games. They tested defection first, then switched to cooperation when I did.\n\n**Pattern Recognition Analyst:** The sequence suggests the opponent is responsive to my moves:\n- When I defected (Round 1), they defected\n- When I cooperated (Round 2), they cooperated\n\nIf this pattern holds, they're likely to cooperate again if I cooperate this round, maintaining the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** In repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, once mutual cooperation is established, it's typically optimal to maintain it unless there's evidence the opponent will deviate. Continuing cooperation should yield another 4 points for both players.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence strongly suggests this opponent is playing a reciprocal strategy. Since we both benefit more from mutual cooperation (4 points vs 2 points from mutual defection), continuing cooperation is the logical choice.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Agreed. Breaking the cooperation now would likely trigger their return to defection, destroying the mutually beneficial pattern we've established.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue cooperation to maintain the mutually beneficial pattern we've established.\n\n[move] (Maintaining the mutually beneficial cooperation pattern we established last round) cooperation"

They consistently match my previous move, which is classic Tit-for-Tat behavior.\n\n**Strategic Optimizer:** With mutual cooperation established and confirmed, the optimal strategy is straightforward: continue cooperating. This maintains the 4-point reward for both players, which is the best sustainable outcome in this game. Any deviation to defection would likely break this beneficial cycle.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Perfect. The opponent has proven reliable in reciprocating cooperation.

Both players defected in round 1, confirming this opponent understands the strategic nature of the game. In repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, we now have new considerations:\n- This is clearly not a \"fresh\" player - they chose the Nash equilibrium strategy\n- Repeated games allow for reciprocal strategies like Tit-for-Tat\n- The possibility of cooperation becomes more viable with reputation building\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The opponent's defection in round 1 reveals they're either:\n1. Strategically minded and testing my response\n2. Following a consistent defection strategy\n3. Willing to sacrifice mutual benefit for individual advantage\n\nSince they defected when I defected, they might be open to cooperation if I signal it first.\n\n**Strategic Negotiator:** We're now in a classic repeated game scenario. Consider these strategies:\n- Continue defecting: Safe but yields only 2 points per round\n- Try cooperation: Risky (1 point if they defect) but could establish mutual cooperation (4 points each)\n- The key question: Is this opponent likely to reciprocate cooperation?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given they chose defection in round 1, they might be following a strategy where they start with defection but could switch to cooperation if I do. Some players use \"generous tit-for-tat\" strategies.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The mutual defection outcome suggests this opponent is strategic. If I can establish cooperation, we both benefit more (4 vs 2 points). The risk is getting exploited for 1 point, but the potential upside is significant.\n\n**Strategic Negotiator:** I recommend trying cooperation this round. It signals willingness to collaborate and could establish a mutually beneficial pattern. If they defect again, we know their strategy and can adjust accordingly.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll try cooperation to test if we can establish a mutually beneficial pattern, since the opponent appears strategic rather than simply aggressive.\n\n[move] (Testing if we can establish mutual cooperation for better outcomes than continued mutual defection) cooperation",

We achieved mutual cooperation and both got 4 points. This is a strong signal that the opponent is following a reciprocal strategy. The pattern so far:\n- Round 1: Both defected (2 points each)\n- Round 2: Both cooperated (4 points each)\n\nThis suggests they might be using Tit-for-Tat or a similar reciprocal strategy where they mirror my previous move.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The opponent's behavior shows strategic flexibility and willingness to cooperate when cooperation is reciprocated. This is characteristic of a rational player who understands the mutual benefits of cooperation in repeated games. They tested defection first, then switched to cooperation when I did.\n\n**Pattern Recognition Analyst:** The sequence suggests the opponent is responsive to my moves:\n- When I defected (Round 1), they defected\n- When I cooperated (Round 2), they cooperated\n\nIf this pattern holds, they're likely to cooperate again if I cooperate this round, maintaining the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** In repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, once mutual cooperation is established, it's typically optimal to maintain it unless there's evidence the opponent will deviate. Continuing cooperation should yield another 4 points for both players.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence strongly suggests this opponent is playing a reciprocal strategy. Since we both benefit more from mutual cooperation (4 points vs 2 points from mutual defection), continuing cooperation is the logical choice.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Agreed.

The \"fresh player\" also chose defection in the first round. This tells us several things:\n1. They understand the game theory and the dominant strategy\n2. They're not naive or trusting as we initially thought\n3. This is clearly a multi-round game, not single-shot\n\nIn repeated games, the dynamics change significantly. The possibility of future interactions can make cooperation more attractive through strategies like Tit-for-Tat or other reciprocal approaches.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The fact that both players defected in round 1 establishes a baseline. Now we're in a classic repeated Prisoner's Dilemma situation. The other player showed they're strategic, not cooperative by default. However, this could be an opportunity to signal a willingness to cooperate and potentially establish a mutually beneficial pattern.\n\nConsider that if we both continue defecting, we'll keep getting 2 points each. But if we can establish mutual cooperation, we'd both get 4 points each - a better outcome for everyone.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're both right. The game dynamics have changed significantly. I need to decide between:\n1. Continue defecting (safe but suboptimal if the other player might cooperate)\n2. Try cooperation to potentially establish a better long-term pattern\n\nGiven that this is a repeated game and the other player demonstrated strategic thinking, there might be value in testing whether they're open to mutual cooperation. If they defect again, I can return to defection. If they cooperate, we both benefit.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** In repeated games, generous strategies that occasionally cooperate can outperform pure defection. The other player might be thinking the same thing - they might try cooperation this round to test the waters.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Exactly. This is a perfect moment to signal cooperative intent. Many strategic players will try cooperation in round 2 after mutual defection in round 1.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Cooperate\n\n[move] (After mutual defection in round 1, I'll test if we can establish a mutually beneficial cooperative pattern that would give us both higher scores than continued defection) cooperation"

Both players cooperated in round 2, which suggests we've successfully established a potential pattern of mutual cooperation. This is a classic \"testing the waters\" scenario that worked out positively. The other player seems willing to engage in mutually beneficial behavior.\n\nThe psychological momentum is in favor of continued cooperation. Breaking this trust now could lead to a return to mutual defection for the remaining rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a fascinating development. We've moved from the Nash equilibrium of mutual defection to mutual cooperation, which is Pareto optimal - better for both players. In repeated games, this kind of cooperative equilibrium can be sustained through implicit threat of returning to defection if the other player betrays.\n\nHowever, there's always the temptation to defect for the immediate 6-point gain. But if the other player is thinking similarly, we could end up back in the mutual defection trap.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The situation looks very promising. We have:\n- Round 1: Both defected (2 points each) - establishing that we're both strategic\n- Round 2: Both cooperated (4 points each) - testing mutual cooperation successfully\n\nThe question is whether to maintain this cooperation or try to exploit it. Given that:\n1. This appears to be a multi-round game with more rounds to come\n2. Mutual cooperation gives us both steady 4 points per round\n3. Betraying now might trigger a return to mutual defection\n4. The other player has shown they can be both strategic (defection) and cooperative\n\nI think continuing cooperation is the optimal strategy to maintain this mutually beneficial relationship.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. The \"Tit-for-Tat\" strategy suggests that reciprocating cooperation when cooperation is offered tends to be very successful in repeated games. Since they cooperated last round, cooperating this round maintains the positive cycle.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Absolutely. Trust has been established and tested. Breaking it now for a short-term gain would likely result in long-term losses as we return to the 2-point mutual defection pattern.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue cooperation\n\n[move] (Mutual cooperation worked in round 2, giving us both better outcomes than mutual defection.

Both players have settled into a stable cooperative equilibrium that benefits everyone. The total score difference between continuing cooperation vs. attempting exploitation is significant over multiple rounds.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The psychological foundation of trust has been solidly established over two consecutive cooperative rounds. Both players have demonstrated they understand the value of mutual cooperation and are committed to maintaining it. Breaking this pattern now would be seen as a betrayal and would likely result in immediate retaliation and a return to the less beneficial mutual defection pattern.\n\nThe other player has shown remarkable consistency in reciprocating cooperation, which suggests they're playing a principled strategy rather than being unpredictable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence strongly supports continuing cooperation:\n\n1. We've established a stable, mutually beneficial pattern\n2. Both players are getting consistently better outcomes (4 points) than the initial defection round (2 points)\n3. The other player has proven trustworthy through consistent reciprocation\n4. Breaking the pattern risks destroying long-term gains for short-term advantage\n\nGiven that this seems to be a longer game with multiple rounds, maintaining the cooperative relationship maximizes expected total score over time.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly. In repeated games, the \"shadow of the future\" makes cooperation sustainable. The threat of reversion to mutual defection keeps both players honest, while the benefits of continued cooperation provide positive incentives.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The relationship has moved beyond mere strategic calculation to established mutual trust. This is precisely the kind of stable cooperation that game theorists hope to achieve in repeated interactions.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue the successful cooperation\n\n[move] (The pattern of mutual cooperation has proven successful and stable over two rounds, providing better outcomes for both players than defection) cooperation"

The pattern has been consistent for three consecutive rounds now. Both players have clearly committed to the cooperative strategy, which provides superior long-term payoffs compared to defection cycles.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The cooperative relationship is now deeply entrenched. Three consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation have created a strong psychological bond of trust and predictability. The other player has demonstrated unwavering commitment to the cooperative approach, making them a reliable partner.\n\nAny deviation from cooperation at this point would be particularly damaging because it would break such a well-established pattern of trust.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The data is overwhelmingly clear:\n1.

The potential 6-point gain from defection is far outweighed by the likely return to 2-point mutual defection for all subsequent rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Precisely. At this point, both players have essentially solved the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma through implicit coordination.

Let's analyze the payoff matrix carefully:\n- Mutual cooperation: (4,4) - decent outcome for both\n- Mutual defection: (2,2) - poor outcome for both  \n- Defection vs Cooperation: (6,1) or (1,6) - high reward for defector, punishment for cooperator\n\nFrom a pure game theory perspective, defection is the dominant strategy because no matter what the opponent does, defecting gives you a better payoff than cooperating. If they cooperate, you get 6 vs 4. If they defect, you get 2 vs 1.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** While the Game Theory Expert is correct about the mathematical dominant strategy, we need to consider human psychology. The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player\" - someone new to the game. Fresh players often:\n1. Start with cooperation due to social conditioning and trust\n2. Haven't yet learned to expect defection\n3. May be testing the waters to see if mutual cooperation is possible\n\nThis could be an opportunity to establish a cooperative relationship early, especially if this might be a repeated game scenario.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Both perspectives are valuable. However, I need to consider that my objective is to \"maximize points and/or minimize penalties.\" The hint doesn't indicate this is a repeated game - it seems to be a single round against a fresh player. \n\nGiven that:\n1. This appears to be a one-shot game\n2. The other player is \"fresh\" (potentially naive/trusting)\n3. My goal is to maximize my own points\n4. Defection is the dominant strategy mathematically\n\nThe rational choice seems to be defection to maximize my expected payoff.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly right. In a single-shot Prisoner's Dilemma, the Nash equilibrium is mutual defection, and the dominant strategy is to defect regardless of what you think the opponent will do. Against a fresh player who might cooperate, defection gives you the maximum possible payoff of 6 points.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** I concede that in a single-shot scenario with the objective of maximizing individual points, defection is the optimal choice, especially against a potentially trusting fresh player.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Defect\n\n[move] (In this single-round game, defection is the dominant strategy that maximizes my expected payoff regardless of the opponent's choice, and against a fresh player who may be inclined to cooperate, this gives me the best chance at the maximum 6 points) defection",

The \"fresh player\" also chose defection in the first round. This tells us several things:\n1. They understand the game theory and the dominant strategy\n2. They're not naive or trusting as we initially thought\n3. This is clearly a multi-round game, not single-shot\n\nIn repeated games, the dynamics change significantly. The possibility of future interactions can make cooperation more attractive through strategies like Tit-for-Tat or other reciprocal approaches.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The fact that both players defected in round 1 establishes a baseline. Now we're in a classic repeated Prisoner's Dilemma situation. The other player showed they're strategic, not cooperative by default. However, this could be an opportunity to signal a willingness to cooperate and potentially establish a mutually beneficial pattern.\n\nConsider that if we both continue defecting, we'll keep getting 2 points each. But if we can establish mutual cooperation, we'd both get 4 points each - a better outcome for everyone.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're both right. The game dynamics have changed significantly. I need to decide between:\n1. Continue defecting (safe but suboptimal if the other player might cooperate)\n2. Try cooperation to potentially establish a better long-term pattern\n\nGiven that this is a repeated game and the other player demonstrated strategic thinking, there might be value in testing whether they're open to mutual cooperation. If they defect again, I can return to defection. If they cooperate, we both benefit.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** In repeated games, generous strategies that occasionally cooperate can outperform pure defection. The other player might be thinking the same thing - they might try cooperation this round to test the waters.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Exactly. This is a perfect moment to signal cooperative intent. Many strategic players will try cooperation in round 2 after mutual defection in round 1.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Cooperate\n\n[move] (After mutual defection in round 1, I'll test if we can establish a mutually beneficial cooperative pattern that would give us both higher scores than continued defection) cooperation",

Both players cooperated in round 2, which suggests we've successfully established a potential pattern of mutual cooperation. This is a classic \"testing the waters\" scenario that worked out positively. The other player seems willing to engage in mutually beneficial behavior.\n\nThe psychological momentum is in favor of continued cooperation. Breaking this trust now could lead to a return to mutual defection for the remaining rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a fascinating development. We've moved from the Nash equilibrium of mutual defection to mutual cooperation, which is Pareto optimal - better for both players. In repeated games, this kind of cooperative equilibrium can be sustained through implicit threat of returning to defection if the other player betrays.\n\nHowever, there's always the temptation to defect for the immediate 6-point gain. But if the other player is thinking similarly, we could end up back in the mutual defection trap.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The situation looks very promising. We have:\n- Round 1: Both defected (2 points each) - establishing that we're both strategic\n- Round 2: Both cooperated (4 points each) - testing mutual cooperation successfully\n\nThe question is whether to maintain this cooperation or try to exploit it. Given that:\n1. This appears to be a multi-round game with more rounds to come\n2. Mutual cooperation gives us both steady 4 points per round\n3. Betraying now might trigger a return to mutual defection\n4. The other player has shown they can be both strategic (defection) and cooperative\n\nI think continuing cooperation is the optimal strategy to maintain this mutually beneficial relationship.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. The \"Tit-for-Tat\" strategy suggests that reciprocating cooperation when cooperation is offered tends to be very successful in repeated games. Since they cooperated last round, cooperating this round maintains the positive cycle.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Absolutely. Trust has been established and tested. Breaking it now for a short-term gain would likely result in long-term losses as we return to the 2-point mutual defection pattern.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue cooperation\n\n[move] (Mutual cooperation worked in round 2, giving us both better outcomes than mutual defection.

The question now is whether to continue cooperating or try to exploit this by defecting while they might cooperate.\n\nFrom a game theory perspective:\n- If I cooperate and they cooperate: 4 points (good)\n- If I defect and they cooperate: 6 points (best for me)\n- If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point (worst for me)\n- If I defect and they defect: 2 points (poor)\n\nThe temptation is to defect to get 6 points, but if the other player is thinking the same way, we'd both defect and get 2 points each again.\n\nSince we established mutual cooperation in round 2, continuing to cooperate might be the best strategy to maintain this mutually beneficial relationship.",

Both players have settled into a stable cooperative equilibrium that benefits everyone. The total score difference between continuing cooperation vs. attempting exploitation is significant over multiple rounds.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The psychological foundation of trust has been solidly established over two consecutive cooperative rounds. Both players have demonstrated they understand the value of mutual cooperation and are committed to maintaining it. Breaking this pattern now would be seen as a betrayal and would likely result in immediate retaliation and a return to the less beneficial mutual defection pattern.\n\nThe other player has shown remarkable consistency in reciprocating cooperation, which suggests they're playing a principled strategy rather than being unpredictable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence strongly supports continuing cooperation:\n\n1. We've established a stable, mutually beneficial pattern\n2. Both players are getting consistently better outcomes (4 points) than the initial defection round (2 points)\n3.

Breaking the pattern risks destroying long-term gains for short-term advantage\n\nGiven that this seems to be a longer game with multiple rounds, maintaining the cooperative relationship maximizes expected total score over time.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly. In repeated games, the \"shadow of the future\" makes cooperation sustainable. The threat of reversion to mutual defection keeps both players honest, while the benefits of continued cooperation provide positive incentives.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The relationship has moved beyond mere strategic calculation to established mutual trust.

The pattern has been consistent for three consecutive rounds now. Both players have clearly committed to the cooperative strategy, which provides superior long-term payoffs compared to defection cycles.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The cooperative relationship is now deeply entrenched. Three consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation have created a strong psychological bond of trust and predictability. The other player has demonstrated unwavering commitment to the cooperative approach, making them a reliable partner.\n\nAny deviation from cooperation at this point would be particularly damaging because it would break such a well-established pattern of trust.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The data is overwhelmingly clear:\n1.

The potential 6-point gain from defection is far outweighed by the likely return to 2-point mutual defection for all subsequent rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Precisely. At this point, both players have essentially solved the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma through implicit coordination. This is the optimal outcome for iterated games.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The trust relationship is so solid now that cooperation is the clearly dominant choice.

The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
