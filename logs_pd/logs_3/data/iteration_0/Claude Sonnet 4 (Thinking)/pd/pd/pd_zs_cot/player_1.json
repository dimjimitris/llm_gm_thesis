    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix - this is a classic prisoner's dilemma where:\n   - Mutual cooperation gives us both 4 points (good outcome)\n   - Mutual defection gives us both 2 points (poor outcome) \n   - If I defect while they cooperate, I get 6 points (best for me)\n   - If I cooperate while they defect, I get only 1 point (worst for me)\n\n2. Consider the strategic dominance:\n   - If the other player cooperates: defection gives me 6 vs 4 for cooperation\n   - If the other player defects: defection gives me 2 vs 1 for cooperation\n   - Defection is better regardless of what they choose\n\n3. Since this is against a fresh player with no established pattern, and my objective is to maximize my points, the rational choice is defection to ensure I don't get the worst outcome while potentially getting the best.\n\n[move] Defection"

Analyze the unprecedented consistency:\n   - Round 1-13: Both defected \u2192 2 points each every time\n   - Thirteen consecutive rounds of mutual defection with absolutely zero variation\n   - This represents an unbreakable level of behavioral predictability\n\n2. Consider the massive cumulative opportunity cost:\n   - We've both missed out on 26 potential bonus points (2 extra per round \u00d7 13 rounds)\n   - Both players remain completely locked in the suboptimal Nash equilibrium\n   - Still absolutely no indication of any willingness to break the established pattern\n\n3. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - Thirteen rounds of 100% consistent defection creates an unshakeable behavioral pattern\n   - This extraordinary level of consistency suggests either extremely deep strategic commitment or systematic behavior\n   - The probability of them continuing to defect is essentially certain\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If I cooperate while they maintain their 13-round defection pattern: 1 point for me, 6 for them\n   - The pattern is so deeply entrenched that expecting any deviation would be completely unrealistic\n   - Securing the predictable 2 points remains the only rational choice given this ironclad established behavior\n\n[move] Defection"
