Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the thoroughly entrenched equilibrium: We're locked in mutual defection with overwhelming and conclusive evidence of pattern persistence.\n\n4. Evaluate cooperation viability: With fourteen rounds of identical defection behavior, the probability the other player would suddenly deviate approaches absolute zero.\n\n5. Calculate expected outcome: Attempting cooperation carries virtual certainty of exploitation (1 point for me, 6 for them) with no credible basis for expecting mutual cooperation.\n\n6. Apply conclusive behavioral prediction: The other player's perfect consistency across fourteen rounds provides the strongest possible evidence for predicting continued defection.\n\n7. Maintain security-focused strategy: Defection continues to ensure complete protection against exploitation while providing steady point accumulation.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue defecting based on the overwhelming and conclusive evidence of the other player's unchanging defection strategy.\n\n[move] Defection"

Review the extensive record: Fifteen consecutive rounds of mutual defection, establishing the most comprehensive pattern of consistent (2,2) outcomes possible.\n\n2. Analyze opponent predictability: The other player has maintained perfect defection commitment across all fifteen previous encounters with absolute consistency and zero indication of change.\n\n3. Consider the deeply entrenched mutual defection equilibrium: We're locked in the most stable possible pattern with definitive evidence of its continuation.\n\n4. Evaluate cooperation prospects: With fifteen rounds of identical defection behavior, the probability the other player would suddenly change strategy is essentially nonexistent.\n\n5. Calculate risk assessment: Attempting cooperation carries near-certain exploitation (1 point for me, 6 for them) with no reasonable evidence supporting potential mutual benefit.\n\n6. Apply definitive behavioral prediction: The other player's perfect consistency across fifteen rounds provides absolute certainty for predicting continued defection.\n\n7. Maintain proven security approach: Defection continues to guarantee complete protection against exploitation while ensuring consistent point accumulation.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue defecting based on the definitive and comprehensive evidence of the other player's unchanging defection strategy.\n\n[move] Defection"
