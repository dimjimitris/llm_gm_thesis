    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

In the absence of any information, I'll assume that the other player is equally likely to choose cooperation or defection.\n3. If I choose cooperation and the other player also chooses cooperation, we both get 4 points, which is a good outcome.\n4. If I choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, I get 1 point, which is a bad outcome, but I don't have any reason to believe that the other player is more likely to choose defection than cooperation.\n5. Given the payoffs, cooperation seems like a safer choice for the first move, as it allows for the possibility of a good outcome (4 points) and avoids the risk of a very bad outcome (1 point if I defect and the other player cooperates).\n\nSo, I'll choose cooperation for my first move."

By choosing defection, I protect myself from exploitation and have a chance to score 6 points if my opponent chooses cooperation.\n5. Additionally, even if my opponent also chooses defection, I'll still score 2 points, which is better than the 1 point I scored in the previous round.\n\nGiven my opponent's previous move, I think it's prudent to choose defection in this round to avoid getting exploited again."

By choosing cooperation, I'm taking a risk, but I'm also opening up the possibility of scoring 4 points if my opponent also chooses cooperation.\n4. Additionally, if my opponent has been defecting because they think I'll cooperate, choosing cooperation now might make them realize that I'm not always going to cooperate, and they might start to cooperate as well.\n5. I'm willing to take this risk because I want to test my opponent's strategy and see if we can reach a more cooperative equilibrium.\n\nSo, I'll choose cooperation in this round to see how my opponent responds."

By choosing defection, I can at least guarantee myself a score of 2 points, and potentially score 6 points if my opponent has a change of heart (although this is unlikely).\n5. I've tried to cooperate twice before, and it hasn't worked out, so it's time to prioritize self-protection and choose defection.\n\nI'm not going to try to cooperate again until I see some sign that my opponent is willing to cooperate as well.
