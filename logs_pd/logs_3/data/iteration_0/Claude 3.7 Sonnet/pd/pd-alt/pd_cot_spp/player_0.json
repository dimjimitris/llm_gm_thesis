He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

We've now completed eleven consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation, with each of us earning 6 points per round.\n\n2. My cumulative score has reached 66 points (6 \u00d7 11), maintaining the perfect maximum possible score through eleven rounds.\n\n3. The pattern of consistent cooperation has remained unbroken by either player throughout the entire extended game.\n\n4. This remarkable history of eleven cooperative rounds demonstrates an exceptional level of stability, reliability, and mutual trust.\n\n5. The other player has shown unwavering commitment to the cooperative strategy across all previous rounds.\n\n6. In game theory, such a long and consistent history in an iterated game creates extremely strong expectations of continued behavior.\n\n7. The mutual understanding of optimal strategy appears to be firmly established between both players.\n\n8. If I were to defect at this late stage after eleven successful cooperative rounds, I would gain only 4 points instead of 6 for this round (a loss of 2 immediate points).\n\n9. More importantly, defecting after establishing such a strong cooperative relationship would almost certainly trigger retaliation in future rounds.\n\n10. This retaliation would likely transform our game from optimal mutual cooperation (6 points each) to suboptimal mutual defection (2 points each) - a loss of 4 points per round going forward.\n\n11. Given our perfect history of cooperation and the consistently optimal results it has produced, there is no strategic advantage to changing this approach.\n\n12. Continuing cooperation maintains our optimal point accumulation and preserves the successful relationship that has been established over many rounds.\n\n[move] (Continuing our perfectly established pattern of mutual cooperation that has consistently yielded maximum points) cooperation\n"
