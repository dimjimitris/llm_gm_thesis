My opponent has defected in all thirteen rounds without exception.\n3. We've established a stable pattern of mutual defection for twelve consecutive rounds.\n4. The opponent has shown perfect consistency in their \"always defect\" strategy across a large sample size.\n5. With thirteen rounds of identical behavior, the probability of strategy change is effectively zero.\n6. If I defect, I will receive 2 points based on the extremely reliable pattern established.\n7. If I cooperate, based on overwhelming evidence, I would receive only 1 point.\n8. The expected value calculation heavily favors defection (guaranteed 2 points vs. almost certain 1 point).\n9. In game theoretic terms, we are in a Nash equilibrium of mutual defection.\n10. While this equilibrium is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation, it's the best achievable outcome given the opponent's demonstrated strategy.\n11. After thirteen rounds, there's no rational basis to expect a different outcome from changing my strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will defect again. With thirteen rounds of evidence showing my opponent's unwavering commitment to defection, choosing defection remains the only rational choice to maximize my points. Against an opponent who has demonstrated a pure \"always defect\" strategy with perfect consistency, the optimal response continues to be defection.\n\n[move] DEFECTION\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
