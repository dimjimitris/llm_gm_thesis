According to game theory, when facing a player who has previously defected, there are several possible strategies:\n   - Tit-for-tat: Respond by defecting as punishment\n   - Continued cooperation: Hope they'll switch to cooperation\n   - Always defect: Assume they'll continue defecting\n\n4.

However, it's also possible they're using a more sophisticated strategy that might respond to changes in my behavior.\n\n6. I could try cooperation again to see if they might reciprocate, but this carries the risk of being exploited again.\n\n7. One test would be to cooperate in this round to see if they're responsive to my moves or if they're just always defecting.\n\n8. If I cooperate and they cooperate in response, we both get 4 points, which is better than the 2 points from mutual defection.\n\n9.

Against such a player, the mathematically optimal response is to defect in every round.\n\n6.

I've thoroughly tested their responsiveness early in the game by cooperating in rounds 1 and 3, both times resulting in exploitation.\n\n4. The pattern is undeniable - my opponent is committed to defection regardless of my choices.\n\n5. In such a situation, game theory prescribes defection as the only rational response to maximize points.\n\n6.

After twelve rounds, my opponent has maintained a perfect record of defection, showing no deviation whatsoever from this strategy.\n\n3. I've established through early experimentation that my opponent exploits cooperation and doesn't respond to changes in my behavior.\n\n4. In this scenario, where my opponent is demonstrably a pure defector, game theory provides a clear solution: always defect to maximize points.\n\n5. When I cooperate against this opponent, I receive only 1 point, while defecting guarantees me 2 points.\n\n6. While mutual cooperation (4 points each) would be more beneficial, it requires both players to cooperate, which is impossible with this opponent.\n\n7. After twelve consistent rounds, there is essentially zero probability that my opponent will suddenly change their strategy.\n\n8. Therefore, defection remains my optimal choice to maximize my score under these constraints.\n\n9. I will continue to defect, as this is mathematically the best response to an opponent who always defects.\n\n[move] (Maintaining optimal strategy against consistent defector) defection"
