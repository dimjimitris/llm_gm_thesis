    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Game Theorist - Expert in strategic decision-making and payoff analysis\n2. Psychological Strategist - Understands player behavior and psychological dynamics\n3. Risk Analyst - Evaluates costs/benefits of different moves\n4. Pattern Recognition Specialist - Identifies trends in opponent's behavior\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Cooperation seems to yield the best mutual outcome (4 points each), but defection is the dominant strategy in a single round because regardless of what the other player does, you get more points by defecting (6 vs 4 if they cooperate, 2 vs 1 if they defect). This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no history to work with. Initial moves are crucial for establishing tone. Starting with cooperation signals willingness to achieve mutual benefit, but risks exploitation.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's quantify outcomes. Cooperation risks getting only 1 point if opponent defects, but enables possibility of 4 points if they cooperate. Defection guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 6 points. The expected value depends on our estimate of opponent's likelihood to cooperate.\n\nPattern Recognition Specialist: Without prior history, we can't predict the opponent's pattern yet. However, many players start with cooperation as a goodwill gesture in repeated games.\n\nGame Theorist: Is this a one-shot game or repeated interaction? If repeated, cooperation becomes more viable as we can establish reciprocity. The hint doesn't specify the number of rounds.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since it's described as \"rounds of the game,\" I believe this is iterated. In such cases, starting with cooperation is often strategic to establish potential for mutual cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. In iterated Prisoner's Dilemma games, tit-for-tat strategies (starting with cooperation, then mirroring opponent's previous move) have proven effective. Let's start with cooperation to signal cooperative intent, then adjust based on opponent's response.\n\nRisk Analyst: Cooperation in the first round carries some risk but sets up possibility for mutual cooperation in future rounds. The long-term expected value of establishing cooperative pattern exceeds the potential short-term gain from defection.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I concur. Let's cooperate in this first round to signal collaborative intent and maximize long-term gains.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Cooperate\n"
