However, if I cooperate and they defect, I get the worst outcome (1). If I defect and they cooperate, I get the best outcome (6).\n\n5. Since this is the first round, I could start with cooperation to establish mutual trust. If the other player is rational and recognizes the benefits of mutual cooperation, this could lead to the second-best outcome for both of us.\n\n6.
