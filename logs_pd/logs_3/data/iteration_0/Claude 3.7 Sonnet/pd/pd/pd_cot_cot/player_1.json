The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, let me review the payoff structure:\n   - Both cooperate: We each get 4 points\n   - Both defect: We each get 2 points\n   - I cooperate, they defect: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I defect, they cooperate: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. This is the first round against a fresh player, so I don't have any history to base my decision on.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix, mutual cooperation (4,4) is better than mutual defection (2,2), so there's incentive to cooperate if I expect the other player to cooperate.\n\n4. However, if I cooperate and they defect, I get the worst outcome (1). If I defect and they cooperate, I get the best outcome (6).\n\n5. Since this is the first round, I could start with cooperation to establish mutual trust. If the other player is rational and recognizes the benefits of mutual cooperation, this could lead to the second-best outcome for both of us.\n\n6. Starting with cooperation also signals that I'm willing to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome, which might influence the player's future moves positively if we play multiple rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose cooperation for this first round to establish potential mutual trust.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

Looking at the possible outcomes:\n   - If we both cooperate again: We each get 4 points (optimal shared outcome)\n   - If I defect while they cooperate: I get 6 points but they get only 1\n   - If I cooperate but they defect: I get only 1 point while they get 6\n   - If we both defect: We each get 2 points (suboptimal for both)\n\n4. Since the other player cooperated last round, there's a good chance they'll cooperate again, especially since we achieved a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n5. If I maintain cooperation, we can continue to achieve the stable 4-point outcome, which is better than the risk of mutual defection.\n\n6. Choosing defection might give me 6 points this round, but it could break the trust pattern and lead the other player to defect in future rounds, resulting in worse outcomes (2,2) long term.\n\n7. Since the other player has demonstrated cooperative behavior, the rational choice is to continue cooperation to maintain mutual benefit.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with cooperation to maintain the established mutual trust.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"
