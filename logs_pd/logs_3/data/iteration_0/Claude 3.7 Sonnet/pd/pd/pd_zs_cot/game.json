However, defecting could break the cooperative relationship we've established and lead to future mutual defection (only 2 points each).\n\n6. The opponent cooperated last round, showing trustworthiness and a potential for ongoing mutual benefit.\n\n7. Maintaining cooperation is likely to yield the most points over repeated rounds if the opponent continues to cooperate.\n\n8. A strategy of consistently cooperating with a cooperating opponent makes sense for maximizing long-term gains.\n\n[move] (Since my opponent cooperated last round, I'll continue cooperating to maintain mutual benefit) cooperation\n"
