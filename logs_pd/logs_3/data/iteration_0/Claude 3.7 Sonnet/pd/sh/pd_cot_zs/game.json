Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each (12 total)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (4 total)\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a game of coordination and trust. The stag-stag outcome is Pareto optimal (highest combined points).\n\n3. If I expect the other player to choose stag, I should choose stag (6 > 4).\n\n4. If I expect the other player to choose hare, I should choose hare (2 > 1).\n\n5. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n6. The stag strategy is risky but has higher potential reward. If we can establish mutual trust, this is best.\n\n7. The hare strategy is safer but has lower potential reward.\n\n8.
