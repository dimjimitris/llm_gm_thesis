He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1.

I'm playing against a fresh player, so I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria (both stag or both hare), but stag-stag is Pareto optimal.\n\n4. Choosing stag is risky but offers the highest mutual reward. It requires trust that the other player will also choose stag.\n\n5. Choosing hare is safer - I'll get at least 2 points, possibly 4, and never the minimum 1 point.\n\n6. Since this is the first round and there's no established trust yet, I need to consider which approach is better.\n\n7. I'll choose stag because:\n   - It opens the possibility for the highest payoff (6 points)\n   - It signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n   - It can establish a cooperative precedent for future rounds\n   - Many players recognize the benefit of mutual cooperation\n\n[move] stag\n"
