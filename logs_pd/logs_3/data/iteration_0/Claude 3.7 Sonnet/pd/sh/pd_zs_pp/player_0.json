I: hare, Opponent: stag (I got 4 points)\n\nLooking at my total points from each move:\n- When I chose stag: 1+1+6+1+1+1 = 11 points in 6 rounds (avg 1.83)\n- When I chose hare: 4+4+2+4+4+2+4 = 24 points in 8 rounds (avg 3)\n\nThe pattern in my opponent's behavior is:\n1. After I choose stag and they choose hare (exploiting me), they tend to choose stag if I switch to hare\n2. After we both cooperate with stag, they always defect in the next round\n3. After we both choose hare, they have sometimes cooperated with stag\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n[move] hare I'll choose hare again since my opponent just chose stag. While there's a chance they might choose hare this time, historically the hare strategy has given me significantly better average returns (3 points vs 1.83 points).\n"

This suggests there may be an opportunity for mutual cooperation.\n\nHowever, after these moments of cooperation, my opponent has always defected in the subsequent round, reverting to hare while I chose stag (rounds 7, 13).\n\nLooking at this cyclical pattern, and considering I know my opponent's behavior has been relatively predictable:\n\n[move] stag Since we both just chose hare, and historically this has been followed by mutual cooperation with stag, I'll choose stag this round. If the pattern holds, my opponent will also choose stag, resulting in the optimal outcome of 6 points each.\n"
