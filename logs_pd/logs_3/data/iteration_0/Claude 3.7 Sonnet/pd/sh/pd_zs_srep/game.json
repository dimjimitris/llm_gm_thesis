I: hare, Opponent: hare (I got 2 points)\n\nWe seem to have settled into a pattern of mutual hare choices, which gives us both a consistent but suboptimal 2 points each round. My opponent has consistently punished my stag choices with hare, indicating they are not interested in mutual cooperation for the higher payoff of 6 points each.\n\nGiven their demonstrated behavior across 15 rounds, there's no reason to expect they will suddenly cooperate. While the mutual hare outcome (2,2) is less than the potential cooperative outcome (6,6), it's better than the exploited outcome (1,4) that I've consistently received when choosing stag.\n\nI'll continue with hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"
