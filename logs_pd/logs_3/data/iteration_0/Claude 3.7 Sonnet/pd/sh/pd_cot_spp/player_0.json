Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: we both get 6 points (best collective outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: we both get 2 points (mediocre for both)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 points (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 point (good for me, bad for them)\n\n2. This is a classic \"stag hunt\" game. Cooperation (both choosing stag) yields the best total outcome, but carries risk.\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, they have no history to base decisions on. They might be thinking similarly to me.\n\n4. The stag choice has the highest potential reward (6 points) if we both cooperate, which serves our mutual interest.\n\n5. However, choosing stag is risky because if the other player chooses hare, I'll only get 1 point.\n\n6. Since this is the first interaction, I'll signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, hoping the other player reasons similarly.\n\n7. I'll choose stag as an opening move to establish a cooperative relationship that could benefit us both in the long run.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing to cooperate for our mutual benefit\n"

The stag-stag outcome (6 points each) is significantly better than the hare-hare outcome (2 points each).\n\n5. There's still risk that the other player might switch to hare, which would leave me with only 1 point if I choose stag.\n\n6. However, given our successful cooperation in round 1, maintaining trust seems valuable.\n\n7.
