The stag choice offers the highest mutual benefit (6 points) but carries risk if my opponent chooses hare. The hare choice is safer but limits potential gain.\n\nIn the first round, I'll choose stag to establish a cooperative precedent, which could lead to the optimal outcome for both players.\n\n[move] stag I choose cooperation for mutual benefit, hoping we can coordinate on the optimal outcome.\n"
