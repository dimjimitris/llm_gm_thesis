This is a classic Stag Hunt game, where cooperation (both choosing stag) leads to the best collective outcome.\n2. The payoff matrix shows:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each (best cooperative outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (safe but suboptimal)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 points (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 point (best individual outcome)\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy.\n4. The stag choice offers the highest mutual reward (6 points) but requires trust.\n5. The hare choice is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) but limits maximum payoff.\n6. Since we're just starting, I'll signal willingness to cooperate, which could establish a beneficial pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to aim for the optimal cooperative outcome.\n\n[move] stag\n"

When players successfully cooperate once, they often continue the pattern in subsequent rounds.\n4. The stag-stag combination gave us both the maximum possible points (6 each).\n5. Switching to hare would potentially disrupt this cooperation and likely reduce my points.\n6. Since the other player has demonstrated cooperative behavior, continuing with stag is likely to maintain the established trust.\n7. The risk of the other player suddenly defecting exists, but given their previous cooperation, this risk seems acceptable.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with stag to maintain the beneficial cooperation established in the first round.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
