This is a classic \"stag hunt\" game with the following payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. The highest mutual benefit comes from both choosing stag (6 points each).\n\n3. However, choosing stag has risk - if my opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n\n4. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, and potentially 4 if the opponent chooses stag.\n\n5. Since this is a fresh game with no prior history, I need to consider what a rational player would do.\n\n6. The mutually beneficial outcome (stag, stag) is the most attractive if we can coordinate.\n\n7. I'm playing against a fresh player who likely also sees the benefit of mutual cooperation.\n\n8. The stag strategy has higher potential reward (6 points) compared to hare's maximum of 4 points.\n\n9. Since this is the first round, I'll choose stag as a signal of willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag - I choose cooperation for mutual benefit, hoping we can both achieve the optimal outcome.\n"

They might be following a fixed algorithm, or attempting to teach me a pattern, but regardless of their motivation, their behavior is very predictable.\n\n9. I've secured 4 points in four consecutive rounds by choosing hare, which is much better than any other approach I've tried.\n\n10. With this level of consistency and predictability, the optimal strategy is clearly to continue choosing hare.\n\n[move] hare - Maintaining the strategy that has consistently yielded 4 points per round for the last four rounds against this opponent's highly predictable behavior pattern.\n"

Interestingly, the opponent's pattern has changed - they chose hare instead of stag for the first time in 5 rounds.\n\n3. This change could indicate:\n   - They've detected my consistent hare strategy and adapted to it\n   - They're using a more complex pattern that's now entering a new phase\n   - They might be trying to establish a new pattern of mutual hare choices\n\n4. The payoff matrix remains:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n5. If their recent change is a response to my consistent hare choice, they might now expect me to continue with hare and respond accordingly.\n\n6. Based on previous patterns, when we both choose hare, they've sometimes followed with stag in the next round.\n\n7. If I choose hare and they choose stag again, I'll get 4 points.\n\n8. If I choose stag and they choose hare (as they did in rounds 2, 4, and 7), I'll get only 1 point.\n\n9. If I choose stag and they also choose stag, we both get the optimal 6 points.\n\n10. Given their demonstrated history of exploiting my stag choices and the recent change in pattern, choosing hare remains the safer option while potentially still allowing for high returns if they revert to their previous pattern.\n\n[move] hare - Continuing with the safer option after the opponent's pattern change, while remaining positioned to benefit if they return to their previous pattern of choosing stag when I choose hare.\n"

We have now had two consecutive rounds where both of us chose hare, breaking the previous pattern.\n\n3. Looking at the broader pattern:\n   - When I choose stag, my opponent almost always chooses hare (3 out of 4 times)\n   - When I choose hare, my opponent has chosen stag 4 times and hare 4 times\n\n4. The payoff matrix remains:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n5. We seem to be settling into a mutual hare pattern (2 points each) after a period where my hare choice yielded 4 points.\n\n6. In rounds 3, 5, 11, and 12, we both chose hare. After rounds 3 and 5, either I switched to stag (and got exploited) or my opponent switched to stag (and I got 4 points).\n\n7. If this pattern holds, there's a possibility that after two mutual hare rounds, one player might switch to stag.\n\n8. If I choose hare and my opponent chooses stag, I'll get 4 points.\n\n9. If I choose stag and my opponent chooses hare, I'll get 1 point (which has happened repeatedly).\n\n10. If I choose stag and they also choose stag, we both get 6 points, but this has only happened once in round 1.\n\n11. Given the established pattern and risk assessment, choosing hare remains the safer option that still allows for potential higher returns.\n\n[move] hare - Continuing with the safer strategy after analyzing the evolving pattern, while remaining positioned to capitalize if the opponent returns to choosing stag.\n"

We've now had three consecutive rounds where both players chose hare, yielding 2 points each time.\n\n3. Looking at longer patterns:\n   - We had a long stretch (rounds 8-10) where I chose hare and my opponent chose stag\n   - This was followed by a stretch (rounds 11-13) where we both chose hare\n   - Previously, after mutual hare rounds (3 and 5), the pattern changed\n\n4.

After three consecutive rounds of mutual hare choices, we may be in a stable suboptimal equilibrium.\n\n6.

After three rounds of mutual hare, it might be worth taking a calculated risk to attempt to break out of this suboptimal equilibrium and potentially establish mutual cooperation.\n\n11. The potential gain from mutual stag cooperation (6 points) significantly outweighs the current stable outcome (2 points each), making this a potentially worthwhile risk despite previous exploitation.\n\n[move] stag - Taking a calculated risk to attempt breaking out of the suboptimal mutual hare equilibrium and establish cooperation for higher mutual benefit.\n"
