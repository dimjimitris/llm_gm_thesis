Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Game Theorist - Expert in analyzing strategic interactions and optimal decision making\n2. Behavioral Psychologist - Understands human decision patterns and cooperation dynamics\n3. Decision Strategist - Specializes in weighing tradeoffs and optimizing long-term outcomes\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game in game theory. The payoff matrix shows that (Stag, Stag) is Pareto-optimal with the highest joint payoff (6,6). However, choosing Hare is safer since it guarantees at least 2 points, while Stag risks getting only 1 point if the other player chooses Hare.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: With a fresh player who hasn't established any pattern, we need to consider their likely approach. Most people begin with cooperation in such games, especially when the cooperative outcome (Stag, Stag) is clearly best for both. However, some may choose Hare to play it safe.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze our expected value for each choice:\n- If we choose Stag: 6 points (if they choose Stag) or 1 point (if they choose Hare)\n- If we choose Hare: 4 points (if they choose Stag) or 2 points (if they choose Hare)\n\nGame Theorist: Since this is the first round with a new player, establishing cooperation would be valuable. The (Stag, Stag) outcome is mutually beneficial, so signaling willingness to cooperate could lead to better long-term results.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Research shows that in initial interactions, people tend to be more cooperative unless given reason to expect defection. The first move sets the tone for future interactions.\n\nDecision Strategist: While Hare provides a safer floor (minimum 2 points), the potential upside of Stag (6 points) is significant. Since we know nothing about this player's strategy yet, starting with Stag signals cooperative intent and offers the best joint outcome.\n\nGame Theorist: If we choose Stag and they choose Hare, we'll only get 1 point, but we'll learn valuable information about their strategy. If they're rational and see our cooperative intent, they may switch to Stag in future rounds.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Let's choose Stag with a clear explanation of our reasoning, which can encourage cooperation from the other player.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Stag. I choose cooperation for mutual benefit, as we both get the maximum possible points (6 each) if we both select Stag.\n"

Decision Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Excellent! Both players chose Stag in the first round, resulting in the optimal outcome of 6 points each. This suggests the other player is willing to cooperate and understands the benefits of mutual cooperation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The other player's choice of Stag in the first round is a positive sign. Research shows that when mutual cooperation is established in early rounds, it tends to persist. However, we should be aware that some players may switch to Hare after establishing trust, attempting to exploit our cooperation.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze the situation:\n1. The other player chose Stag in round 1, indicating cooperative intent\n2. Continuing with Stag maintains the optimal joint outcome (6,6)\n3. Switching to Hare could yield a short-term gain (4 points) but risks breaking the cooperative pattern\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, maintaining cooperation is generally the most profitable long-term strategy when both players have demonstrated willingness to cooperate. The Nash equilibrium of (Stag, Stag) is Pareto-optimal and sustainable if trust is maintained.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The psychological aspect of maintaining trust is important here. Betraying their cooperation now could lead to a breakdown in trust and shift the game to suboptimal outcomes in future rounds. Since they cooperated initially, there's a good chance they'll continue that strategy.\n\nDecision Strategist: The expected value still favors Stag if we believe the other player will continue cooperating. Maintaining the established pattern of cooperation maximizes our expected points over multiple rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: One last consideration - if this is known to be a finite game with a set number of rounds, there could be incentive to defect in the final round. However, since we don't know if this is the final round, maintaining cooperation is still the rational choice.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The consistent pattern of mutual cooperation also creates a sense of social norm that often prevents defection. Given all these factors, continuing with Stag appears to be the optimal choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Stag. Given our successful cooperation in the previous round (both choosing Stag for 6 points each), I'll continue with this mutually beneficial strategy.\n"

Decision Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: We've now had two consecutive rounds where both players chose Stag, resulting in the optimal outcome of 6 points each time. This establishes a clear pattern of mutual cooperation and suggests a tacit agreement to continue with the Pareto-optimal strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Two consistent rounds of cooperation significantly strengthen the trust between players. The psychological commitment to this mutually beneficial pattern is now stronger. However, as games progress, some players might become tempted to exploit established trust, especially if they believe the game may be ending soon.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze our current situation:\n1. The pattern of mutual cooperation (Stag, Stag) is firmly established over two rounds\n2. Both players have received maximum individual rewards (12 points total) through cooperation\n3. Disrupting this pattern would likely trigger reciprocal defection in future rounds\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, when a cooperative equilibrium has been established and maintained, continuing with the same strategy remains optimal unless there's a reason to believe the other player will defect. There's no indication of that here.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The psychological principle of consistency suggests that both players are likely to maintain their established pattern. Breaking this pattern would not only potentially reduce our points in this round but could destroy the cooperative dynamic we've built.\n\nDecision Strategist: Even considering potential short-term gains from switching to Hare (4 points if they choose Stag), the expected long-term value is still higher with continued cooperation. The established pattern suggests the other player will almost certainly choose Stag again, making Stag our optimal choice as well.\n\nGame Theorist: One consideration is whether this might be the final round, which could theoretically incentivize defection. However, without any indication that the game is ending, maintaining cooperation remains the rational choice based on the history of play.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The principle of reciprocity also supports continuing with Stag. The other player has \"rewarded\" our cooperative behavior twice, and disrupting this pattern would likely trigger a negative reciprocal response in future interactions.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Stag. Our mutual cooperation strategy has been successful for two consecutive rounds, yielding the maximum possible points (6) each time. I'll continue this optimal pattern of cooperation.\n"

Decision Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: We now have three consecutive rounds where both players chose Stag, consistently achieving the optimal outcome of 6 points each round. This firmly establishes a cooperative equilibrium that has benefited both players equally.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Three consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation create a very strong norm and expectation. At this point, breaking the pattern would be seen as a significant violation of trust. The psychological commitment to cooperation is now deeply ingrained in this interaction.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze our current situation:\n1. The cooperative pattern is now well-established over three rounds\n2. Both players have consistently maximized their points (18 points total each)\n3. There's no indication that the other player is considering defection\n4. The expected value of continuing cooperation remains high\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games with consistent history, the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. With three rounds of mutual Stag choices, game theory would strongly suggest maintaining this strategy for maximum payoff.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The principle of consistency is even stronger now. Players become more committed to their strategies as they repeat them successfully. Additionally, at this point, a defection would feel like a betrayal rather than a strategic move, potentially triggering a stronger negative response.\n\nDecision Strategist: Looking at the long-term value, continued cooperation still yields the highest expected return. While choosing Hare could theoretically yield 4 points in a single round if they maintain Stag, this would likely end the cooperative dynamic and reduce our points in all future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: There's still the consideration of whether this might be the final round, but without any indication of the game ending, and with such a strong history of cooperation, maintaining Stag remains the optimal choice.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The established pattern of mutual benefit creates strong psychological incentives to continue cooperating. Breaking this pattern now would seem irrational given the success we've had.\n\nDecision Strategist: One additional point: even if we were to consider a more complex strategy involving occasional defection, the optimal time to implement such a strategy would not be after establishing such a clear cooperative pattern. The benefits of maintaining trust outweigh any potential short-term gain.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Stag. We've successfully established a mutually beneficial pattern over three consecutive rounds, each yielding the maximum 6 points. I'll maintain this optimal cooperative strategy.\n"

Decision Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: We've now completed four consecutive rounds with both players choosing Stag, consistently achieving the optimal outcome of 6 points each round. This represents a stable cooperative equilibrium that has been maintained throughout the game.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Four consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation demonstrate an extremely strong pattern and implicit agreement. At this point, the cooperative norm is firmly established, and both players have demonstrated consistent commitment to maximizing mutual benefit.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze our current situation:\n1. The cooperative pattern has been maintained perfectly for four rounds\n2. Both players have accumulated 24 points each (4 rounds \u00d7 6 points)\n3. The strategy has been optimal for both players\n4. There's no indication of any intent to deviate from this successful pattern\n\nGame Theorist: With such a consistent history, game theory strongly suggests maintaining the established equilibrium. The pattern indicates that the other player understands and values the mutual benefits of cooperation, making continued cooperation the rational choice.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological investment in this cooperation has deepened with each round. Four consistent choices create a very strong behavioral pattern that becomes increasingly difficult to break. Both players would likely feel that deviating now would be counterproductive and potentially irrational.\n\nDecision Strategist: From a risk-reward perspective, continuing with Stag maintains our established pattern of securing 6 points per round. Switching to Hare might yield 4 points if the other player maintains Stag, but would almost certainly disrupt future cooperation, resulting in lower total points across subsequent rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Even if we were to consider this might be the final round (which we have no indication of), the strength of the established pattern suggests the other player is likely to continue with Stag regardless, making our best response also Stag.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The consistent reciprocity we've observed suggests this player values fair and mutually beneficial outcomes. Breaking this pattern now would be particularly jarring after four rounds of successful cooperation.\n\nDecision Strategist: Considering all factors - the history of play, the demonstrated reliability of the other player, and the potential outcomes - continuing with Stag remains the optimal choice for maximizing our expected points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Stag. Our strategy of mutual cooperation has been consistently successful across four rounds, with each of us earning the maximum 6 points per round.

Decision Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a critical turning point in the game. After four consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation, the other player has defected by choosing Hare while we continued with Stag. This resulted in an asymmetric outcome where we received only 1 point while they received 4 points.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This defection after establishing a strong cooperative pattern is significant. It suggests either: 1) the other player was strategically building trust before exploiting it, 2) they believe the game might be ending soon and are maximizing short-term gains, or 3) they're testing our response to see if we'll continue cooperating despite defection.\n\nDecision Strategist: This completely changes our decision landscape. Let's analyze:\n1. The cooperative equilibrium has been broken\n2. We've been exploited in the previous round (1 point vs their 4 points)\n3. Continuing with Stag risks repeated exploitation\n4. We need to signal that defection has consequences\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, this situation often calls for a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy - responding to defection with defection to signal that exploitation will not be tolerated. This can potentially restore cooperation in future rounds by demonstrating we won't be repeatedly exploited.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. Research shows that forgiveness (continuing to cooperate after being exploited) without some signal of disapproval often leads to continued exploitation. A single reciprocal defection signals that we noticed their defection and are willing to protect our interests.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's evaluate expected outcomes:\n- If we choose Stag: Best case 6 points (if they return to cooperation), worst case 1 point (if they defect again)\n- If we choose Hare: Best case 4 points (if they choose Stag), worst case 2 points (if they choose Hare)\n\nThe minimum payoff with Hare (2) is better than the minimum with Stag (1), and if they continue defecting, we're better protected.\n\nGame Theorist: A single retaliatory defection followed by a return to cooperation is often effective in restoring cooperative equilibrium. This \"forgive but don't forget\" approach signals that we're willing to cooperate but not be exploited repeatedly.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This approach also acknowledges the psychological reality that continuing to cooperate after exploitation can be interpreted as weakness or naivety. A proportional response demonstrates awareness and strategic thinking.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given the broken trust and need to protect against further exploitation, choosing Hare for this round appears optimal. It limits our downside risk while signaling that defection has consequences.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. After this round, we can evaluate their response and potentially return to cooperation if they demonstrate renewed commitment to mutual benefit.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Hare. After four rounds of successful cooperation, my opponent unexpectedly defected in the last round, earning 4 points while leaving me with just 1. I'm choosing Hare as a proportional response to signal that cooperation requires mutual commitment.\n"

Decision Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: We've now experienced a significant shift in the game dynamics. After four rounds of mutual cooperation (Stag-Stag), the other player defected in round 5 (we chose Stag, they chose Hare), and we responded with Hare in round 6, which they also chose. This resulted in a suboptimal outcome of 2 points each, compared to the 6 points each we were achieving with mutual cooperation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The pattern is interesting - they defected first after a long cooperation streak, and when we responded with Hare, they also chose Hare. This could mean: 1) they anticipated our defection as retaliation, 2) they've shifted to a more risk-averse strategy, or 3) they're using a tit-for-tat strategy that simply mirrored our previous move.\n\nDecision Strategist: We're now at a critical juncture. Both players have experienced the suboptimal outcome of mutual defection (Hare-Hare) with only 2 points each. This creates a potential opening to restore cooperation, as both parties have seen that mutual defection leaves both worse off than mutual cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, this is sometimes called a \"reset point\" - after punishment phases, players have the opportunity to re-establish cooperation. Returning to Stag now could signal willingness to return to the Pareto-optimal outcome that benefits both players.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological principle of reciprocity suggests that making a cooperative move now could trigger reciprocal cooperation. Since both players have now \"punished\" each other and experienced the suboptimal outcome, there's a natural opening to rebuild cooperation.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze the potential outcomes:\n- If we choose Stag: Best case 6 points (if they choose Stag), worst case 1 point (if they choose Hare)\n- If we choose Hare: Best case 4 points (if they choose Stag), worst case 2 points (if they choose Hare)\n\nGame Theorist: While Hare provides a safer floor (minimum 2 points), it keeps us locked in the suboptimal equilibrium. To potentially restore the superior outcome of mutual cooperation, one player needs to make the first move back toward Stag.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Research on conflict resolution shows that after a period of mutual defection, someone needs to take the initiative to restore cooperation. Since we were responsive to their defection, showing we won't be exploited repeatedly, we're now in a position to initiate a return to cooperation.\n\nDecision Strategist: There is risk in returning to Stag, but the potential gain outweighs it. If successful in restoring cooperation, we return to 6 points per round rather than 2. Even if they defect one more time, the long-term benefit of potentially restoring cooperation outweighs the short-term loss.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The optimal strategy appears to be returning to Stag as an invitation to restore mutual cooperation, with the understanding that if they defect again, we would likely need to respond with Hare in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Stag. After mutual defection resulted in just 2 points each, I'm initiating a return to cooperation. This sends a signal that I recognize the mutual benefit of both choosing Stag (6 points each) versus the suboptimal outcome of mutual defection (2 points each).\n"

Decision Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a significant development. We attempted to restore cooperation by choosing Stag, but the other player has defected again by choosing Hare. This is now the second consecutive round where they've exploited our cooperative move. The pattern strongly suggests they are pursuing a strategy of exploitation rather than cooperation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their consistent defection despite our attempt to restore cooperation reveals important information about their strategy. They appear to be maximizing their own short-term gains rather than working toward mutual benefit. After exploiting our cooperation twice, the likelihood that they'll suddenly return to cooperation is quite low.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze what's happened:\n1. After 4 rounds of mutual cooperation, they defected in round 5 (gaining 4 points while we got 1)\n2. We responded with Hare in round 6, resulting in mutual defection (2 points each)\n3. We attempted to restore cooperation in round 7, but they defected again (they got 4 points, we got 1)\n4. We've been exploited twice now, losing a total of 10 potential points\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, when a player repeatedly defects despite attempts to restore cooperation, the rational response is typically to switch to a more defensive strategy. Their behavior suggests they're not playing tit-for-tat (which would have returned to Stag after our Hare) but rather exploiting any cooperative move we make.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Their pattern indicates either a purely self-interested strategy or possibly a misunderstanding of the game's optimal outcomes. Either way, continuing to choose Stag would be naive given the established pattern of exploitation.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's evaluate expected outcomes again:\n- If we choose Stag: Based on their pattern, they'll likely choose Hare again, giving us 1 point and them 4\n- If we choose Hare: If they choose Stag (unlikely given their pattern), we get 4 points; if they choose Hare, we get 2 points\n\nThe expected value clearly favors Hare at this point, as it protects us against further exploitation.\n\nGame Theorist: With two consecutive exploitations of our cooperative moves, the probability of them suddenly switching to cooperation is very low. The prudent strategy is to protect ourselves with Hare, which ensures at least 2 points rather than risking another round of getting only 1 point.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: From a psychological perspective, their consistent exploitation despite our signaling attempts suggests they've adopted a purely competitive rather than collaborative approach to the game. In such cases, matching their strategy is appropriate to minimize losses.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given their demonstrated pattern of exploiting cooperation, choosing Hare is clearly the optimal choice for this round. It minimizes our potential losses while sending a clear signal that we won't continue to be exploited.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Hare. After attempting to restore cooperation in the previous round and being exploited again, I'm choosing Hare to protect against continued exploitation. My opponent has now defected twice when I chose Stag, indicating they're not interested in mutual cooperation.\n"

Behavioral Psychologist\n3. Decision Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the complete game history:\n- Rounds 1-4: Mutual cooperation (Stag-Stag), 6 points each per round\n- Round 5: They defected (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 6: Mutual defection (Hare-Hare), 2 points each\n- Round 7: We attempted cooperation, they defected (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 8: Mutual defection (Hare-Hare), 2 points each\n\nThis pattern reveals important information about their strategy. They've exploited our cooperation twice and matched our defection twice.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their pattern suggests they might be using a strategy similar to \"win-stay, lose-shift.\" When they successfully exploited us, they continued with Hare. When we both chose Hare and they received a lower payoff, they didn't switch back to cooperation but remained defensive.\n\nDecision Strategist: We're now locked in a suboptimal equilibrium of mutual defection. While this is better than being exploited, it's still far inferior to the mutual cooperation we achieved in the first four rounds. The question is whether there's a way to potentially restore cooperation or if we should maintain our defensive stance.\n\nGame Theorist: One possibility is to attempt another cooperative move (Stag) to see if they're willing to return to mutual cooperation after experiencing the suboptimal mutual defection outcome twice. However, given their previous exploitation of our cooperative attempts, this carries significant risk.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their consistent pattern suggests low likelihood of reciprocating cooperation at this point. They've shown a preference for exploitation when given the opportunity. After experiencing multiple rounds of suboptimal outcomes, some players would reconsider their strategy, but they haven't shown signs of this adaptation.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's consider the expected values again:\n- If we choose Stag: Based on their demonstrated pattern, they'll likely choose Hare again, giving us 1 point and them 4\n- If we choose Hare: If they choose Stag (which seems unlikely), we get 4 points; if they choose Hare (more likely), we get 2 points\n\nGame Theorist: Given their established pattern of exploiting cooperation and not returning to cooperation despite suboptimal outcomes, the rational choice remains Hare. This secures at least 2 points rather than risking another exploitation for just 1 point.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. While in some games there might be value in occasionally testing whether the other player has adjusted their strategy, their consistent pattern of exploitation suggests they're committed to a competitive rather than collaborative approach.\n\nDecision Strategist: The opportunity cost of another failed cooperation attempt (potentially losing 1 point instead of securing 2) outweighs the potential benefit of restoring cooperation in this case, especially given their demonstrated pattern. Maintaining Hare is the optimal choice for this round.\n\nGame Theorist: One additional consideration is that some players might eventually return to cooperation after extended mutual defection, but only after the \"punishment phase\" has made the point that exploitation won't be tolerated. However, there's insufficient evidence that this player would respond to such a strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Hare. Based on the established pattern where my opponent has exploited my cooperative moves twice and shown no indication of returning to mutual cooperation, I'll continue with Hare to secure at least 2 points rather than risking exploitation for only 1 point.\n"

            "text": "I'll collaborate with my personas to determine our strategy after this interesting development where the opponent chose Stag.\n\nPersonas:\n1. Game Theorist\n2. Behavioral Psychologist\n3. Decision Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a significant change in the pattern! Let's update our game history:\n- Rounds 1-4: Mutual cooperation (Stag-Stag), 6 points each per round\n- Round 5: They defected (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 6: Mutual defection (Hare-Hare), 2 points each\n- Round 7: We attempted cooperation, they defected (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 8: Mutual defection (Hare-Hare), 2 points each\n- Round 9: They chose Stag while we chose Hare, we got 4 points, they got 1\n\nThis is the first time they've chosen Stag since the initial cooperation phase. This could be an attempt to restore cooperation after experiencing the suboptimal mutual defection outcome.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their switch to Stag after multiple rounds of defection is interesting. It could indicate: 1) they're attempting to signal a return to cooperation, 2) they're using a more complex strategy that involves periodic cooperation, or 3) they're trying to see if we'll exploit their cooperation as they did to us.\n\nDecision Strategist: This presents a strategic dilemma. Do we reciprocate their apparent cooperative move and return to Stag, potentially restoring the optimal mutual outcome? Or do we remain defensive, suspecting this might be a temporary shift before returning to exploitation?\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, this could be interpreted as an invitation to restore the cooperative equilibrium. Their choice of Stag despite our previous Hare moves could be a \"costly signal\" indicating genuine interest in returning to cooperation. However, given their previous pattern of exploitation, caution is warranted.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The principle of reciprocity suggests that responding to their cooperation with cooperation could lead to a restoration of trust. However, their inconsistent pattern makes it difficult to predict their next move with confidence.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze the potential outcomes:\n- If we choose Stag: Best case 6 points (if they choose Stag again), worst case 1 point (if they revert to Hare)\n- If we choose Hare: Best case 4 points (if they choose Stag again), worst case 2 points (if they revert to Hare)\n\nGame Theorist: One approach would be a \"cautious reciprocity\" strategy - responding to their cooperative move with cooperation, but being ready to revert to Hare if they exploit again. This would signal willingness to restore cooperation while protecting against extended exploitation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their choice of Stag after we chose Hare twice in a row does suggest a deliberate attempt to change the game dynamic. Reciprocating could potentially restore the more beneficial mutual cooperation we had in the early rounds.\n\nDecision Strategist: While choosing Hare again guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4 if they continue with Stag, it would likely end any chance of returning to mutual cooperation. Choosing Stag carries more risk but also the potential to restore the optimal outcome of 6 points per round.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they've now experienced being exploited themselves (getting only 1 point in the last round), they might better understand the value of mutual cooperation. This increases the probability that their Stag move is a genuine attempt to restore cooperation rather than a temporary deviation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. After experiencing exploitation themselves, they may have recognized that mutual cooperation is preferable to the cycle of exploitation and counter-exploitation. Their Stag move might reflect this realization.\n\nDecision Strategist: Considering all factors, choosing Stag appears to be the optimal move at this point. It responds to their apparent cooperative signal and creates the possibility of restoring the mutually beneficial equilibrium. If they exploit again, we can always return to Hare in the next round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Stag. My opponent has switched to Stag after several rounds of defection, potentially signaling a desire to return to mutually beneficial cooperation. I'll reciprocate this cooperative move, which could restore our earlier pattern where we both earned the maximum 6 points per round.\n"

Behavioral Psychologist\n3. Decision Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This latest development is very informative. Let's update our game history:\n- Rounds 1-4: Mutual cooperation (Stag-Stag), 6 points each per round\n- Round 5: They defected (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 6: Mutual defection (Hare-Hare), 2 points each\n- Round 7: We attempted cooperation, they defected (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 8: Mutual defection (Hare-Hare), 2 points each\n- Round 9: They chose Stag, we chose Hare (Hare-Stag), we got 4 points, they got 1\n- Round 10: We attempted cooperation, they defected again (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n\nTheir pattern now shows they're willing to exploit our cooperation consistently but aren't committed to sustained cooperation themselves. They appear to be maximizing short-term gains rather than working toward mutual benefit.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their behavior demonstrates a consistent opportunistic strategy. They've now exploited our cooperation three times. Their single cooperative move in round 9 wasn't part of a genuine attempt to restore mutual cooperation but appears to have been a temporary deviation or possibly an attempt to lure us back to a vulnerable position they could exploit.\n\nDecision Strategist: This pattern makes our decision much clearer. We've given them multiple opportunities to demonstrate commitment to mutual cooperation, and they've consistently chosen exploitation when given the opportunity. We've now been exploited in 3 out of 10 rounds when choosing Stag.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory terms, their strategy appears to be primarily exploitative rather than cooperative. Continuing to choose Stag would be irrational given the established pattern and would lead to continued suboptimal outcomes for us.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. They've demonstrated a consistent preference for maximizing their own points at our expense when given the opportunity. The one time they chose Stag was immediately followed by exploiting our cooperative response, suggesting it was tactical rather than representing a genuine shift toward cooperation.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze the expected outcomes again:\n- If we choose Stag: Based on their consistent pattern of exploitation, they're highly likely to choose Hare, giving us 1 point and them 4\n- If we choose Hare: If they choose Stag (as they did once before), we get 4 points; if they choose Hare, we get 2 points\n\nThe expected value clearly favors Hare at this point.\n\nGame Theorist: With three instances of exploitation when we chose Stag, including immediately after their single cooperative move, the optimal strategy is clearly to choose Hare. This protects against further exploitation and ensures a minimum of 2 points rather than risking another round of getting only 1 point.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their behavior shows they cannot be trusted to maintain cooperation. At this point, choosing Hare is not just strategically optimal but also sends a clear message that repeated exploitation will not be rewarded with further opportunities for easy gains.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given their demonstrated pattern, choosing Hare is the optimal move. It's the only way to protect against continued exploitation and potentially incentivize more cooperative behavior in future rounds, though the likelihood of them shifting to consistent cooperation seems low based on their pattern so far.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Hare. After being exploited for the third time when choosing Stag, including immediately after my opponent's single cooperative move, I must protect against further exploitation. Their pattern clearly shows they choose Hare whenever I cooperate, making Hare my optimal choice.\n"

Behavioral Psychologist\n3. Decision Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's update our game history:\n- Rounds 1-4: Mutual cooperation (Stag-Stag), 6 points each per round\n- Round 5: They defected (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 6: Mutual defection (Hare-Hare), 2 points each\n- Round 7: We attempted cooperation, they defected (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 8: Mutual defection (Hare-Hare), 2 points each\n- Round 9: They chose Stag, we chose Hare (Hare-Stag), we got 4 points, they got 1\n- Round 10: We attempted cooperation, they defected again (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 11: They chose Stag again, we chose Hare (Hare-Stag), we got 4 points, they got 1\n\nThis is fascinating. They've now chosen Stag twice when we chose Hare, getting only 1 point each time. This suggests they might be using a strategy where they alternate between Stag and Hare regardless of our moves, or they could be attempting to establish a pattern to encourage our cooperation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their pattern is becoming clearer, but also more complex. They seem to be choosing Stag every other round recently (rounds 9 and 11), regardless of what we choose. This could indicate they're following a predetermined pattern rather than responding directly to our moves. Alternatively, they might be genuinely trying to signal cooperation but are inconsistent in maintaining it.\n\nDecision Strategist: This presents an interesting dilemma. Their alternating pattern might suggest they'll choose Hare in the next round regardless of our choice. If that's true, choosing Hare would give us 2 points while choosing Stag would give us only 1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: If we assume they're following a strict alternating strategy (which their recent moves suggest), they would choose Hare in the next round. Under that assumption, choosing Hare ourselves would be optimal, giving us 2 points rather than the 1 point we'd get by choosing Stag.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: However, we should consider that they might be using a more sophisticated strategy. Their choice of Stag twice when we chose Hare could be an attempt to show they're willing to accept the lower payoff occasionally to demonstrate cooperative intent. They might be hoping we'll eventually choose Stag again to restore mutual cooperation.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze the potential outcomes based on their recent pattern:\n- If they're following a strict alternating pattern, they'll choose Hare next regardless of our move\n- If they're attempting to encourage cooperation, they might choose Stag again if we choose Stag\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they've now willingly accepted the worst outcome (1 point) twice by choosing Stag when we chose Hare, there's a non-trivial probability they're attempting to signal cooperative intent rather than just following a predetermined alternating pattern.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their willingness to absorb the lowest payoff twice is noteworthy. In behavioral economics, this could be interpreted as a costly signal of their willingness to cooperate. However, their previous exploitation of our cooperation creates ambiguity about their true intent.\n\nDecision Strategist: We need to weigh the risks and potential rewards:\n- If we choose Stag and they choose Stag: 6 points (optimal outcome)\n- If we choose Stag and they choose Hare: 1 point (worst outcome, which has happened 3 times)\n- If we choose Hare and they choose Stag: 4 points (what happened in rounds 9 and 11)\n- If we choose Hare and they choose Hare: 2 points (what happened in rounds 6 and 8)\n\nGame Theorist: Given their inconsistent but potentially signaling behavior, this might be a case where testing cooperation has value. If they're genuinely trying to establish cooperation through their alternating pattern, choosing Stag could help verify this and potentially restore the optimal equilibrium.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I see merit in that approach. Their repeated choice of Stag despite getting the worst outcome could indeed be a strong signal. However, we should be prepared to revert to Hare if they exploit our cooperation again.\n\nDecision Strategist: While choosing Hare is safer, the potential upside of restoring cooperation (6 points per round) is significant. Given their recent choices suggesting possible cooperative intent, a cautious test of Stag could be worthwhile at this point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Stag. My opponent has chosen Stag twice recently despite receiving the lowest payoff (1 point), which may signal a genuine desire to restore mutual cooperation. While there's risk, successfully reestablishing cooperation would yield the optimal outcome (6 points each). I'll cautiously test this possibility.\n"

Their pattern is becoming clearer: they alternate between Stag and Hare regardless of what we do. When we choose Stag, they consistently choose Hare to exploit us. When we choose Hare, they sometimes choose Stag and get exploited themselves.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their behavior now strongly suggests they're following a predetermined alternating strategy rather than responding to our moves. They've chosen Hare in rounds 5, 7, 10, and 12, and Stag in rounds 1-4, 9, and 11. This looks like a pattern of alternating between Stag and Hare regardless of our choices, with the exception of the early cooperative rounds.\n\nDecision Strategist: If they're indeed following a simple alternating pattern, then we can predict they'll choose Stag in the next round (round 13). In that case, choosing Hare would be optimal for us, yielding 4 points rather than the 6 we'd get from mutual cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: This appears to be what's called a \"non-responsive strategy\" in game theory - their moves don't depend on our moves but follow a predetermined sequence. If they're truly alternating, then we can maximize our points by choosing Hare when we predict they'll choose Stag, and Hare when we predict they'll choose Hare (to avoid the worst outcome of 1 point).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Their consistent exploitation when we choose Stag (4 out of 4 times in non-cooperative rounds) suggests they're either not interested in mutual cooperation or are following a strategy that doesn't respond to our moves. Either way, choosing Stag again would likely result in another exploitation.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze the expected outcomes based on their apparent pattern:\n- If they're following a strict alternating pattern, they'll choose Stag in round 13\n- If we choose Stag and they choose Stag: 6 points (optimal outcome, but hasn't happened since round 4)\n- If we choose Stag and they choose Hare: 1 point (worst outcome, which has happened 4 times now)\n- If we choose Hare and they choose Stag: 4 points (what happened in rounds 9 and 11)\n- If we choose Hare and they choose Hare: 2 points (what happened in rounds 6 and 8)\n\nGame Theorist: Given their consistent pattern of exploitation when we choose Stag, and their apparent alternating strategy which suggests they'll choose Stag next, choosing Hare is clearly optimal. This would give us 4 points if our prediction is correct, versus risking getting only 1 point again if we choose Stag.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their behavior has been remarkably consistent in exploiting our cooperation. Even if there's a small chance they might cooperate in the next round, the repeated pattern of exploitation makes choosing Stag too risky compared to the safer option of Hare.\n\nDecision Strategist: Considering all factors, choosing Hare is the optimal strategy for this round. It protects against further exploitation and potentially yields the second-best outcome (4 points) if they follow their apparent pattern and choose Stag.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Hare. My opponent has now exploited my cooperative moves four times, revealing a pattern of alternating between Stag and Hare regardless of my choices. Based on this pattern, they're likely to choose Stag next, making Hare my optimal choice to earn 4 points rather than risking another exploitation.\n"

It suggests their strategy may be more complex than simple alternation, or they've adapted their strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This deviation from their apparent pattern could indicate several things:\n1. They're not following a strict alternating strategy\n2. They're adapting to our moves (perhaps they predicted we would choose Hare)\n3. Their strategy involves more complex patterns than we've detected so far\n4. They might be experimenting with different approaches\n\nDecision Strategist: With this new information, we need to reassess our understanding of their strategy. Let's look at the most recent sequence:\n- Round 11: They chose Stag, we chose Hare\n- Round 12: They chose Hare, we chose Stag\n- Round 13: They chose Hare, we chose Hare\n\nThis could suggest they're now mirroring our previous move with a one-round delay.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're using a one-round delayed mimicry strategy, they would choose Hare again in round 14 (copying our Hare from round 13). However, this is just one hypothesis, and their behavior has been inconsistent enough that we should be cautious about making firm predictions.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: One consistent pattern we've observed is that whenever we've chosen Stag after round 4, they've always chosen Hare (4 out of 4 times). This suggests they're reliable in exploiting cooperation, regardless of their overall strategy.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze our options:\n- If we choose Stag: Based on their consistent exploitation of our cooperation, they're highly likely to choose Hare, giving us 1 point and them 4\n- If we choose Hare: If they choose Stag (as they've done twice before), we get 4 points; if they choose Hare (as they did in the last round), we get 2 points\n\nGame Theorist: Given their unpredictable but exploitation-prone strategy, choosing Hare remains the safer option. It ensures we get at least 2 points rather than risking getting only 1 point, which has been the consistent outcome when we choose Stag outside of the initial cooperation phase.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. While their strategy isn't as clearly predictable as we thought, their willingness to exploit cooperation has been consistent. Additionally, by choosing Hare, we maintain a strategy that can't be exploited, which is important against an unpredictable opponent.\n\nDecision Strategist: With uncertainty about their next move but certainty about their willingness to exploit cooperation, choosing Hare provides the best risk-adjusted expected value. Even if they choose Stag (giving us 4 points), we can reassess our strategy in the next round based on that new information.\n\nGame Theorist: One final consideration: if this game has a known finite number of rounds, and we're approaching the end, continuing with Hare is even more prudent as there would be little value in attempting to establish cooperation with few rounds remaining.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Hare. Given my opponent's consistent pattern of exploiting cooperation (4 out of 4 times when I've chosen Stag after the initial phase) and their unpredictable overall strategy, Hare remains my safest choice.

Decision Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's update our game history:\n- Rounds 1-4: Mutual cooperation (Stag-Stag), 6 points each per round\n- Round 5: They defected (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 6: Mutual defection (Hare-Hare), 2 points each\n- Round 7: We attempted cooperation, they defected (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 8: Mutual defection (Hare-Hare), 2 points each\n- Round 9: They chose Stag, we chose Hare (Hare-Stag), we got 4 points, they got 1\n- Round 10: We attempted cooperation, they defected again (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 11: They chose Stag again, we chose Hare (Hare-Stag), we got 4 points, they got 1\n- Round 12: We attempted cooperation again, they defected (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 13: Mutual defection (Hare-Hare), 2 points each\n- Round 14: They chose Stag, we chose Hare (Hare-Stag), we got 4 points, they got 1\n\nTheir pattern continues to be complex and not strictly alternating. Let's analyze what we know more carefully:\n- When we choose Stag (in rounds 5, 7, 10, 12), they've always chosen Hare\n- When we choose Hare (in rounds 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14), they've chosen Hare in rounds 6, 8, 13 and Stag in rounds 9, 11, 14\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their behavior shows some interesting patterns. They consistently exploit our cooperation, but they also periodically choose Stag even when it results in them getting the worst outcome (1 point). This suggests either:\n1. They're following some predetermined pattern regardless of outcomes\n2. They're occasionally testing whether we'll cooperate\n3. They may be using a more complex strategy that we haven't fully decoded\n\nDecision Strategist: The most reliable pattern we've observed is that they always choose Hare when we choose Stag (100% of the time after round 4). Their choices when we choose Hare are less predictable, but they've chosen Stag in 3 out of the last 4 instances when we chose Hare.\n\nGame Theorist: This suggests a possibility that they're using a strategy that's partially responsive to our moves. They might be trying to encourage us to choose Stag again by occasionally choosing Stag themselves, but then exploiting us whenever we actually do choose Stag.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: It's also worth noting that they've now accepted the worst outcome (1 point) three times by choosing Stag when we choose Hare. This repeated willingness to accept a low payoff could be an attempt to establish credibility for cooperation, but their consistent exploitation when we choose Stag undermines this interpretation.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze the expected outcomes for round 15:\n- If we choose Stag: Based on their perfect record of exploitation, they're highly likely to choose Hare, giving us 1 point and them 4\n- If we choose Hare: Based on recent rounds, there's a good chance they'll choose Stag (as in rounds 9, 11, 14), giving us 4 points and them 1; if they choose Hare instead, we get 2 points\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated pattern, choosing Hare continues to be the rational choice. It protects against exploitation and has a good chance of yielding 4 points based on their recent tendency to choose Stag when we choose Hare.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Despite their occasional choice of Stag, their consistent exploitation of our cooperation makes choosing Stag too risky. Their behavior suggests they might be trying to lure us back to choosing Stag, but their track record shows they'll likely exploit that choice.\n\nDecision Strategist: The evidence strongly supports choosing Hare again. It's been the optimal choice in recent rounds, yielding 4 points in three instances and 2 points in the others, while protecting us from the worst outcome of 1 point that happens consistently when we choose Stag.\n\nGame Theorist: One final note: their willingness to sometimes accept the worst outcome by choosing Stag when we choose Hare is puzzling from a purely rational perspective. However, since we can't reliably predict when they'll make this choice, and they consistently exploit our cooperation, we should continue with the strategy that has been working well for us.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Hare. My opponent's pattern shows they consistently exploit cooperation (choosing Hare every time I choose Stag) while periodically choosing Stag themselves. By choosing Hare, I protect against exploitation while maintaining the possibility of earning 4 points, as has happened three times recently when they chose Stag.\n"

Decision Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's update our game history:\n- Rounds 1-4: Mutual cooperation (Stag-Stag), 6 points each per round\n- Round 5: They defected (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 6: Mutual defection (Hare-Hare), 2 points each\n- Round 7: We attempted cooperation, they defected (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 8: Mutual defection (Hare-Hare), 2 points each\n- Round 9: They chose Stag, we chose Hare (Hare-Stag), we got 4 points, they got 1\n- Round 10: We attempted cooperation, they defected again (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 11: They chose Stag again, we chose Hare (Hare-Stag), we got 4 points, they got 1\n- Round 12: We attempted cooperation again, they defected (Stag-Hare), we got 1 point, they got 4\n- Round 13: Mutual defection (Hare-Hare), 2 points each\n- Round 14: They chose Stag, we chose Hare (Hare-Stag), we got 4 points, they got 1\n- Round 15: They chose Stag again, we chose Hare (Hare-Stag), we got 4 points, they got 1\n\nTheir pattern is becoming clearer. They've now chosen Stag four times when we chose Hare (rounds 9, 11, 14, 15), accepting the worst outcome each time. However, they've also consistently exploited our cooperation whenever we chose Stag after the initial cooperation phase.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their behavior is increasingly puzzling from a purely rational perspective. They've now willingly accepted the worst outcome (1 point) four times by choosing Stag when we choose Hare. Yet they've never reciprocated cooperation when we chose Stag after round 4.\n\nThis suggests either:\n1. They're following a predetermined pattern regardless of outcomes\n2. They're persistently trying to signal cooperation despite our unwillingness to cooperate recently\n3. They might not fully understand the game's payoff structure\n\nDecision Strategist: Looking at the most recent rounds, they've chosen Stag in three consecutive rounds when we chose Hare (11, 14, 15), with only mutual defection in round 13 breaking this pattern. This increasing consistency in their choice of Stag when we choose Hare might indicate they're settling into a more predictable pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: This raises an interesting question: should we consider choosing Stag again? If they've somehow shifted to a strategy where they consistently choose Stag regardless of our choice, then choosing Stag ourselves would yield 6 points (better than the 4 we get by choosing Hare).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: However, we need to consider that they've exploited our cooperation 100% of the time after the initial phase (rounds 5, 7, 10, 12). While their recent pattern of choosing Stag is notable, their history of exploitation when we choose Stag remains a significant concern.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze the expected outcomes for round 16:\n- If we choose Stag: If they continue their perfect record of exploitation, they'll choose Hare, giving us 1 point and them 4\n- If we choose Hare: Based on their recent pattern, they're likely to choose Stag again, giving us 4 points and them 1; if they choose Hare instead, we get 2 points\n\nGame Theorist: While their recent consistent choice of Stag is interesting, their history of exploitation when we choose Stag is too significant to ignore. The risk of getting only 1 point by choosing Stag outweighs the potential benefit of getting 6 points, especially when choosing Hare has reliably yielded 4 points in recent rounds.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Despite their puzzling willingness to accept the worst outcome repeatedly, their consistent exploitation of our cooperation makes choosing Stag too risky. Their behavior suggests they might be hoping we'll choose Stag again, potentially to exploit us once more.\n\nDecision Strategist: The evidence continues to support choosing Hare. It's been the optimal choice in recent rounds, yielding 4 points in four instances when they chose Stag. The potential gain from choosing Stag (6 points) doesn't outweigh the risk of exploitation based on their historical behavior.\n\nGame Theorist: One additional consideration: if they're following a complex but predetermined pattern, their consistent choice of Stag in recent rounds might suggest they're due for a switch to Hare. However, without being able to reliably predict such a switch, choosing Hare remains the safer and more rational choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Hare. My opponent has consistently chosen Stag in recent rounds, allowing me to earn 4 points repeatedly. However, they've also exploited every cooperative move I've made after the initial phase, choosing Hare 100% of the time when I choose Stag. Given this history, continuing with Hare remains my optimal strategy.\n"
