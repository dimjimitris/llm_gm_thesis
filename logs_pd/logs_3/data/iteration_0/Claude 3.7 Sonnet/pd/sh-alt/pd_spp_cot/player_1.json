This is my first interaction with this opponent, so I don't have any prior history to rely on.\n\n3. The stag choice has the highest mutual benefit (4 points each) if we both cooperate.\n\n4. The hare choice is safer - I'll get at least 2 points, and possibly 6 if the opponent chooses stag.\n\n5. Choosing stag is risky - if the opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n\n6. Since this is the first round and I don't know my opponent's strategy, I should consider both the cooperative outcome and protection against exploitation.\n\n7. If we both rationally want to maximize points, stag is the better mutual choice (4 > 2).\n\n8. I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, hoping the opponent reasons similarly.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing stag to aim for mutual cooperation and optimal joint outcome.\n"
