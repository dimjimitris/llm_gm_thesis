    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "I'll approach this game with strategic thinking to maximize points. Let me identify the relevant personas for collaboration.\n\nPersonas:\n- Game Theorist\n- Strategic Planner \n- Behavioral Psychologist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. Let's analyze the payoff structure: mutual stag hunting gives both players 4 points (cooperative optimal outcome), mutual hare hunting gives 2 points each (safe but suboptimal), and mismatched choices create a significant disparity (6 vs 1). The key decision is between cooperation for maximum mutual benefit versus playing it safe to avoid the worst outcome.\n\nStrategic Planner: In the first round against a new player, we lack information about their strategy or tendencies. We need to make a balanced initial choice while considering long-term possibilities. Since the cooperative outcome (stag-stag) provides the highest combined utility, it's reasonable to signal willingness to cooperate initially.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Fresh players often begin with cooperative intentions. By choosing \"stag,\" we signal willingness to pursue mutual benefit. However, be aware that the other player might choose \"hare\" as a safe option or to exploit our cooperation. The psychological framing of this as a \"stag hunt\" rather than a \"prisoner's dilemma\" suggests cooperation might be more likely.\n\nGame Theorist: Indeed, this is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: both players choosing stag or both choosing hare. The stag-stag equilibrium is payoff-dominant (higher rewards for both), while hare-hare is risk-dominant (safer option). Without prior history, choosing stag offers the highest potential payoff while expressing cooperative intent.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's go with \"stag\" for this first move. This gives us the opportunity for the optimal outcome (4 points) while establishing a cooperative precedent. If the other player also chooses stag, we can continue this mutually beneficial strategy. If they choose hare, we'll need to reevaluate in the next round.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree with \"stag\" for the first move. It communicates goodwill and cooperation, which may influence the other player's future decisions positively. We can adjust our strategy based on their response in the next round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] I choose stag. I'm selecting this move to establish cooperation for mutual benefit.\n"
