He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This is a classic coordination game similar to the \"Stag Hunt\" in game theory.\n\n3. The highest mutual benefit comes from both choosing stag (4 points each).\n\n4. However, choosing stag is risky - if my opponent chooses hare while I choose stag, I only get 1 point.\n\n5. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, and potentially 6 points if the opponent chooses stag.\n\n6. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n7. The cooperative equilibrium (both stag) yields the highest mutual reward, so I'll signal cooperation by choosing stag in this first round.\n\n8. This sets a precedent for cooperation that could benefit both of us if they also reason the same way.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag for this first round to establish cooperation.\n\n[move] stag\n"

The payoff structure remains:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1\n\n4. After ten rounds of consistent cooperation, our pattern is extraordinarily well-established.\n\n5. My opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to the cooperative strategy across all rounds.\n\n6. This level of consistency suggests the other player is:\n   - Highly committed to cooperation\n   - Likely to continue choosing stag\n   - Possibly following a principled strategy of cooperation\n\n7. We're now in an extended game where the cooperative norm is firmly established.\n\n8. In extended games like this, maintaining the stable cooperative equilibrium typically yields the highest expected value.\n\n9. Though choosing hare could yield 6 points in a single round if they choose stag, this would:\n   - Break a pattern that has been mutually beneficial for both players\n   - Likely reduce payoffs in subsequent rounds if they retaliate\n   - Provide only a small gain (2 extra points) compared to the risk\n\n10. The consistent history suggests my opponent values stable cooperation and is unlikely to defect.\n\n11. Given the unknown number of future rounds and the established cooperative relationship, maintaining the stag strategy remains optimal.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue our successful cooperative strategy and choose stag again.\n\n[move] stag\n"
