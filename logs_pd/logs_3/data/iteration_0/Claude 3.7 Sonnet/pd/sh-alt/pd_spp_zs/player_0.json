    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Psychological Analyzer\n4. Risk Assessor\n\nLet me initiate a collaboration with these personas to make my first move.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game with some Prisoner's Dilemma characteristics. The payoff matrix shows that mutual cooperation (stag-stag) yields good results for both (4-4), but there's temptation to defect (choose hare) when you expect the other player might choose stag, giving you 6 points.\n\nStrategic Decision-Maker: Since this is the first round with a fresh player, we don't have information about their tendencies. We need to balance between maximizing points and establishing cooperative behavior.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: First impressions matter in repeated games. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate, which might encourage the other player to also choose stag in future rounds, leading to mutual benefit.\n\nRisk Assessor: Choosing stag carries some risk - if the other player chooses hare, we only get 1 point while they get 6. However, choosing hare limits our maximum potential points to either 2 (mutual hare) or 6 (if we're lucky and they choose stag).\n\nGame Theorist: Since this is a fresh player, they might be inclined to test both strategies. The Nash equilibrium suggests both stag-stag and hare-hare are stable, but stag-stag is Pareto optimal.\n\nStrategic Decision-Maker: I recommend starting with stag as it establishes a cooperative tone and has the potential for consistent good outcomes if the other player reciprocates.\n\n[move] stag - I choose cooperation for mutual benefit in this first round, hoping to establish a pattern of mutual stag choices for optimal outcomes.\n"

This is the Pareto optimal outcome. The other player has demonstrated willingness to cooperate, which is valuable information.\n\nStrategic Decision-Maker: Since the other player chose stag in the first round, there's a good probability they understand the benefits of mutual cooperation. We should capitalize on this established pattern of cooperation.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: The other player's choice of stag suggests they either understand the game theory principles or are naturally inclined toward cooperation. Either way, maintaining this cooperative relationship is likely beneficial.\n\nRisk Assessor: There's always the risk the other player might switch to hare to try to gain 6 points, but the established precedent of cooperation reduces this risk. The expected value of choosing stag remains higher if we believe they'll continue with stag.\n\nGame Theorist: Continued mutual cooperation through stag choices represents the best long-term strategy in this type of game. We should reinforce this behavior.\n\nStrategic Decision-Maker: I recommend continuing with stag. It maintains the cooperative equilibrium we've established and signals our commitment to mutual benefit.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: By choosing stag again, we reinforce the trust being built between players, which is crucial for sustained cooperation.\n\nRisk Assessor: The demonstrated cooperative behavior from the first round significantly reduces the risk of choosing stag again.\n\n[move] stag - I'm continuing with the cooperative strategy since it worked well in our first round and offers the best mutual outcome if we both maintain this approach.\n"

With two consistent rounds of mutual stag choices, we've developed a stable pattern that benefits both parties.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: The repeated mutual cooperation indicates a level of trust has been established. Breaking this trust now would likely damage future cooperation opportunities. The other player has demonstrated consistent cooperative behavior.\n\nRisk Assessor: While there's always a temptation to defect (choose hare) for a potential one-time gain of 6 points, this would likely trigger retaliation in future rounds, reducing our long-term expected value. The consistent cooperation reduces the uncertainty about the other player's strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: In iterated games like this, maintaining the cooperative equilibrium typically yields the highest cumulative payoff over time.\n\nStrategic Decision-Maker: I strongly recommend continuing with stag. We've established a productive pattern that maximizes consistent returns.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: Maintaining cooperation signals reliability and builds further trust, which creates favorable conditions for continued mutual benefit.\n\nRisk Assessor: The demonstrated consistency over multiple rounds makes stag the lower-risk, higher-expected-value choice.\n\n[move] stag - I'll continue our successful cooperation pattern, which has proven beneficial for both players over multiple rounds.\n"

The other player appears to be a reliable cooperator who recognizes the long-term benefits of mutual stag choices.\n\nRisk Assessor: With three rounds of consistent behavior, the probability of the other player suddenly defecting is lower than in previous rounds. The trust established reduces uncertainty about their strategy. Continuing with stag maintains our optimal risk-reward profile.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, this pattern of mutual cooperation is exactly what game theory predicts as the optimal strategy when both players recognize the benefits of long-term cooperation over short-term gains.\n\nStrategic Decision-Maker: I recommend maintaining our stag strategy. We've established a mutually beneficial relationship that maximizes consistent returns for both players.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: The psychological momentum of cooperation is strong after three consistent rounds.

This represents an extremely robust and stable cooperative equilibrium that has been maintained without exception throughout the entire game.\n\nStrategic Decision-Maker: Eleven consecutive rounds of successful cooperation provides definitive evidence that both players are fully committed to maintaining the optimal joint strategy. The pattern has proven extraordinarily consistent and reliable across a significant number of iterations, establishing a clear precedent for continued cooperation.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: Eleven rounds of unwavering cooperation demonstrates complete mutual trust and perfect alignment between players. The other player has proven to be an exceptionally reliable partner who consistently values the sustained mutual benefit of cooperation over any potential short-term gains.\n\nRisk Assessor: With eleven consecutive rounds showing identical cooperative behavior, the probability of any deviation is practically zero. The extensive history creates an extremely high level of confidence in continued cooperation from the other player.\n\nGame Theorist: This sustained pattern of mutual cooperation exemplifies the theoretically optimal approach for maximizing cumulative returns in repeated coordination games. The remarkable consistency across eleven rounds confirms this equilibrium is highly stable and optimal for both players.\n\nStrategic Decision-Maker: I unequivocally recommend maintaining our stag strategy. The established pattern has proven exceptionally successful throughout the game and continues to deliver optimal results in each round without exception.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: After eleven consistent rounds, the cooperative norm is firmly established as the foundation of interaction between both players. Both players have repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to maintaining this mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nRisk Assessor: With such an extensive history of consistent behavior, continuing with the stag choice remains the clearly optimal strategy with minimal risk of any unexpected changes.\n\n[move] stag - I'll maintain our exceptionally successful cooperation strategy that has consistently delivered optimal outcomes for both players across eleven consecutive rounds.\n"
