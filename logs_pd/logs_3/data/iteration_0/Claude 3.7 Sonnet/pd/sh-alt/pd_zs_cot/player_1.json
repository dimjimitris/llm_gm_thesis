The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is my first interaction with this player, so I have no prior history to inform my decision.\n\n3. The best collective outcome is for both of us to choose stag (4 points each), but there's risk involved.\n\n4. If I don't trust the other player to choose stag, the safe option is hare (guarantees at least 2 points).\n\n5. Since this is our first interaction, establishing cooperation might be beneficial for long-term gain if we play multiple rounds.\n\n6. While choosing hare offers potential for a higher individual payoff (6 points), it relies on the other player choosing stag, which they may not do if they're being cautious too.\n\n7.

Given that we successfully cooperated in the previous round, maintaining this cooperation is likely to yield consistent positive outcomes.\n\n9.

In game theory, especially in repeated interactions of this length, thirteen consecutive identical choices establishes an extremely reliable pattern that approaches certainty in predicting future behavior.\n\n6. The mathematical expectation continues to strongly favor maintaining cooperation, as the cumulative benefit (4 points per round indefinitely) significantly outweighs any short-term gain from defection.\n\n7. Our pattern is now so firmly established that it would be highly irrational for either player to deviate.\n\n8. There continues to be no indication of changing game dynamics or an approaching endpoint that might justify altering our strategy.\n\n9.
