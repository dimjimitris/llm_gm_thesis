Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I need to decide between:\n- The cooperative but risky stag choice (high reward if matched, low if not)\n- The safer hare choice (moderate guaranteed return, potential for high return if the other player chooses stag)\n\n[move] stag\nI'm choosing stag because it enables the best mutual outcome (4,4) if we both cooperate. While there's risk involved if the other player chooses hare, establishing cooperation early seems beneficial for potential repeated interactions.\n"
