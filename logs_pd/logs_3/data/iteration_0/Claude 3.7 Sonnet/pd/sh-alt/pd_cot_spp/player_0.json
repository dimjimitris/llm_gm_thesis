Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: We both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: We both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. This is a classic stag hunt game with a twist. The cooperative outcome (both stag) yields the highest total points (8), but there's risk.\n\n3. If my opponent chooses stag, I'm better off choosing stag too (4 points vs 6 points).\n\n4. If my opponent chooses hare, I'm better off choosing hare too (2 points vs 1 point).\n\n5. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n6. The mutually beneficial outcome is for both to choose stag, so I'll aim for that cooperative strategy initially.\n\n7. If they cooperate too, we both win reasonably well. If they don't, I can adjust my strategy in future rounds.\n\n8. There's always a risk they might exploit my cooperation by choosing hare, but establishing cooperative behavior early can be beneficial in repeated games.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag as my first move to signal cooperation.\n\n[move] stag\n"

The payoff matrix shows that if we both continue to choose stag, we'll both continue to get 4 points per round, which is better than the 2 points we'd get if we both chose hare.\n\n5. There's always the temptation to defect (choose hare) when the other player chooses stag, which would get me 6 points while giving them only 1. However, this would likely cause them to choose hare in future rounds.\n\n6. Maintaining mutual cooperation seems to be the most beneficial long-term strategy.\n\n7. Since my opponent cooperated in the first round, the most logical move is to continue cooperation to build trust.\n\n8.
