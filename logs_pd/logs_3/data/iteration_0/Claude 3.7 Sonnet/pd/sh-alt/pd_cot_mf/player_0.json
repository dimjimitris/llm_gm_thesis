Let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: We both get 4 points (cooperative outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: We both get 2 points (safe but suboptimal)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points (I lose badly)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point (I win big)\n\n2. This is a coordination game with risk-reward tradeoffs. The cooperative outcome (stag-stag) is better than the safe outcome (hare-hare).\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I don't know their tendencies. They might:\n   - Play cooperatively hoping for mutual benefit (stag)\n   - Play safe to avoid the worst outcome (hare)\n   - Try to exploit me if they think I'll play stag\n\n4. The highest mutual benefit comes from both choosing stag (4 points each).\n\n5. However, choosing stag is risky - if they choose hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\n6. In the first round, I should signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, while understanding it's a risk.\n\n7. I'll choose stag to establish a cooperative precedent, hoping they see the mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing stag to aim for the optimal mutual outcome where we both receive 4 points each.\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - Seven consecutive rounds of mutual hare choices\n   - 100% exploitation rate when I've chosen stag after the first round\n\n3. Current point totals:\n   - Me: 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 20 points\n   - Opponent: 4 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 30 points\n\n4. After ten total rounds with extremely consistent behavior patterns, it seems certain that:\n   - The opponent will choose hare if I choose stag\n   - The opponent will choose hare if I choose hare\n\n5. This has been an unusually long game with persistent strategy from both players.\n\n6. At this point, with such overwhelming evidence of the opponent's strategy, the decision matrix is clear:\n   - If I choose stag: Almost certainly get 1 point (based on historical evidence)\n   - If I choose hare: Almost certainly get 2 points (based on historical evidence)\n\n7. While in theory mutual cooperation would benefit both players, the opponent has demonstrated no willingness to cooperate after the initial round.\n\n8. Given the length of the game and consistency of behavior, there is no rational reason to deviate from the established pattern.\n\n[move] hare - Maintaining the stable strategy that consistently yields 2 points per round, as seven consecutive rounds of mutual hare choices and multiple instances of exploitation when choosing stag provide overwhelming evidence this is the optimal choice.\n"
