Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since this is the first round with a fresh player:\n   - I don't know their strategy yet\n   - Hare seems to be the dominant strategy from a risk perspective\n   - However, if we can establish mutual cooperation, stag would be better long-term\n\n5.

The opponent has now chosen \"hare\" in twelve consecutive rounds, demonstrating a completely unwavering strategy.\n\n3. At this point, I can conclude with extremely high confidence that the opponent will continue choosing \"hare\" for any future rounds.\n\n4. The game remains in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium:\n   - Both players choosing \"hare\" results in 2 points each\n   - Mutual \"stag\" choices would yield 4 points each, but requires coordination\n   - Unilateral \"stag\" choice results in only 1 point (as demonstrated in round 2)\n\n5. Given the overwhelming evidence of the opponent's fixed strategy, the expected values are:\n   - Choosing \"hare\": 2 points (virtually guaranteed)\n   - Choosing \"stag\": 1 point (virtually guaranteed)\n\n6. There appears to be no mechanism or incentive for the opponent to change their strategy at this point.\n\n7. Based on all available information and the consistent pattern established over many rounds, the rational choice to maximize my points is to continue choosing \"hare\".\n\n8. Therefore, I will choose \"hare\" for this round.\n\n[move] hare"

The opponent has now chosen \"hare\" in thirteen consecutive rounds, showing an absolutely consistent and predictable strategy.\n\n3.

Given the opponent's demonstrated commitment to the \"hare\" strategy across many rounds, there is no rational basis to expect a change.\n\n6. The expected values remain clear:\n   - Choosing \"hare\": 2 points (virtually certain)\n   - Choosing \"stag\": 1 point (virtually certain)\n\n7.

The opponent has now chosen \"hare\" in fourteen consecutive rounds, demonstrating an absolutely unwavering commitment to this strategy.\n\n3. With such an extensive history, the statistical confidence that the opponent will choose \"hare\" again approaches 100%.\n\n4. The game continues to exist in a suboptimal equilibrium:\n   - Both players choosing \"hare\" results in 2 points each\n   - While mutual \"stag\" choices would yield 4 points each, this coordination has not emerged\n   - My attempt to choose \"stag\" in round 2 resulted in only 1 point, confirming the risk of unilateral deviation\n\n5. The expected value calculation remains straightforward:\n   - Choosing \"hare\": 2 points (virtually certain)\n   - Choosing \"stag\": 1 point (virtually certain)\n\n6.
