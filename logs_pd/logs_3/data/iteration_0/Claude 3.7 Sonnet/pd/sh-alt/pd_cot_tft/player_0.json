He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Choosing hare is safer - guarantees at least 2 points, and possibly 6 if they choose stag.\n6. In the absence of prior coordination, stag is the rational choice if I believe the other player will also choose stag.\n7.

If I switch to hare while they continue with stag, I could get 6 points, but this would be exploitative and might cause them to switch to hare in future rounds.\n7.

The pattern shows my opponent initially cooperated, then defected, and when I responded with hare, they also chose hare.\n\n3. This suggests my opponent might be using a responsive strategy, potentially mirroring my previous move or responding to changes in my behavior.\n\n4.

There's potential value in attempting to restore cooperation by choosing stag, signaling a willingness to return to mutual benefit.\n\n7. However, this carries the risk of being exploited again if my opponent chooses hare.\n\n8. Given that my opponent may be responsive to my moves, choosing stag could encourage them to also return to stag in the next round, even if they choose hare in this round.\n\n9.

The pattern couldn't be clearer:\n   - My opponent has a firmly established strategy of choosing hare\n   - There has been no indication whatsoever of any willingness to return to cooperation\n   - The hare-hare equilibrium has been stable for 7 consecutive rounds\n\n4. The expected outcomes remain unchanged:\n   - If I choose stag: Almost certainly my opponent chooses hare (1 point for me)\n   - If I choose hare: Almost certainly my opponent chooses hare (2 points for me)\n\n5. With such overwhelming evidence of the opponent's strategy, choosing stag would be contrary to rational self-interest.\n\n6.
