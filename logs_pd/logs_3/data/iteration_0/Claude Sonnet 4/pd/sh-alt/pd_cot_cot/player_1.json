Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - If I choose stag: I either get 4 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 1 point (if opponent chooses hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I either get 6 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 2 points (if opponent chooses hare)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not have a clear strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with intuition\n   - Fresh players often choose more cautiously or cooperatively initially\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing hare gives me a chance at 6 points (the highest possible) but risks only getting 2 points\n   - Choosing stag gives me a safer 4 points if opponent cooperates, but only 1 point if they don't\n   - The expected value depends on predicting opponent behavior\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against a fresh player who might lean toward cooperation, stag could yield mutual benefit (4 points each)\n   - However, hare offers the highest potential payoff (6 points) if the opponent chooses stag\n   - Since this is the first interaction with a fresh player, they might choose stag thinking cooperatively\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare to maximize my potential points, anticipating the fresh player might choose stag.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Evaluate the strategic opportunity:\n   - If my opponent continues with hare (which seems likely given the pattern), and I switch to stag, I only get 1 point while they get 6\n   - If my opponent switches to stag expecting me to continue with hare, and I also switch to stag, we both get 4 points\n   - If I stick with hare and they stick with hare, we get 2 points again\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown strong commitment to hare over two rounds\n   - Breaking this pattern by choosing stag when they likely choose hare again would be costly (1 point vs their 6)\n   - However, if they're thinking the same way I am, they might switch to stag expecting me to switch\n   - Given their consistent behavior, the safer assumption is they'll choose hare again\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag this time, betting that the opponent might finally switch to stag as well, giving us both 4 points instead of the repeated 2 points.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Consider the mathematical certainty:\n   - Nine consecutive hare choices approaches statistical certainty for round 10\n   - Against a guaranteed hare player, hare gives me 2 points vs 1 point for stag\n   - This is a 100% advantage for choosing hare\n\n4. Evaluate any remaining uncertainty:\n   - The probability they'll switch after 9 identical choices is virtually zero\n   - Even if they were thinking of switching, they've had 8 opportunities since round 1\n   - Their behavior suggests they may not even be considering alternatives\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - At this point, choosing anything other than hare would be irrational\n   - The opponent has provided me with perfect information about their strategy\n   - I should exploit this predictability by playing optimally against it\n   - The 5-point deficit is entirely from my round 3 mistake, not from the current strategy\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare again, as the opponent has given me nine rounds of evidence that they will always choose hare, making this the mathematically optimal choice.\n\n[move] hare\n"
