First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where cooperation (stag) gives mutual benefit, but defection (hare) can give higher individual rewards if the opponent cooperates.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to consider what they might do:\n   - They might not understand the optimal strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or based on intuition\n   - They might be risk-averse and choose the \"safer\" option\n\n4. Analyzing the risk vs reward:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 4 points (if they choose stag), worst case 1 point (if they choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 6 points (if they choose stag), worst case 2 points (if they choose hare)\n\n5. Since the opponent is fresh/new, they might be more likely to choose hare as it guarantees at least 2 points and has potential for 6 points. This makes hare the safer choice for them.\n\n6. Given this reasoning, choosing hare gives me the better expected outcome against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] hare\n"

This tells me something about my opponent:\n   - They also chose the \"safer\" option of hare\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me about risk management\n   - They could be playing cautiously as a fresh player\n\n3. Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with hare since it worked (got them points safely)\n   - They might think I'll stick with hare and try to exploit that with stag to get 6 points\n   - They might try to cooperate this time and choose stag, hoping I do the same for mutual 4 points\n\n4. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 4 points (better than last round)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (worse than last round)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 6 points (much better)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 points (same as last round)\n\n5. Since we both played conservatively last round, there's a chance they might try to be more cooperative this round and choose stag. However, there's also a chance they'll stick with the \"safe\" hare strategy.\n\n6. Given the uncertainty and that hare still provides a decent floor (2 points) with upside potential (6 points), I'll stick with the safer strategy.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Pattern analysis from previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: Both chose hare (2 points each)\n   - Round 2: Both chose hare (2 points each)\n   - My opponent has consistently chosen hare for 2 rounds\n\n2.

If my opponent continues this pattern and chooses hare again:\n   - If I choose hare: 2 points (same as before)\n   - If I choose stag: 1 point (worse outcome for me)\n\n4. However, if my opponent decides to switch to stag (thinking I'll choose hare):\n   - If I choose hare: 6 points (excellent outcome)\n   - If I choose stag: 4 points (good mutual cooperation)\n\n5.

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They finally switched strategies after two rounds of hare\n   - They might have been trying to cooperate by choosing stag\n   - They took a risk hoping I would also choose stag for mutual 4 points\n   - They got punished with only 1 point for this attempt\n\n3. Predicting opponent's next move:\n   - They just got burned badly (1 point vs my 6 points)\n   - They might feel betrayed or frustrated by the cooperation attempt failing\n   - They could revert back to the safe hare strategy\n   - Or they might try stag again, thinking I'll now cooperate since I \"won\" last round\n   - They might also choose hare thinking I'll try stag to reciprocate cooperation\n\n4. My strategic options:\n   - If they choose hare (likely after getting burned): hare gives me 2, stag gives me 1\n   - If they choose stag (possible cooperation attempt): hare gives me 6, stag gives me 4\n\n5.

Maximum pattern entrenchment:\n   - This is now beyond stable - it's become automatic\n   - Eight consecutive rounds of hare after punishment shows complete behavioral conditioning\n   - The opponent has essentially eliminated stag from their decision-making process\n   - We've achieved the most predictable state possible in this game\n\n3. Behavioral psychology insight:\n   - The opponent has been reinforced with consistent 2-point rewards for 8 straight rounds\n   - Their single deviation resulted in severe punishment (1 point while I got 6)\n   - This creates powerful negative conditioning against ever choosing stag again\n   - They've found their \"comfort zone\" and have no reason to leave it\n\n4. My dominant position:\n   - Total points: 26 (2\u00d711 rounds + 6 from round 4)\n   - I maintain a crushing lead built on that pivotal round 4 advantage\n   - The stable pattern ensures I can coast to victory\n\n5. Probability calculation:\n   - Chance opponent chooses hare: 99.9%+\n   - Twelve rounds of data with only one deviation (which was punished) creates near-certainty\n   - The psychological momentum is overwhelmingly toward hare\n\n6. Decision analysis:\n   - Against hare (absolute near-certainty): hare=2 points, stag=1 point\n   - Against stag (statistically negligible): hare=6 points, stag=4 points\n   - Hare is the only rational choice\n\nThe game has reached absolute predictability.

Reinforcement psychology:\n   - The opponent has been rewarded with 2 points for 10 straight rounds\n   - Their risk-taking attempt 10 rounds ago resulted in catastrophic failure (1 point vs my 6)\n   - This creates the strongest possible conditioning against deviation\n   - They've found what behaviorists call a \"superstitious\" pattern - they believe hare = success\n\n4.

Evaluate whether to try breaking the pattern:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare (very likely): I get 1, they get 6\n   - This would increase their lead to 9 points - making things much worse\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare (almost certain): We both get 2\n   - The only way I could gain ground is if they suddenly switched to stag, but they've shown zero indication of doing so\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - With 5 consecutive hare choices, the opponent appears to have a pure hare strategy\n   - Trying to exploit this with stag has already failed once and would likely fail again\n   - My best strategy against a pure hare player is to also play pure hare\n   - This prevents them from gaining more ground and keeps us tied in each round going forward\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare again to match their clearly established pattern and avoid falling further behind.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's extremely consistent behavior:\n   - They have chosen hare in ALL six rounds - a perfect 100% hare strategy\n   - This level of consistency strongly indicates they will continue choosing hare\n   - Their strategy appears to be completely fixed and predictable\n\n3. Consider if there's any reason to deviate:\n   - The 5-point gap remains constant when we both choose hare\n   - If I choose stag against their likely hare: I get 1, they get 6 (gap becomes 9 points)\n   - If I choose hare against their likely hare: I get 2, they get 2 (gap stays at 5 points)\n   - There's virtually no upside to choosing stag given their pattern\n\n4. Evaluate long-term strategy:\n   - At this point, the opponent has established an extremely predictable pattern\n   - My best response to a pure hare strategy is also pure hare\n   - This prevents the gap from widening and maximizes my points per round\n   - Any attempt to \"outsmart\" them with stag will likely backfire\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Six consecutive hare choices represent an overwhelmingly strong pattern\n   - The opponent appears committed to this strategy regardless of outcomes\n   - My optimal counter-strategy is to mirror their choice for consistent 2-point rounds\n   - This is a classic case where the best response to a predictable opponent is to play optimally against their known strategy\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare again to maintain the 2-2 split and prevent falling further behind against this highly predictable opponent.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
