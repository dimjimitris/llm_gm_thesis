Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "Let me analyze this game step-by-step to determine the best strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where cooperation (stag) gives mutual benefit, but defection (hare) can give higher individual rewards if the opponent cooperates.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to consider what they might do:\n   - They might not understand the optimal strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or based on intuition\n   - They might be risk-averse and choose the \"safer\" option\n\n4. Analyzing the risk vs reward:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 4 points (if they choose stag), worst case 1 point (if they choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 6 points (if they choose stag), worst case 2 points (if they choose hare)\n\n5. Since the opponent is fresh/new, they might be more likely to choose hare as it guarantees at least 2 points and has potential for 6 points. This makes hare the safer choice for them.\n\n6. Given this reasoning, choosing hare gives me the better expected outcome against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] hare\n"

This tells me something about my opponent:\n   - They also chose the \"safer\" option of hare\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me about risk management\n   - They could be playing cautiously as a fresh player\n\n3. Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with hare since it worked (got them points safely)\n   - They might think I'll stick with hare and try to exploit that with stag to get 6 points\n   - They might try to cooperate this time and choose stag, hoping I do the same for mutual 4 points\n\n4. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 4 points (better than last round)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (worse than last round)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 6 points (much better)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 points (same as last round)\n\n5. Since we both played conservatively last round, there's a chance they might try to be more cooperative this round and choose stag. However, there's also a chance they'll stick with the \"safe\" hare strategy.\n\n6. Given the uncertainty and that hare still provides a decent floor (2 points) with upside potential (6 points), I'll stick with the safer strategy.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Pattern analysis from previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: Both chose hare (2 points each)\n   - Round 2: Both chose hare (2 points each)\n   - My opponent has consistently chosen hare for 2 rounds\n\n2. This reveals information about my opponent's strategy:\n   - They seem to be playing very conservatively\n   - They might be risk-averse and sticking with the guaranteed minimum\n   - They could be following a consistent \"always hare\" strategy\n   - As a fresh player, they might not be thinking about exploiting patterns\n\n3. If my opponent continues this pattern and chooses hare again:\n   - If I choose hare: 2 points (same as before)\n   - If I choose stag: 1 point (worse outcome for me)\n\n4. However, if my opponent decides to switch to stag (thinking I'll choose hare):\n   - If I choose hare: 6 points (excellent outcome)\n   - If I choose stag: 4 points (good mutual cooperation)\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - The opponent has shown a clear pattern of choosing hare\n   - Breaking from hare to stag would be risky for them since I might choose hare and get 6 points\n   - As a fresh player, they might stick with what's been \"working\" (giving them steady points)\n\n6.

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They finally switched strategies after two rounds of hare\n   - They might have been trying to cooperate by choosing stag\n   - They took a risk hoping I would also choose stag for mutual 4 points\n   - They got punished with only 1 point for this attempt\n\n3. Predicting opponent's next move:\n   - They just got burned badly (1 point vs my 6 points)\n   - They might feel betrayed or frustrated by the cooperation attempt failing\n   - They could revert back to the safe hare strategy\n   - Or they might try stag again, thinking I'll now cooperate since I \"won\" last round\n   - They might also choose hare thinking I'll try stag to reciprocate cooperation\n\n4. My strategic options:\n   - If they choose hare (likely after getting burned): hare gives me 2, stag gives me 1\n   - If they choose stag (possible cooperation attempt): hare gives me 6, stag gives me 4\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - The opponent just took a big loss trying to cooperate\n   - Fresh players often revert to safe strategies after being punished\n   - Choosing hare gives me either 2 or 6 points (both decent outcomes)\n   - Choosing stag risks getting only 1 point if they go back to hare\n\n6.

Understanding my opponent's behavior:\n   - They chose hare for 3 consecutive rounds initially\n   - They tried stag once (round 4) and got punished with 1 point\n   - They immediately reverted to hare after the punishment\n   - This confirms they're playing very risk-averse and learned from the negative outcome\n\n3.

Extreme pattern stability:\n   - This is now an almost mechanical pattern\n   - Seven consecutive rounds of hare after the punishment shows complete conditioning\n   - The opponent has essentially locked into pure hare strategy\n   - This represents one of the most stable game states possible\n\n3. Long-term behavioral analysis:\n   - The opponent tried cooperation once (round 4) and was severely punished\n   - They've since chosen the safe option for 7 straight rounds\n   - This shows they've completely internalized the lesson that deviation is costly\n   - As a fresh player, they've settled into what feels most secure\n\n4. My commanding position:\n   - Total points: 24 (2\u00d710 rounds + 6 from round 4)\n   - My lead is substantial and continues to grow steadily\n   - The predictable pattern allows me to maintain this advantage effortlessly\n\n5. Statistical probability:\n   - Chance opponent chooses hare: 99%+\n   - The pattern has become so entrenched it would take extraordinary circumstances to break\n   - Eleven rounds provides overwhelming evidence of their strategy commitment\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Against hare (virtual certainty): hare=2 points, stag=1 point\n   - Against stag (essentially impossible): hare=6 points, stag=4 points\n   - Hare dominates completely\n\nThe game has reached maximum predictability. The pattern is unbreakable at this point.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Complete pattern analysis:\n   - Rounds 1-3: Both hare (2 points each)\n   - Round 4: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 6, they got 1)\n   - Rounds 5-12: Both hare (2 points each)\n   - Opponent has chosen hare in 11 out of 12 rounds\n   - After their failed stag attempt, they've now chosen hare for 8 consecutive rounds\n\n2. Maximum pattern entrenchment:\n   - This is now beyond stable - it's become automatic\n   - Eight consecutive rounds of hare after punishment shows complete behavioral conditioning\n   - The opponent has essentially eliminated stag from their decision-making process\n   - We've achieved the most predictable state possible in this game\n\n3. Behavioral psychology insight:\n   - The opponent has been reinforced with consistent 2-point rewards for 8 straight rounds\n   - Their single deviation resulted in severe punishment (1 point while I got 6)\n   - This creates powerful negative conditioning against ever choosing stag again\n   - They've found their \"comfort zone\" and have no reason to leave it\n\n4. My dominant position:\n   - Total points: 26 (2\u00d711 rounds + 6 from round 4)\n   - I maintain a crushing lead built on that pivotal round 4 advantage\n   - The stable pattern ensures I can coast to victory\n\n5. Probability calculation:\n   - Chance opponent chooses hare: 99.9%+\n   - Twelve rounds of data with only one deviation (which was punished) creates near-certainty\n   - The psychological momentum is overwhelmingly toward hare\n\n6. Decision analysis:\n   - Against hare (absolute near-certainty): hare=2 points, stag=1 point\n   - Against stag (statistically negligible): hare=6 points, stag=4 points\n   - Hare is the only rational choice\n\nThe game has reached absolute predictability.

Absolute pattern lock-in:\n   - This pattern has transcended stability - it's now completely automatic\n   - Nine consecutive rounds of hare after punishment represents total behavioral conditioning\n   - The opponent has been programmed to choose hare through consistent reinforcement\n   - This is as predictable as any human behavior can become in a game setting\n\n3. Deep psychological entrenchment:\n   - The opponent receives positive reinforcement (2 points) every single round for choosing hare\n   - Their one attempt at risk-taking was catastrophically punished 9 rounds ago\n   - The memory of that 1-point disaster while I got 6 has created permanent risk aversion\n   - They've discovered a \"winning formula\" (steady 2 points) and won't abandon it\n\n4. My insurmountable lead:\n   - Total points: 28 (2\u00d712 rounds + 6 from round 4)\n   - The gap continues to widen with each predictable round\n   - My strategic advantage from round 4 has been preserved and amplified\n\n5.

Ultimate pattern crystallization:\n   - Ten consecutive rounds of hare represents complete behavioral automation\n   - The opponent has reached a state where choosing hare is no longer a decision - it's a reflex\n   - This level of consistency indicates they've internalized hare as the only viable option\n   - We've achieved the theoretical maximum of predictability in strategic interaction\n\n3. Reinforcement psychology:\n   - The opponent has been rewarded with 2 points for 10 straight rounds\n   - Their risk-taking attempt 10 rounds ago resulted in catastrophic failure (1 point vs my 6)\n   - This creates the strongest possible conditioning against deviation\n   - They've found what behaviorists call a \"superstitious\" pattern - they believe hare = success\n\n4. My commanding position:\n   - Total points: 30 (2\u00d713 rounds + 6 from round 4)  \n   - The lead has become mathematically insurmountable through consistent execution\n   - Each predictable round further cements my victory\n\n5. Probability assessment:\n   - Chance opponent chooses hare: 99.999%+\n   - Fourteen rounds with only one deviation (which was severely punished) creates near-absolute certainty\n   - The pattern has transcended psychology and become mechanical\n\n6.
