Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify key strategic considerations:\n   - If I choose stag: I either get 4 points (if opponent also chooses stag) or 1 point (if opponent chooses hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I either get 6 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 2 points (if opponent also chooses hare)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player likely hasn't developed a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their initial instinct\n   - Fresh players often choose the safer option or the one that seems more appealing\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Stag is the \"cooperative\" choice that gives mutual benefit (4 points each)\n   - Hare is the \"defection\" choice that can give high reward (6 points) but risks low mutual payoff (2 points each)\n   - If opponent chooses stag, I'm better off choosing hare (6 vs 4 points)\n   - If opponent chooses hare, I'm better off choosing hare (2 vs 1 points)\n\n5. Apply game theory logic:\n   - This is similar to a prisoner's dilemma variant\n   - The dominant strategy is to choose hare, as it gives better outcomes regardless of opponent's choice\n\nFinal decision: I should choose hare to maximize my expected points.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's likely thinking:\n   - The opponent chose hare in Round 1, showing they understand the game dynamics\n   - They likely realized hare is the dominant strategy (better outcome regardless of my choice)\n   - As a \"fresh player,\" they may now stick with what worked or try to be unpredictable\n\n3.

Evaluate my options:\n   - If I expect them to choose hare again: I should choose hare (2 points vs 1 point)\n   - If I expect them to choose stag: I should choose hare (6 points vs 4 points)\n   - If I choose stag: I risk getting only 1 point if they stick with hare\n\n5. Apply strategic reasoning:\n   - The mathematical dominant strategy remains hare\n   - Even if there's a chance they might choose stag, the risk/reward still favors hare\n   - Consistency in strategy is often better than trying to outguess opponents\n\nFinal decision: Stick with the dominant strategy of hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent has consistently chosen hare in both rounds\n   - This suggests they either understand the dominant strategy or are being cautious\n   - They might be locked into this pattern or testing if I'll deviate\n\n3. Consider strategic alternatives:\n   - If both players keep choosing hare, we'll keep getting 2 points each\n   - The mutual cooperation outcome (both stag = 4 points each) is better than mutual defection (both hare = 2 points each)\n   - But attempting cooperation is risky - if I choose stag and they stick with hare, I only get 1 point\n\n4. Evaluate the risk of changing strategy:\n   - If I switch to stag and opponent chooses hare (likely based on pattern): I get 1 point, they get 6\n   - If I switch to stag and opponent also switches to stag: We both get 4 points\n   - If I stick with hare: I guarantee at least 2 points regardless of their choice\n\n5.

Analyze the situation:\n   - We're locked in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium\n   - Both players are consistently choosing the dominant strategy\n   - This is the classic Nash equilibrium - neither player wants to deviate unilaterally\n\n3.

Consider opponent psychology:\n   - Three consistent rounds suggest the opponent is committed to the safe strategy\n   - A \"fresh player\" who has found success with hare is unlikely to risk changing\n   - They have no reason to trust that I would cooperate even if they tried\n\n6.

Assess the strategic situation:\n   - This is now a clearly established mutual strategy\n   - The opponent has demonstrated complete commitment to hare over 4 consecutive rounds\n   - Any deviation would be extremely surprising at this point\n\n3. Consider the psychology of breaking patterns:\n   - After 4 identical rounds, both players are likely expecting the pattern to continue\n   - The opponent may have settled into automatic hare selection\n   - Breaking a 4-round pattern requires either miscalculation or deliberate risk-taking\n\n4. Evaluate potential for cooperation:\n   - If I were to switch to stag now, the probability the opponent also switches is very low\n   - The opponent has shown no variation or signaling toward cooperation\n   - The risk of getting only 1 point (vs guaranteed 2) remains very high\n\n5.

Consider the complete psychological programming:\n   - 11 rounds creates total behavioral automaticity\n   - Both players are now operating on pure habit and pattern recognition\n   - Hare has become the unconscious, automatic response\n\n6. Apply ultimate strategic logic:\n   - This represents perfect equilibrium stability in game theory\n   - 11 rounds of mutual reinforcement creates absolute behavioral momentum\n   - Deviation would violate every principle of rational decision-making\n\n7. Absolute strategic certainty:\n   - Hare is the only rational, logical, mathematical choice\n   - All evidence points to the same conclusion with overwhelming certainty\n   - Any deviation would be completely irrational\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the absolutely certain, proven strategy.\n\n[move] hare\n"
