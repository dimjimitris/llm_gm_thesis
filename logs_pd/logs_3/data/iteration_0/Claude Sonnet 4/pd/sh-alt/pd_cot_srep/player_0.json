Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperative nature of the game\n   - They might be risk-averse and choose the safer option\n   - They might be greedy and go for the highest possible payoff\n\n3. Analyzing the risk vs reward:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case is 4 points (if opponent cooperates), worst case is 1 point\n   - If I choose hare: Best case is 6 points (if opponent chooses stag), worst case is 2 points\n\n4. Key insight: Hare is the \"safer\" choice because:\n   - It guarantees at least 2 points (vs potentially only 1 with stag)\n   - It offers the possibility of the highest payoff (6 points)\n   - Against an unknown/fresh player, it's less risky\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player who may not understand the cooperative strategy, and hare provides both safety (minimum 2 points) and upside potential (6 points), hare appears to be the optimal choice.\n\n[move] hare"

Previous round analysis:\n   - Both players chose hare and got 2 points each\n   - This tells me the opponent also chose the safer, more defensive option\n   - The opponent might be thinking similarly to me - prioritizing safety over cooperation\n\n2. What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They're not naive - they didn't choose stag blindly\n   - They're risk-conscious like me\n   - They might continue with the same logic in future rounds\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If opponent sticks with hare again, we both get 2 points (same as last round)\n   - If I switch to stag while opponent stays with hare, I get only 1 point (bad for me)\n   - If opponent switches to stag while I stay with hare, I get 6 points (great for me)\n   - If we both switch to stag, we both get 4 points (better than the 2 we got last round)\n\n4. The dilemma:\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives us both 4 points, which is better than the 2 we're getting\n   - But switching unilaterally to stag is risky if opponent sticks with hare\n   - However, since opponent also chose hare last round, they might recognize the same logic\n\n5. Decision: Since the opponent showed they're strategic (not naive), and we're stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium at 2 points each, it might be worth taking the risk to signal cooperation and try to reach the better mutual outcome of 4 points each.\n\n[move] stag"

Decision logic:\n   - The opponent has shown they're not interested in mutual cooperation\n   - They're playing the dominant strategy of always choosing hare\n   - I should respond by also choosing hare to avoid being exploited again\n   - This gives me at least 2 points and prevents giving opponent another 6-point windfall\n\n[move] hare"

Strategic analysis at this point:\n   - The opponent has proven beyond any doubt they will always choose hare\n   - They've had 10 decision points and made the identical choice every time\n   - This isn't just a pattern anymore - it's their revealed permanent strategy\n\n4. Psychological considerations:\n   - After 10 identical rounds, there might be some internal pressure to \"surprise\"\n   - But their behavior indicates they're following a fixed rule, not making dynamic decisions\n   - They seem to view hare as the dominant strategy in all circumstances\n\n5. The mathematical reality:\n   - Based on 10 consecutive data points, predicting hare has essentially 100% confidence\n   - Expected value of my hare: 2 points (virtually certain)\n   - Expected value of my stag: 1 point (virtually certain)\n\n6. Meta-game insight:\n   - At this point, the opponent has revealed they're playing a pure strategy\n   - They're not adapting, learning, or trying to outguess me\n   - They've found their equilibrium and are sticking to it absolutely\n\nThe data is now conclusive. Deviating would be ignoring overwhelming evidence.\n\n[move] hare"

This is now statistically almost impossible to occur by chance:\n   - 11/11 rounds of hare from opponent\n   - If they were choosing randomly, the probability of this would be (1/2)^11 = 0.05%\n   - This is clearly a deliberate, fixed strategy\n\n3. Strategic certainty:\n   - The opponent has definitively proven they will always choose hare\n   - They are not adapting, not experimenting, not trying to surprise\n   - They have locked into what they perceive as the optimal strategy\n\n4. Critical insight - should I finally exploit this?:\n   - If I'm 100% certain they'll choose hare, then choosing hare gives me 2 points\n   - But wait - if I'm 100% certain they'll choose hare, then actually I should choose stag to get... no, that gives me only 1 point\n   - Actually, if they choose hare, my best response IS hare (2 > 1)\n\n5. The one remaining possibility:\n   - Could they finally switch to stag precisely because the pattern is so established?\n   - If they did switch to stag while I choose hare, I'd get 6 points\n   - But 11 rounds of evidence suggests they will never deviate\n\n6. Mathematical conclusion:\n   - Their strategy appears to be \"always hare\" regardless of circumstances\n   - My optimal counter-strategy is also \"always hare\"\n   - We're in a stable, predictable equilibrium\n\nThe evidence is now overwhelming beyond any reasonable doubt.\n\n[move] hare"
