Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - They might choose the cooperative option (stag) or the safer option (hare)\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Choosing hare gives me a chance at the highest reward (6 points) if they choose stag\n   - Choosing hare also guarantees at least 2 points even if they also choose hare\n   - Choosing stag risks getting only 1 point if they choose hare\n   - However, mutual cooperation (both stag) gives a decent 4 points\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player who might be unpredictable, I should choose the move that gives me the best expected outcome while protecting against the worst case.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare because it gives me a chance at the maximum reward (6 points) and protects me with a reasonable minimum (2 points).\n\n[move] hare\n"

Evaluate the probabilities and outcomes:\n   - If the opponent is likely to stick with hare (since it worked safely last round), then choosing stag would give me only 1 point\n   - If the opponent might switch to stag (thinking I'll stick with hare), then choosing hare would give me 6 points\n   - The mutual cooperation option (both stag) gives 4 points, which is better than the 2 we both got last round\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent showed they're willing to play hare, so they might do it again\n   - But they might also think I'll switch to stag for the cooperative outcome\n   - Choosing hare again maintains my upside potential while protecting my downside\n\nFinal decision: I'll stick with hare because the opponent demonstrated they're willing to play it, and this gives me the best expected value.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Consider the strategic implications:\n   - If we both keep choosing hare, we'll keep getting 2 points each\n   - There's potential for much better outcomes if we could coordinate on stag (4 points each)\n   - But there's also risk - if I switch to stag and they stick with hare, I get only 1 point while they get 6\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Stick with hare: Likely outcome is 2 points again (safe but suboptimal)\n   - Switch to stag: Either 4 points (if they also switch) or 1 point (if they stick with hare)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown consistency with hare\n   - They might be expecting me to switch to try to break the pattern\n   - But they might also switch themselves, thinking the same thing\n   - Given their consistent behavior, the safer assumption is they'll play hare again\n   - However, mutual cooperation (stag) would benefit us both more than the current 2-2 outcome\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - If I'm wrong about them switching to stag, I lose 1 point compared to playing hare\n   - If I'm right about them switching to stag, I gain 2 points compared to playing hare\n   - The potential upside of cooperation outweighs the risk given the pattern\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to stag to try to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome, betting that my opponent might also recognize that 4-4 is better than 2-2.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Evaluate any alternative reasoning:\n   - Could there be a surprise coming? After 10 identical moves, this is statistically irrelevant\n   - Should I try something different? Only if I want to score fewer points\n   - Is there hidden complexity I'm missing? No - the payoff matrix is simple and clear\n   - Am I being too rigid? No - I'm being mathematically optimal\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - I've identified the pattern, adapted to it, and am maximizing my outcomes\n   - The 5-point deficit is historical and not growing under current play\n   - Each round I continue with hare, I maintain optimal scoring\n   - There is literally no better strategy available\n\n6. Final reasoning:\n   - This scenario has become completely deterministic\n   - My opponent will play hare\n   - I should play hare\n   - This maximizes my points\n\nFinal decision: I'll play hare, continuing the mathematically optimal response to an opponent who has demonstrated perfect, unwavering commitment to hare across ten consecutive rounds.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
