You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

If they're thinking strategically, they might want to signal cooperation. However, if I choose stag and they stick with hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\nGiven that we both showed caution in round 1, there's a reasonable chance they might be open to cooperation now that we've \"tested the waters.\"\n\n[move] (Since we both played cautiously last round, they might be willing to try for mutual cooperation this time, and the 4-4 outcome is much better than repeating 2-2) stag\n"

If they surprise me and switch to stag while I choose hare, I'll get 6 points.\n\nThe evidence suggests they're likely to stick with their hare strategy.\n\n[move] (My opponent has chosen hare twice in a row, suggesting they prefer the safe strategy or are trying to exploit cooperation attempts, so I'll match their approach) hare\n"

This suggests they're either:\n1. Playing a consistently defensive strategy\n2. Trying to exploit any cooperative moves I make\n3.

If I play stag, I'm very likely to get 1 point again. If I play hare, I guarantee 2 points and avoid being exploited.\n\nThe rational choice against a predictable hare player is to also play hare.\n\n[move] (My opponent has consistently chosen hare in all three rounds, showing a clear pattern of defensive play, so I'll continue with hare to secure 2 points rather than risk getting only 1) hare\n"
