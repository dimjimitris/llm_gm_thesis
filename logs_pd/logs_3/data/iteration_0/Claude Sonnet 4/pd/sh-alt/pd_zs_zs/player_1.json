We're in a classic situation where mutual distrust prevents us from achieving the optimal outcome (4 points each from mutual stag), so we settle for the safer suboptimal outcome (2 points each from mutual hare).\n\nGiven this well-established pattern and the opponent's consistent refusal to genuinely cooperate, I should stick with the hare strategy that has proven stable and prevents exploitation.\n\n[move] (Maintaining the proven stable strategy) hare\n"

Similarly, I've learned to punish their stag attempts.\n\nWe're in a stable but suboptimal Nash equilibrium. Neither of us has any incentive to deviate because deviation gets punished. The mutual hare strategy, while not optimal, is the rational response given the opponent's demonstrated behavior.\n\nThere's no reason to expect this will change - we've had many opportunities to establish cooperation and it has never worked.

Neither player can be trusted to reciprocate cooperation\n\nThis is a textbook example of how lack of trust prevents optimal outcomes. While we could both get 4 points each with mutual stag, the repeated betrayals early in the game established a pattern of mutual distrust that has locked us into this suboptimal but stable 2-points-each outcome.\n\nGiven the extensive history and the opponent's consistent behavior, there's no rational reason to expect a change.
