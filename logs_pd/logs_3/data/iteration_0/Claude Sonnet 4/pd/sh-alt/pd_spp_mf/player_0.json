    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

This gives us valuable information about the opponent's decision-making:\n1. They also played conservatively in the first round\n2. They might be risk-averse like us\n3. Or they could be following a similar strategic analysis\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Now we have data! The fact that they chose hare suggests:\n1. They're thinking strategically (not randomly)\n2. They might be open to cooperation if trust can be established\n3. We're both in the \"safe but suboptimal\" equilibrium at 2 points each\n\nKey strategic considerations for round 2:\n- If they stick with hare, we get 2 points again (status quo)\n- If we switch to stag and they stick with hare, we get only 1 point (bad)\n- If we both switch to stag, we both get 4 points (optimal mutual outcome)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a classic trust-building scenario. Should we try to signal cooperation by switching to stag, or continue with the safe hare strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is where game theory gets interesting with repeated play. There's potential for implicit coordination. Since we both demonstrated strategic thinking in round 1, there might be mutual recognition that stag-stag would be better for both of us.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** I'm leaning toward stag this time because:\n1. We've established that both players think strategically\n2. The mutual payoff of 4-4 is clearly superior to 2-2\n3. Risk: if they stick with hare, we only get 1 point\n4. But this could be the round to test if coordination is possible\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The reasoning is sound. Since we both showed strategic thinking, there's a chance they're thinking the same way - that we should try to coordinate on the better mutual outcome.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Switch to Stag to test if we can achieve the mutually beneficial coordination, based on the evidence that both players think strategically.\n\n[move] (Both players showed strategic thinking in round 1 - testing if we can coordinate on the mutually beneficial outcome of 4 points each) stag\n"

The opponent chose hare again while we switched to stag, giving us only 1 point while they got 6. This tells us important information:\n1. They're sticking with the safe hare strategy\n2. They might not be thinking about mutual coordination\n3. They could be exploiting our potential cooperative moves\n4. Or they're being consistently risk-averse\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Let's analyze the pattern:\n- Round 1: Both hare (2 points each)  \n- Round 2: We stag, they hare (we got 1, they got 6)\n\nTheir behavior suggests they found a strategy they're comfortable with - hare gives them either 2 or 6 points, never the worst outcome of 1. They might continue this pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we have a choice - do we go back to hare to avoid getting exploited again, or do we try stag one more time to see if they learned from getting 6 points and might switch?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** From a pure game theory perspective, if we believe they'll stick with hare, then our best response is also hare (getting 2 points vs 1 point). The opponent seems to have found their equilibrium strategy.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** I strongly recommend going back to hare because:\n1. The opponent has shown consistent hare behavior (2 out of 2 rounds)\n2. If they continue with hare, we get 2 points instead of 1\n3. If they surprise us and switch to stag, we get 6 points (excellent for us)\n4.

The opponent has established a pattern of playing hare, and we got punished for trying to cooperate. We should match their strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Return to hare to match the opponent's consistent strategy and avoid being exploited again.\n\n[move] (Opponent has shown consistent hare strategy - matching their approach to secure 2 points rather than risk getting 1 again) hare\n"

We should lock into the hare vs hare equilibrium\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** It seems like we've learned this opponent's strategy.

We're in a stable equilibrium against this opponent type\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Is there any theoretical or practical reason to even consider stag at this point?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Absolutely none. In game theory, we make decisions based on available information and rational analysis. Seven rounds of identical behavior constitutes overwhelming evidence. Choosing stag would be irrational given the data.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** The opponent has essentially turned this into a single-player optimization problem. They've removed all uncertainty from our decision-making process. Hare is the only logical choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The analysis is unambiguous. We should continue with our proven successful strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue with hare - seven rounds of perfect consistency from the opponent makes this the only rational choice.\n\n[move] (Seven consecutive rounds of opponent hare strategy - maintaining optimal response for guaranteed 2 points) hare\n"
