Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the established pattern post-cooperation attempt:\n   - Rounds 1-6: Both chose hare consistently\n   - Round 7: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (they got burned with 1 point)\n   - Rounds 8-10: Both chose hare consistently again\n   - The opponent has firmly returned to hare after their failed cooperation\n\n2. Evaluate the opponent's reinforced behavior:\n   - They attempted cooperation once and were severely punished\n   - They've now chosen hare for 3 straight rounds since that failure\n   - This shows they've learned that deviation is risky\n   - Their behavior is becoming predictable again\n\n3. Consider the psychological reinforcement:\n   - The exploitation in round 7 likely made them more risk-averse\n   - Three consecutive rounds of \"safe\" hare choices reinforces this pattern\n   - They're probably now viewing hare as the only sensible strategy\n   - The memory of getting only 1 point while I got 6 is still fresh\n\n4. Assess current strategic landscape:\n   - The opponent appears to have abandoned any cooperation attempts\n   - They're back to the dominant strategy mindset\n   - Very high probability they continue with hare\n   - No indication they're willing to risk cooperation again soon\n\n5. Strategic conclusion:\n   - The opponent's return to consistent hare play after punishment suggests they're locked in\n   - They've had their \"lesson learned\" moment about the risks of cooperation\n   - Continuing with hare gives me the best expected outcome\n   - Either 2 points (if they stick with hare) or 6 points (if they surprisingly deviate)\n\n[move] (Opponent has chosen hare for three straight rounds after being punished, pattern is re-established) hare\n"

Evaluate the strength of their commitment to hare:\n   - After one failed cooperation attempt, they've now stuck with hare for 4 consecutive rounds\n   - This is even more consistent than their initial 6-round streak\n   - The punishment they received in round 7 appears to have permanently reinforced hare as their strategy\n   - They show no signs of deviating again\n\n3. Consider the psychological lock-in:\n   - The severe punishment (1 point vs my 6) created a strong negative association with cooperation\n   - Four rounds of \"safe\" returns to hare have reinforced this learning\n   - They likely view any deviation from hare as too risky now\n   - The pattern is stronger than ever\n\n4. Assess strategic probabilities:\n   - Extremely high probability they choose hare again\n   - Their behavior has become highly predictable after the punishment\n   - They appear to have learned that hare is the only \"safe\" choice\n   - No indication whatsoever of willingness to risk cooperation again\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent is now more committed to hare than they were initially\n   - Their failed cooperation attempt actually strengthened their adherence to the dominant strategy\n   - Continuing with hare remains the optimal choice\n   - Guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 6 if they somehow deviate\n\n[move] (Opponent more locked into hare than ever after punishment, four straight rounds confirms this) hare\n"
