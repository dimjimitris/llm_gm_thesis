The key insight is that stag is the better cooperative outcome (4 points each), but it's risky because if the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might be inclined to play it safe with hare, or they might not fully grasp the cooperative potential of both choosing stag.\n\nGiven the uncertainty about their move and the significant penalty for being the only one to choose stag (1 point vs 6 for them), I'll choose the safer option that guarantees at least 2 points and gives me a chance at 6 if they choose stag.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Now that we've both shown we're cautious players, there might be an opportunity to signal cooperation.\n\nThe dilemma is: if I switch to stag hoping they'll do the same (giving us both 4 points), but they stick with hare, I'll only get 1 point while they get 6. But if we both switch to stag, we both do much better than the 2 points we just earned.\n\nGiven that we both played conservatively in round 1, I think there's a reasonable chance they might also be considering the cooperative move now.

Try stag again (which they can exploit for another 6 points)\n2.

This cooperative equilibrium has become incredibly stable and reliable.\n\nThe pattern shows:\n- Rounds 1-6: Early mutual hare phase (2 points each)\n- Round 7: Transition round with opponent's cooperative signal\n- Rounds 8-15: Eight straight rounds of successful mutual stag cooperation (4 points each)\n\nThis sustained cooperation over eight rounds demonstrates we've reached a very stable Nash equilibrium. Both players have consistently chosen the mutually beneficial strategy, showing complete trust and understanding of the game dynamics.\n\nThe mathematical advantage is clear - we're earning 4 points per round instead of the 2 points we were getting with mutual hare. This cooperation has been maintained so consistently that it's become the expected norm.\n\nGiven this extremely stable and mutually beneficial pattern, I'll continue with our established cooperative strategy.\n\n[move] stag\n"
