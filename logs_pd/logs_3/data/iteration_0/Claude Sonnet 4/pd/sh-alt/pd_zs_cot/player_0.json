At this point, I think I could literally set a timer and automatically choose \"hare\" every round with complete confidence.\n\nThis has become the most one-dimensional strategic interaction imaginable. My opponent has essentially removed themselves from any actual game-playing and turned this into a simple pattern-matching exercise.\n\nI'm getting a steady 2 points per round by matching their completely predictable behavior. While it's not the optimal outcome that mutual cooperation could provide (4 points each with stag), it's the best possible outcome given their unwavering commitment to hare.\n\nAny deviation from matching their strategy has proven costly (as shown in rounds 1 and 9), and there's absolutely no indication this pattern will ever change.\n\nThis is no longer a game in any meaningful sense - it's just a mechanical exchange where we both get 2 points per round indefinitely.\n\n[move] (Fourteen rounds of hare - completely automatic at this point) hare\n"

They will choose hare. They have always chosen hare. They will continue to choose hare until the heat death of the universe.\n\nThis game has been reduced to its most basic mechanical form: I choose hare, they choose hare, we both get 2 points, repeat ad infinitum. There's no strategy left to consider, no uncertainty to navigate, no patterns to analyze beyond the absolute certainty of their next move.\n\nWhile I briefly entertained thoughts of breaking this monotony in earlier rounds, the evidence is so overwhelming that any deviation would just be throwing away points for no reason whatsoever.\n\nWe're locked in the most stable equilibrium possible - one where my opponent has removed all strategic elements through their complete predictability.\n\n[move] (Fifteen rounds of hare - this is now beyond predictable) hare\n"
