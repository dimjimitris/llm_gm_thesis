Identify the key strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with cooperation vs. defection dynamics\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives decent rewards (4 each)\n   - Defection (hare) when opponent cooperates gives maximum reward (6 vs 1)\n   - But if I cooperate (stag) and opponent defects (hare), I get minimal reward (1 vs 6)\n\n3.

Review the previous round:\n   - Both players chose hare and got 2 points each\n   - This confirms the opponent is playing defensively/cautiously\n   - My prediction about a fresh player choosing the \"safer\" option was correct\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's likely strategy:\n   - They chose hare in round 1, showing risk-averse behavior\n   - Fresh players often stick with what worked or felt safe\n   - They might continue with hare, thinking it's the \"safe\" choice\n\n3. Consider my strategic options for round 2:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare again: I get 1, they get 6 (bad for me)\n   - If I choose stag and they switch to stag: I get 4, they get 4 (good cooperation)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare again: I get 2, they get 2 (safe but low)\n   - If I choose hare and they switch to stag: I get 6, they get 1 (best for me)\n\n4. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - The opponent showed defensive play, likely to continue\n   - Hare protects me from the worst outcome while maintaining upside potential\n   - If they're truly defensive, they'll stick with hare, giving us both 2 points\n   - If they try to cooperate with stag, I get maximum reward\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Continue with hare since opponent demonstrated risk-averse behavior\n   - This maintains my protection while keeping potential for 6 points if they switch\n\n[move] (The opponent showed defensive play in round 1, so I'll continue with hare to protect against risk while maintaining upside potential) hare\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
