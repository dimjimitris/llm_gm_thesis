    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the key strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with cooperation vs. defection dynamics\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives decent rewards (4 each)\n   - Defection (hare) when opponent cooperates gives maximum reward (6 vs 1)\n   - But if I cooperate (stag) and opponent defects (hare), I get minimal reward (1 vs 6)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not fully understand the strategic implications\n   - They might choose randomly or go for the \"safer\" option\n   - Hare seems \"safer\" since it guarantees at least 2 points and has potential for 6\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I either get 4 (if they choose stag) or 1 (if they choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I either get 6 (if they choose stag) or 2 (if they choose hare)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Against an inexperienced player, they're more likely to play defensively (hare)\n   - Choosing hare gives me better protection against their likely defensive play\n   - Even if they choose stag, I get the maximum payoff of 6\n\n[move] I choose hare. Against a fresh player, I expect them to play defensively, and hare gives me better expected value while protecting against the worst-case scenario.\n"

Review the previous round:\n   - Both players chose hare and got 2 points each\n   - This confirms the opponent is playing defensively/cautiously\n   - My prediction about a fresh player choosing the \"safer\" option was correct\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's likely strategy:\n   - They chose hare in round 1, showing risk-averse behavior\n   - Fresh players often stick with what worked or felt safe\n   - They might continue with hare, thinking it's the \"safe\" choice\n\n3. Consider my strategic options for round 2:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare again: I get 1, they get 6 (bad for me)\n   - If I choose stag and they switch to stag: I get 4, they get 4 (good cooperation)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare again: I get 2, they get 2 (safe but low)\n   - If I choose hare and they switch to stag: I get 6, they get 1 (best for me)\n\n4. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - The opponent showed defensive play, likely to continue\n   - Hare protects me from the worst outcome while maintaining upside potential\n   - If they're truly defensive, they'll stick with hare, giving us both 2 points\n   - If they try to cooperate with stag, I get maximum reward\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Continue with hare since opponent demonstrated risk-averse behavior\n   - This maintains my protection while keeping potential for 6 points if they switch\n\n[move] (The opponent showed defensive play in round 1, so I'll continue with hare to protect against risk while maintaining upside potential) hare\n"
