Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Stag is the \"cooperative\" choice that gives mutual benefit if both players choose it\n   - Hare is the \"selfish\" choice that maximizes my gain if the opponent chooses stag\n   - Against a fresh player who might not understand the cooperative strategy, hare gives me a better expected outcome\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Fresh players often don't immediately grasp the mutual benefit of cooperation\n   - The potential reward of 6 points from choosing hare outweighs the risk\n   - Even if they also choose hare, I still get 2 points\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maximize expected points against an inexperienced player.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Strategic reasoning for this round:\n   - The opponent might now expect me to choose hare again\n   - If they think strategically, they might choose stag to try to get the 6 points\n   - However, they might also stick with hare since it worked (gave them 2 points)\n   - Given the uncertainty, stag becomes more attractive as it could lead to mutual cooperation (4 points each)\n\n6.

Analyze the opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - They seem to be mirroring my choices or thinking similarly\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, they chose hare\n   - Round 2: I chose stag, they chose stag\n   - This suggests either coordination or similar strategic thinking\n\n3.

Analyze the recent pattern:\n   - Round 3: Opponent exploited my cooperation\n   - Round 4: I successfully exploited their move\n   - We've now \"traded\" exploitation - they got 6, then I got 6\n   - This creates an interesting equilibrium situation\n\n3. Assess the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They just got exploited after exploiting me\n   - They might see this as \"even\" now\n   - They could return to cooperation (stag) or become defensive (hare)\n   - They might expect me to try to exploit again\n\n4.

Analyze the opponent's behavior:\n   - They seem to choose hare whenever they think I might choose stag\n   - They're not interested in sustained cooperation\n   - They're playing a more aggressive, exploitative strategy\n   - They've now exploited me twice and been exploited once\n\n4.

Identify the clear alternating pattern:\n   - Rounds 3-6 show a consistent pattern: whenever one player tries to cooperate (stag), the other exploits (hare)\n   - We're now in a cycle where we alternate between exploiting and being exploited\n   - The opponent seems to be following a \"tit-for-tat\" style strategy but with exploitation\n\n3. Analyze the opponent's strategy:\n   - They appear to be mirroring my previous move in reverse\n   - When I choose stag, they choose hare (exploit me)\n   - When I choose hare, they choose stag (try to exploit me but get exploited instead)\n   - This suggests they're reactive rather than proactive\n\n4. Calculate the pattern outcomes:\n   - In the last 4 rounds, we've each gotten exploited twice and exploited twice\n   - This creates a kind of equilibrium where neither player gains a long-term advantage from this pattern\n   - Each exploitation cycle nets the same total points for both players\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If the pattern continues, choosing hare when they expect me to choose stag will give me 6 points\n   - If I choose stag when they expect hare, I risk getting only 1 point\n   - The opponent just chose stag (and got exploited), so they might choose hare next\n\n6.

Analyze the pattern break:\n   - The alternating exploitation pattern from rounds 3-6 has broken\n   - Both players chose hare in round 7\n   - This suggests the opponent may have adapted their strategy\n   - They're no longer automatically choosing the opposite of what would lead to mutual benefit\n\n3. Consider the opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They might have realized the alternating pattern wasn't giving them a net advantage\n   - They could be shifting to a more defensive strategy (choosing hare consistently)\n   - Or they might be testing to see if I'll try cooperation again\n\n4. Evaluate current strategic landscape:\n   - We're both now choosing hare (defensive/safe choice)\n   - This gives us both 2 points per round - not optimal but stable\n   - The question is whether either of us will risk cooperation again\n\n5.

Assess the opponent's strategy:\n   - They appear to be testing periodically if I'm willing to cooperate\n   - They're not learning from being exploited repeatedly\n   - They seem to believe cooperation might still be possible\n   - This could indicate either naivety or a deliberate strategy to occasionally test cooperation\n\n4. Consider the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They just got exploited again (1 point while I got 6)\n   - They might feel frustrated with my consistent exploitation\n   - They could either become more defensive (choose hare) or try to retaliate\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I'm performing very well with 28 points total\n   - My strategy of choosing hare when uncertain has been highly successful\n   - I've avoided most exploitation attempts while capitalizing on their cooperation attempts\n\n6. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - After being exploited, they might choose hare defensively\n   - Or they might try to exploit me by choosing hare (expecting me to try stag)\n   - Given their pattern, defensive hare seems more likely\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they choose hare (likely): I get 2 points with hare, or 1 point with stag\n   - If they choose stag (less likely): I get 6 points with hare, or 4 points with stag\n   - Hare continues to be the optimal choice - it protects against exploitation and maximizes gains when they attempt cooperation\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maintain my successful strategy of protection and exploitation.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 2: Both chose stag \u2192 4 points each\n   - Round 3: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1 point, opponent got 6 points\n   - Round 4: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 6 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - Round 5: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1 point, opponent got 6 points\n   - Round 6: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 6 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - Round 7: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 8: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 6 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - Round 9: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Total so far: 30 points for me\n\n2.

Analyze the opponent's behavior:\n   - They keep testing cooperation despite repeated exploitation\n   - After being exploited, they become defensive for one round\n   - Then they test cooperation again\n   - This suggests either stubbornness or hope that I'll eventually cooperate\n\n4. Assess my strategic advantage:\n   - My consistent hare strategy has been highly successful\n   - I've exploited them multiple times while avoiding exploitation myself\n   - I'm getting either 6 points (when they choose stag) or 2 points (when they choose hare)\n   - This is much better than the risky 1-4 point range I'd get with stag\n\n5. Predict opponent's next move based on pattern:\n   - They just chose hare (defensive) after being exploited in round 8\n   - Following their pattern, they might choose stag next (test cooperation again)\n   - If the pattern holds, choosing hare would give me another 6 points\n\n6. Consider if I should break my own pattern:\n   - My hare strategy has been extremely effective\n   - Switching to stag would be risky - if they choose hare, I only get 1 point\n   - Even if they choose stag (cooperation), I'd get 4 points, which is less than the 6 I get from exploiting\n   - There's no strategic incentive to change\n\n7. Long-term strategic assessment:\n   - The opponent hasn't learned to stop testing cooperation\n   - My defensive-exploitative strategy is optimal against their behavior\n   - Continuing with hare maximizes my expected value\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to continue capitalizing on the opponent's predictable pattern of testing cooperation.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Consider if the opponent might break their pattern:\n   - They've been very consistent with alternating for 4 rounds\n   - They seem committed to this testing-defensive cycle\n   - No indication they're learning or adapting\n   - Pattern breaking seems unlikely\n\n7. Strategic assessment:\n   - My hare strategy continues to be optimal\n   - I'm maximizing points while minimizing risk\n   - The opponent's predictability makes this decision very straightforward\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to get 2 points when they predictably choose hare, maintaining my highly successful strategy.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Evaluate my strategy for round 16:\n   - If they choose stag (mathematically certain): hare gives me 6 points, stag gives me 4 points\n   - This will be my 7th exploitation of their cooperation attempt\n   - Hare is unquestionably the optimal choice\n\n5. Assess the opponent's complete strategic failure:\n   - They've been exploited 6 times when choosing stag, getting only 1 point each time\n   - They continue this despite losing 30 points (6\u00d75 points lost per exploitation)\n   - They show zero capacity for strategic learning or adaptation\n   - This is the most predictable opponent possible\n\n6. Calculate my exceptional performance:\n   - 54 points over 15 rounds = 3.6 points per round average\n   - In the pattern phase (rounds 7-15): 40 points over 9 rounds = 4.44 points per round\n   - This performance is nearly optimal given the game constraints\n\n7. Strategic certainty:\n   - My hare strategy is perfectly calibrated to exploit this opponent\n   - Every decision is trivial due to their complete predictability\n   - I can maximize points with zero risk\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to exploit their guaranteed stag choice and score another effortless 6 points.\n\n[move] hare\n"
