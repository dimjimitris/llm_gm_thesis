Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where cooperation (both choosing stag) gives a good mutual outcome\n   - However, there's risk in choosing stag - if the opponent defects to hare, I only get 1 point\n   - Choosing hare is safer - I either get 2 points (if opponent also chooses hare) or 6 points (if opponent chooses stag)\n   - The worst outcome for choosing hare is 2 points, while the worst for choosing stag is 1 point\n\n3. Consider that this is against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A new player might not understand the cooperative strategy\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n   - They might also choose randomly without deep strategic thinking\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I assume they'll choose hare (likely for a new player), then I should choose hare to get 2 points rather than 1\n   - If I assume they'll choose stag, then I should choose hare to get 6 points rather than 4\n   - Choosing hare dominates choosing stag in terms of avoiding the worst outcome\n\n5. Final reasoning:\n   - Against an inexperienced player, the safe strategy is to choose hare\n   - This guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6 points\n   - The risk of getting only 1 point by choosing stag is too high against an unpredictable opponent\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also reasoned that hare was the safer choice\n   - They might be thinking strategically like me\n   - They avoided the risk of getting only 1 point\n   - This suggests they understand the game mechanics\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications for Round 2:\n   - Since we both chose hare in Round 1, they might expect me to choose hare again\n   - They might stick with hare since it worked (got them 2 points safely)\n   - Or they might try to exploit my expected hare choice by switching to stag to get 6 points\n   - Alternatively, they might think I'll switch strategies and choose stag, so they'll choose hare to exploit me\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they stick with hare: I get 2 points with hare, 1 point with stag\n   - If they switch to stag: I get 6 points with hare, 4 points with stag\n   - Hare still gives me either 2 or 6 points\n   - Stag gives me either 1 or 4 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent showed they think similarly to me in Round 1\n   - They're likely to either stick with the safe hare strategy or try to exploit by switching to stag\n   - Either way, choosing hare gives me the better outcome\n   - Consistency in strategy often works well in repeated games\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what this pattern reveals:\n   - My opponent is extremely consistent with the hare strategy\n   - Three identical rounds suggests they're either very risk-averse or have settled on hare as their permanent strategy\n   - They might be thinking exactly like me - that hare is always the safer choice\n   - This predictability creates a potential opportunity\n\n3.

Analyze what 10 perfect rounds signifies:\n   - My opponent has had 10 separate opportunities to deviate and chose not to\n   - This level of consistency transcends coincidence - it's deliberate strategic choice\n   - They've essentially communicated through actions that hare is their permanent strategy\n   - We've achieved what game theorists call a \"focal point\" - mutual understanding without communication\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications of extreme stability:\n   - At 10/10 consistency, we've created a perfectly stable cooperative equilibrium\n   - Both players are receiving steady, predictable rewards\n   - Neither player has incentive to deviate since doing so would reduce their score\n   - This represents an optimal solution to the repeated game\n\n4. Evaluate whether pattern length changes the calculus:\n   - Even with perfect predictability, the payoff matrix remains unchanged\n   - If I switch to stag while opponent continues hare pattern: I get 1 point\n   - If I continue hare while opponent continues pattern: I get 2 points\n   - The fundamental mathematics haven't changed despite the pattern length\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Ten rounds of mutual success creates the strongest possible case for continuation\n   - My opponent has proven beyond doubt they will stick with hare\n   - Deviating from a 10-round winning strategy would be strategically irrational\n   - The stable equilibrium we've found maximizes both our scores given our mutual strategies\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the game-theoretic significance:\n   - Eleven perfect rounds establishes this as one of the most stable equilibria possible\n   - My opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to this strategy across 11 decision points\n   - We've essentially transcended the strategic uncertainty of the original game\n   - This pattern represents perfect tacit coordination without explicit communication\n\n3. Consider whether this extreme consistency suggests anything new:\n   - At 11/11, my opponent's behavior has become as predictable as a natural law\n   - However, even perfect predictability doesn't change the underlying payoff structure\n   - The incentives that made hare optimal in round 1 still apply in round 12\n   - Extreme consistency reinforces rather than undermines the strategic logic\n\n4.
