The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

If we both cooperate (choose stag), we both get the best mutual outcome (4 points each)\n2. If I choose hare while they choose stag, I get the maximum individual payoff (6 points)\n3. If they choose hare while I choose stag, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n4. Hare is the \"safer\" choice - it guarantees at least 2 points regardless of opponent's move\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might be inclined to play it safe with hare, or they might try to cooperate with stag. \n\nGiven the risk-reward structure, I'll choose the safer option that guarantees a decent minimum payoff while still having upside potential.\n\n[move] I choose hare. This gives me either 6 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 2 points (if opponent also chooses hare), avoiding the risk of only getting 1 point.\n"
