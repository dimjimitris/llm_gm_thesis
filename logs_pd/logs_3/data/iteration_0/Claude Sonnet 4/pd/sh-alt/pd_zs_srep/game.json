Looking at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Both choose stag: 4 points each\n- Both choose hare: 2 points each  \n- I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n- I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\nThis is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key insight is that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the best mutual outcome (4 points each), but it's risky because if the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might be inclined to play it safe with hare (guaranteed at least 2 points) or might not fully grasp the cooperative potential.\n\nHowever, the cooperative outcome (stag-stag) is significantly better than the safe outcome (hare-hare). I'll take the risk and signal cooperation, hoping the other player recognizes the mutual benefit.\n\n[move] I choose stag, aiming for the mutually beneficial outcome where we both get 4 points.\n"
