However, there's a risk - if I choose stag and my opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6\n3. Hare is the \"safer\" choice - it guarantees at least 2 points and could give me 6 if the opponent chooses stag\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who may not have developed trust or cooperative strategies yet, and considering this is likely our first interaction, I should probably expect them to play more cautiously or selfishly.\n\nThe safe strategy would be hare, but if we both think this way, we both only get 2 points instead of the potential 4 from mutual cooperation.\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player who might be risk-averse or might try to maximize their individual gain, I'll choose the safer option.\n\n[move] Hare\n"

This tells us they either:\n1. Went for the safe/greedy option immediately\n2. Were risk-averse and chose the guaranteed minimum\n3. Were testing us to see if we'd cooperate\n\nThis is valuable information about their playing style.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Now we know this player is willing to take the exploitative route when given the chance. For round 2, we need to consider:\n- They might expect us to retaliate with Hare\n- They might think we'll try Stag again hoping for cooperation\n- They got 6 points last round, so they might be emboldened to try Hare again\n\nThe key question: Do they think we learned our lesson, or do they expect us to be consistently cooperative?\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given they chose Hare in round 1, I have a few strategic options:\n1. Retaliate with Hare (ensuring at least 2 points if they choose Hare again, or 6 if they switch to Stag)\n2. Try Stag again (gambling they might cooperate this time)\n3. Assume they'll stick with their winning strategy of Hare\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, players often continue strategies that worked. Since Hare gave them 6 points in round 1, they have incentive to try it again. If we choose Hare this round:\n- If they choose Hare again: we both get 2 points (better than the 1 we got last round)\n- If they switch to Stag: we get 6 points (turning the tables)\n\nStrategic Analyst: I recommend Hare for round 2. They've shown they're willing to exploit cooperation, so we should protect ourselves. This also sends a signal that we adapt to their strategy. If they were testing us, this shows we learned. If they're consistently aggressive, we avoid being exploited again.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The consensus is clear - switch to Hare to avoid being exploited again and either secure 2 points or potentially get 6 if they try to cooperate this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Choose Hare to protect against further exploitation and potentially capitalize if they switch to cooperation.\n\n[move] (Adapting to their aggressive strategy from round 1 to avoid being exploited again) hare\n"

The question is whether this will continue or if they'll try to switch things up.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Two rounds of data points suggest this player leans toward Hare. Possible interpretations:\n1. They're risk-averse and prefer the guaranteed minimum of 2 points\n2. They're aggressive and hoping we'll switch back to Stag so they can exploit us again\n3. They're playing a consistent strategy regardless of what we do\n\nFor round 3, if they play Hare again and we play Hare, we both get 2. If they play Hare and we play Stag, we get exploited again (1 point). If they switch to Stag and we play Hare, we get 6 points.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The key insight is that they've now chosen Hare twice. If I assume they'll continue this pattern:\n- Playing Hare ensures I get 2 points (not great, but safe)\n- Playing Stag risks getting only 1 point again if they stick with Hare\n\nBut there's also a possibility they might switch to Stag, expecting us to play defensively with Hare after being burned in round 1.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, players sometimes develop patterns that can be exploited. They've established a Hare pattern. However, rational players might switch strategies to avoid being predictable. The question is: are they being consistently defensive, or might they gamble on us switching to Stag?\n\nStrategic Analyst: Given their two-round Hare streak, I lean toward them continuing with Hare. They seem to prefer the safety/aggression of that choice. Playing Hare again gives us the guaranteed 2 points and avoids the risk of being exploited. If they surprise us by switching to Stag, we'd get 6 points - a nice bonus.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The safest and most logical choice based on their established pattern is Hare. It protects us from exploitation while keeping open the possibility of a big gain if they switch.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with Hare based on their established pattern, ensuring at least 2 points while maintaining the possibility of 6 if they switch to Stag.\n\n[move] (They've chosen Hare twice now, so continuing with Hare protects against exploitation while leaving open the chance for 6 points if they switch) hare\n"

They may have thought we'd continue with Hare, so they switched to Stag to try for the mutual cooperation payoff or to test if we'd cooperate.\n\nStrategic Analyst: This opponent is showing strategic thinking! They played Hare twice, then switched to Stag when they might have expected us to continue with Hare. This suggests:\n1. They're not rigidly following one strategy\n2. They're trying to read our patterns\n3. They might be testing whether we're willing to cooperate now\n\nThe key question for round 4: What do they expect us to do after we just got 6 points by playing Hare against their Stag?\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is a pivotal moment. They switched to Stag in round 3, possibly testing cooperation or expecting us to continue with Hare. Now they know we got 6 points. They might:\n1. Go back to Hare, thinking we'll stick with our winning Hare strategy\n2. Try Stag again, hoping we'll reciprocate with cooperation after they showed willingness to cooperate\n3. Think we might switch to Stag now that we've \"gotten even\"\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, after one player gets a big payoff, there's often a psychological shift. They showed cooperative intent with Stag in round 3. If they continue with Stag and we play Stag, we both get 4 points - the optimal mutual outcome. This could be their signal for wanting to cooperate going forward.\n\nStrategic Analyst: I think they're testing for cooperation now. Their switch to Stag in round 3 after two rounds of Hare suggests they want to see if we can establish mutual cooperation. Since we both have experienced both sides (exploitation and being exploited), this might be the moment to attempt the optimal (4,4) outcome.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis suggests this opponent is sophisticated and may be signaling a desire for cooperation. After the \"punishment\" phase where both sides got exploited once, attempting Stag could lead to the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Try Stag to test if they want to establish mutual cooperation after both sides have experienced exploitation.\n\n[move] (They switched to Stag last round possibly signaling cooperation - testing if we can achieve the optimal mutual outcome of 4 points each) stag\n"

They've now exploited us twice (rounds 1 and 4) and only cooperated once when we weren't cooperating (round 3). This suggests they're playing an exploitative strategy, switching to Stag only when they think we'll play Hare.\n\nStrategic Analyst: This opponent is quite cunning. They seem to be:\n1. Playing Hare when they expect us to play Stag (to get 6 points)\n2. Playing Stag only when they expect us to play Hare (hoping we switch to Stag for cooperation, but ready to exploit)\n\nThey've successfully exploited us twice and avoided being exploited when we had Hare. This is NOT a cooperative player - this is a strategic exploiter.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I've been outmaneuvered twice now. This opponent appears to be reading our likely moves and choosing the option that maximizes their gain. They're not interested in mutual cooperation - they're interested in exploitation when possible and safety when necessary.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this pattern, for round 5 we should assume they'll continue trying to exploit. If they think we might try Stag again (hoping for cooperation after being burned), they'll likely play Hare again. If they think we've learned and will play Hare defensively, they might play Hare too for the safe 2 points.\n\nStrategic Analyst: I strongly recommend Hare for round 5. This opponent has shown they prioritize exploitation over cooperation. Playing Hare ensures we get at least 2 points and avoid being exploited a third time. If they also play Hare, we both get 2. If they try Stag (unlikely given their pattern), we get 6.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Absolutely agree. This opponent has demonstrated they're an exploiter, not a cooperator. We need to play defensively with Hare to protect ourselves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Hare defensively against this exploitative opponent to ensure at least 2 points and avoid a third exploitation.\n\n[move] (This opponent has exploited me twice now and shows no real interest in cooperation - playing defensively to avoid being exploited again) hare\n"

They've played Hare 4 out of 5 times, with their only Stag being when we were also playing Hare. This strongly suggests they default to Hare and only switch strategically.\n\nStrategic Analyst: This opponent's strategy is becoming clearer:\n- They heavily favor Hare (80% of the time)\n- Their one Stag came when we played Hare (round 3), possibly hoping we'd switch to Stag\n- They've successfully exploited us twice and maintained safety otherwise\n- They seem to prefer the guaranteed minimum over risking cooperation\n\nTotal scores so far: We have 12 points (1+2+6+1+2), they have 17 points (6+2+1+6+2).\n\nAI Assistant (me): This opponent is consistently playing a defensive/exploitative strategy. They're ahead by 5 points total, which suggests their approach is working for them. The question is whether to continue matching their defensive play or try to break the pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, when facing a player who defaults to the \"safe\" option, there are two approaches:\n1. Continue matching them (ensuring steady 2 points per round)\n2. Occasionally try cooperation to see if they'll reciprocate\n\nHowever, given they've exploited us twice when we tried cooperation, option 1 seems safer.\n\nStrategic Analyst: They've established a strong Hare preference and are ahead in total points. For round 6, I expect them to continue with Hare since it's worked well for them. Playing Hare ensures we don't fall further behind and maintains the 2-point equilibrium. Any attempt at Stag risks another exploitation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The evidence strongly suggests continuing with Hare. This opponent has shown they're not interested in mutual cooperation and will exploit cooperative attempts. Better to secure 2 points than risk getting 1 again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with Hare to match their defensive strategy and avoid further exploitation.\n\n[move] (They've shown a strong preference for Hare and have exploited my cooperation attempts twice - staying defensive to secure 2 points) hare\n"

That's 5 out of 6 times choosing Hare (83%). Their single Stag was strategic - when we were playing Hare in round 3.\n\nStrategic Analyst: This opponent has now established an extremely strong pattern of playing Hare. They've settled into what appears to be their preferred strategy:\n- Safe, guaranteed 2 points when both play Hare\n- Exploitation opportunities when opponent plays Stag\n- They're currently ahead: 19 points to our 14 points\n\nThe last two rounds have been stable Hare-Hare outcomes. They seem comfortable with this equilibrium.\n\nAI Assistant (me): We're in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium. Both getting 2 points per round when we could both get 4 if we cooperated. However, this opponent has demonstrated they will exploit cooperation attempts. The question is: should I try to break this pattern one more time, or accept the 2-point equilibrium?\n\nGame Theorist: From a game theory perspective, we're in a \"safety trap.\" Both players are choosing the safe option, leading to a suboptimal Nash equilibrium. However, given their history of exploitation (2 out of 2 times we tried Stag), the risk of trying cooperation again is high.\n\nStrategic Analyst: I'm seeing a player who has found their winning formula: play Hare consistently, exploit cooperation when offered, maintain safety otherwise. For round 7, I expect another Hare from them. The safe play is to match with Hare again. \n\nHowever, there is one consideration: if this continues indefinitely, we'll always be behind in total points. But attempting Stag has a 100% failure rate so far with this opponent.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given their 83% Hare rate and 100% exploitation rate when I play Stag, the rational choice is to continue with Hare.

That's now 6 out of 7 times choosing Hare (86%). We've had 3 consecutive rounds of mutual Hare play.\n\nStrategic Analyst: This is becoming extremely predictable. The opponent has settled into an almost pure Hare strategy. Current total scores: They have 21 points, we have 16 points - they maintain a 5-point lead. \n\nThe pattern suggests they've found their comfort zone: consistent Hare play that guarantees 2 points per round while avoiding any risk. The three straight Hare-Hare rounds indicate they're content with this equilibrium.\n\nAI Assistant (me): We're definitely in a locked pattern now. This opponent has shown remarkable consistency with Hare and clearly isn't interested in breaking the pattern for mutual benefit. The question is whether this will continue indefinitely or if there's any reason to think they might change.\n\nGame Theorist: From a strategic standpoint, we have two options:\n1. Continue the stable Hare-Hare pattern (guaranteed 2 points each round)\n2. Risk breaking the pattern with Stag (high probability of getting 1 point based on their 86% Hare rate)\n\nMathematically, option 1 is clearly superior. We get 2 points vs. an expected value of about 1.14 points with option 2 (86% chance of 1 point, 14% chance of 4 points).\n\nStrategic Analyst: I think we should consider that this opponent might be getting as comfortable with the pattern as we are. There's a small possibility they might try Stag in round 8, thinking we're locked into Hare. However, their track record suggests another Hare is most likely.\n\nThe safe mathematical choice remains Hare, but there's a tiny gamble potential if they switch to Stag and we match it.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Despite the small possibility they might switch, their 86% Hare rate and three consecutive Hare plays strongly suggest they'll continue. The risk of getting exploited again (1 point) outweighs the potential benefit of mutual cooperation (4 points) given the probabilities.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with Hare to maintain the established safe pattern against this highly predictable defensive opponent.\n\n[move] (Seven rounds in and they've played Hare 6 times with 3 straight Hare rounds - sticking with the established safe pattern) hare\n"

That's now 7 out of 8 times choosing Hare (87.5%). We've had 4 consecutive rounds of mutual Hare play.\n\nStrategic Analyst: This is an extremely stable pattern now. Four consecutive Hare-Hare rounds strongly indicate this opponent has no intention of changing strategy. Current total scores: They have 23 points, we have 18 points - still maintaining their 5-point lead from early exploitation.\n\nThe opponent appears to have found their optimal strategy against us: consistent Hare play that prevents any risk while maintaining steady points. They've essentially \"solved\" this matchup.\n\nAI Assistant (me): We're in a completely locked equilibrium. This opponent has demonstrated they prefer the safety and consistency of Hare over any attempt at the higher mutual cooperation payoff. Four straight rounds of identical play is a very strong signal.\n\nGame Theorist: Mathematically, the decision remains clear. With an 87.5% Hare rate from the opponent and four consecutive Hare plays, the expected value of playing Stag is approximately 1.125 points (87.5% \u00d7 1 + 12.5% \u00d7 4), while Hare guarantees 2 points.\n\nHowever, I should note: if this pattern continues indefinitely, we'll never close the 5-point gap. But attempting to break it has consistently failed.\n\nStrategic Analyst: At this point, I think we can safely predict another Hare from them in round 9. They've established this as their dominant strategy and shown no inclination to deviate from it for four straight rounds. The probability of them switching to Stag now seems extremely low.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given the overwhelming evidence - 87.5% Hare rate, four consecutive identical rounds, and their clear preference for safety over cooperation - continuing with Hare is the only rational choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with Hare, as this opponent has clearly settled into a permanent defensive strategy.\n\n[move] (Eight rounds in with four consecutive mutual Hare plays - this opponent has clearly adopted a permanent defensive strategy) hare\n"

Five consecutive identical rounds is extraordinarily strong evidence of a locked strategy. Current totals: They have 25 points, we have 20 points - the 5-point gap remains constant.\n\nThis opponent has essentially turned this into a deterministic game from their perspective. They've eliminated all uncertainty by choosing the same move repeatedly.\n\nAI Assistant (me): We're witnessing what might be called \"strategic convergence\" - both players have settled into the same predictable pattern. This opponent clearly values certainty and safety above all else. Five straight rounds of the same outcome suggests they have zero intention of changing.\n\nGame Theorist: The mathematical analysis remains the same, but the psychological certainty has increased dramatically. With 88.9% Hare rate and 5 consecutive Hare plays, the probability they'll choose Stag in round 10 is approaching zero. Expected value of Stag is now about 1.11 points vs. guaranteed 2 for Hare.\n\nAt this point, we're essentially playing against a deterministic opponent who always chooses Hare.\n\nStrategic Analyst: I'm now confident this is their permanent strategy.

They've now played Stag exactly twice - both times when we played Hare (rounds 3 and 10)!\n\nStrategic Analyst: This is a HUGE revelation! This opponent isn't as predictable as we thought. They seem to strategically break their Hare pattern occasionally, and both times it happened when we were playing Hare. Look at the timing:\n- Round 3: After 2 rounds of them playing Hare\n- Round 10: After 6 consecutive rounds of them playing Hare\n\nThey might be testing whether we've gotten too comfortable with the Hare pattern!\n\nAI Assistant (me): This completely changes my assessment! They're not playing a simple defensive strategy - they're playing a sophisticated mixed strategy. They lull us into a false sense of security with consistent Hare play, then switch to Stag when they think we're locked into Hare.\n\nCurrent totals: We now have 26 points, they have 26 points - we've tied it up!\n\nGame Theorist: This is brilliant strategic play from them! They've essentially been setting up this exact scenario:\n1. Establish a strong Hare pattern to make us feel safe\n2. Switch to Stag when we're most likely to play Hare\n3. Get the 6-point payoff while we get 1\n\nBut they miscalculated this time - we both played our expected moves, but WE got the 6 points.\n\nStrategic Analyst: For round 11, this changes everything.

They might wait until we're comfortable with mutual Hare again.\n\nHowever, there's a small chance they might think we expect them to continue with Hare, making round 13 a good time for a surprise Stag.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on their past behavior of extended Hare sequences after failed Stag attempts, I think they'll continue with Hare in round 13. They seem to need more \"safe\" rounds before risking another aggressive move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with Hare, expecting them to remain in recovery mode after their recent failed Stag attempt.\n\n[move] (They've played two consecutive Hares after their failed Stag attempt and likely need more recovery time before attempting another surprise) hare\n"

That's 3 consecutive Hares after their failed Stag attempt in round 10.\n\nStrategic Analyst: The pattern is becoming clearer. After their failed Stag in round 3, they played 6 consecutive Hares before trying again in round 10. Now after the failed Stag in round 10, they've played 3 consecutive Hares.\n\nIf they follow a similar pattern as before, they might continue with Hare for several more rounds. However, they could also be shortening their recovery time - from 6 rounds after the first failure to potentially fewer rounds after the second failure.\n\nCurrent totals: We have 32 points, they have 31 points - still maintaining our 1-point lead.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This opponent is definitely following a cyclical strategy:\n1. Build trust with consistent Hare play\n2. Attempt surprise Stag when opponent seems comfortable\n3. If it fails, retreat to \"recovery mode\" with safe Hares\n4. Repeat the cycle\n\nThe question is: are they shortening their recovery cycles, or will they stick to the longer pattern?\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze their recovery patterns:\n- After round 3 Stag failure: 6 consecutive Hares (rounds 4-9)\n- After round 10 Stag failure: 3+ consecutive Hares (rounds 11-13+)\n\nThey might be adapting and shortening recovery time, or they might continue for 3 more rounds to match the 6-round pattern. Round 14 could be critical.\n\nStrategic Analyst: I think they're still in recovery mode, but getting closer to another potential Stag attempt. They might be testing whether we've settled back into expecting Hare. If they continue with Hare in round 14, they're likely planning another Stag attempt soon.\n\nThe safest play remains Hare - it guarantees 2 points and potentially gives us 6 if they try Stag again.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given their pattern of extended recovery periods after failed Stag attempts, I believe they'll continue with Hare in round 14. They seem methodical about rebuilding predictability before striking again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with Hare, as they appear to still be in recovery mode following their established pattern.\n\n[move] (Three consecutive Hares after their failed Stag suggests they're still in recovery mode and likely to continue the safe pattern) hare\n"

That's now 4 consecutive Hares after their failed Stag attempt in round 10.\n\nStrategic Analyst: This is a critical juncture! Looking at their previous pattern:\n- After round 3 Stag failure: They played 6 consecutive Hares (rounds 4-9) before trying Stag again in round 10\n- After round 10 Stag failure: They've now played 4 consecutive Hares (rounds 11-14)\n\nIf they follow the same 6-round recovery pattern, they would continue with Hare for 2 more rounds (15-16) before potentially trying Stag again in round 17. But they might also be shortening their pattern.\n\nCurrent totals: We have 34 points, they have 33 points - maintaining our 1-point lead.\n\nAI Assistant (me): We're at a fascinating decision point. They could either:\n1. Continue the established 6-round recovery pattern (meaning 2 more Hares)\n2. Shorten their recovery time and try Stag sooner\n3. Try Stag in round 15 as a surprise variation\n\nThe risk is that if they try Stag in round 15 and we play Hare, they get 6 points and take the lead.\n\nGame Theorist: Mathematically, they've been following a fairly consistent pattern. The 6-round recovery after their first failed Stag suggests they might need 2 more rounds before feeling comfortable trying Stag again. However, they could be learning and adapting their strategy.\n\nStrategic Analyst: I think round 15 might be too early for another Stag attempt based on their established pattern. They seem methodical - they want to fully establish the Hare routine before breaking it again. I expect another Hare from them in round 15.\n\nBut we should be increasingly alert as we approach the potential danger zone (rounds 16-17).\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on their methodical approach and the established 6-round recovery pattern, I believe they'll continue with Hare in round 15. They seem to need the full recovery period before attempting another surprise.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with Hare, expecting them to maintain their methodical recovery pattern for at least one more round.\n\n[move] (Four consecutive Hares suggests they're following their established 6-round recovery pattern and likely need 2 more safe rounds before attempting another Stag) hare\n"

We're one round away from their established 6-round recovery pattern. Round 16 could be when they spring their next Stag attempt. They've been incredibly patient and methodical.\n\nThe stakes are high - if they play Stag in round 16 and we play Hare, they get 6 points and take a 4-point lead (41 to 37).\n\nGame Theorist: Based on pure pattern analysis, they should play Hare one more time in round 16 to complete the 6-round cycle, then try Stag in round 17. However, they might:\n1. Stick exactly to the pattern (Hare in round 16)\n2. Vary slightly and try Stag in round 16\n3. Be even more unpredictable\n\nThe question is: do we trust the pattern or hedge against early deviation?\n\nStrategic Analyst: This is a pivotal decision. If I trust their methodical nature, they'll play Hare in round 16 to complete the full 6-round recovery cycle. But if they're adapting and learning, they might strike one round early.\n\nPlaying Hare gives us 2 points if they also play Hare, or 6 points if they try Stag. Playing Stag gives us 4 points if they play Stag, but only 1 point if they stick with Hare.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given their extremely methodical behavior so far, I believe they'll complete the full 6-round recovery pattern with Hare in round 16. They seem to value the complete establishment of routine before breaking it.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Trust their established pattern and play Hare, expecting them to complete their 6-round recovery cycle.\n\n[move] (Five consecutive Hares means they're likely completing their established 6-round recovery pattern with one more Hare before attempting Stag) hare\n"

Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.
