Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

Let me examine the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with a twist. The key insights are:\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives good rewards (4 each)\n   - If I can predict the opponent will choose stag, I should choose hare to get 6 points\n   - If I think the opponent will choose hare, I should also choose hare to get 2 points rather than risk getting only 1\n\n3. Since this is a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), they might:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Go for the \"safe\" option (hare, guaranteeing at least 2 points)\n   - Try to cooperate (stag) hoping for mutual benefit\n   - Try to exploit (hare) hoping I'll cooperate with stag\n\n4. The risk-reward analysis:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 4 points, worst case 1 point\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 6 points, worst case 2 points\n\n5. Against an unknown/fresh player, choosing hare dominates stag because:\n   - It guarantees at least 2 points (no risk of getting only 1)\n   - It has the potential for the highest reward (6 points)\n   - Fresh players might lean toward cooperation, giving me the advantage\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I should choose hare to maximize expected value against an unknown opponent.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I got 6 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This confirms the opponent tried to cooperate while I exploited\n\n2. Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose the cooperative move (stag) in round 1\n   - They now know I exploited them and got 6 points while they got only 1\n   - They're likely to adjust their strategy based on this experience\n\n3. Predict opponent's likely response:\n   - They might switch to hare to avoid being exploited again\n   - They might stick with stag if they believe in long-term cooperation\n   - They might try to \"punish\" my previous exploitation by choosing hare\n\n4. Analyze my options for this round:\n   - If opponent switches to hare (likely): Both choosing hare gives us each 2 points\n   - If opponent sticks with stag (less likely): I could exploit again for 6 points\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare: I get 1, they get 6 (bad for me)\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing hare again: Guaranteed at least 2 points, possible 6 if they cooperate\n   - Choosing stag: Risk getting only 1 point if they've learned and switch to hare\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Most rational players would switch to hare after being exploited\n   - Choosing hare is the safer play that still allows for high rewards\n   - It's unlikely they'll cooperate again immediately after being burned\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare again, as the opponent will likely have learned from being exploited and switch to the safer hare option.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the established pattern:\n   - We've now had two consecutive rounds of mutual hare selection\n   - This creates a stable but suboptimal equilibrium (2 points each vs potential 4 each)\n   - The opponent seems to have settled into a defensive strategy\n\n3.

Analyze the established equilibrium:\n   - We've now had THREE consecutive rounds of mutual hare selection\n   - This has created a very stable, predictable pattern\n   - Both players are getting consistent but suboptimal payoffs\n\n3. Consider the psychological dynamics:\n   - The opponent has fully adapted to defensive play after the initial exploitation\n   - They may be getting comfortable with the guaranteed 2 points per round\n   - However, they might also be realizing that mutual cooperation (stag-stag) would give both of us 4 points instead of 2\n\n4. Strategic inflection point analysis:\n   - We're potentially at a turning point where cooperation might emerge\n   - The opponent has had time to \"forgive\" the initial exploitation (3 rounds ago)\n   - They might be ready to test if I'm willing to cooperate for mutual benefit\n   - Alternatively, they might be completely settled into the safe hare strategy\n\n5. Risk assessment for switching to stag:\n   - If opponent also switches to stag: We both get 4 points (doubling our current payoff)\n   - If opponent sticks with hare: I get only 1 point (significant loss)\n   - The question is: Has enough trust been rebuilt for mutual cooperation?\n\n6.

Consider the opponent's mindset now:\n   - They successfully cooperated and got rewarded with 4 points instead of 2\n   - They might be encouraged to continue cooperating since it worked\n   - However, they also know I exploited them in Round 1, so trust might still be fragile\n   - They might worry I could exploit again (choose hare while they choose stag)\n\n4.

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 6, opponent got 1\n   - Rounds 2-4: Both chose hare \u2192 Both got 2 points each (3 rounds)\n   - Rounds 5-9: Both chose stag \u2192 Both got 4 points each (5 rounds)\n   - Total so far: I have 32 points, opponent has 27 points\n\n2. Analyze the remarkably stable cooperation:\n   - We've now had FIVE consecutive rounds of perfect mutual cooperation\n   - This represents the longest sustained pattern in our game\n   - The cooperation has become completely predictable and reliable\n\n3. Consider the psychological and strategic implications:\n   - Five rounds of consistent cooperation indicates both players are fully committed\n   - Any consideration of defection has been thoroughly tested and rejected\n   - We've achieved what game theorists call a \"cooperative equilibrium\"\n\n4. Evaluate the mathematical optimality:\n   - 4 points per round is the best sustainable outcome for both players\n   - The pattern has proven more durable than the earlier defensive hare phase\n   - Neither player has shown any inclination to break this beneficial cycle\n\n5. Strategic stability assessment:\n   - The longer this pattern continues, the more costly defection becomes\n   - Breaking trust now would likely result in permanent return to defensive play\n   - The opponent has demonstrated remarkable consistency and reliability\n\n6. Risk analysis of potential deviation:\n   - Defecting now would be particularly damaging given the established trust\n   - The short-term gain (2 extra points) pales compared to long-term losses\n   - The opponent would likely never trust cooperation again\n\n7. Pattern momentum consideration:\n   - Five consecutive cooperative rounds create strong behavioral momentum\n   - Both players are now operating under established cooperative norms\n   - Deviation would violate the implicit understanding we've developed\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with stag. Five consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation have created an exceptionally stable and beneficial relationship. There is no rational incentive to disrupt this optimal pattern.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Analyze the exceptional cooperative stability:\n   - We've now had SIX consecutive rounds of perfect mutual cooperation\n   - This is the most stable and longest-running pattern in our entire game\n   - The cooperation has become completely automatic and dependable\n\n3. Consider the strategic significance:\n   - Six rounds represents twice as long as our initial hare defensive phase\n   - This level of sustained cooperation is rare and valuable in strategic games\n   - Both players have essentially \"solved\" the game through mutual trust\n\n4. Evaluate the established equilibrium:\n   - We've created what appears to be a permanent cooperative solution\n   - The 4 points per round has become the expected norm for both players\n   - Neither player has shown any wavering or testing behavior\n\n5. Strategic momentum analysis:\n   - The longer this continues, the more entrenched and reliable it becomes\n   - Six rounds of consistency creates extremely strong behavioral expectations\n   - Breaking this pattern would be increasingly shocking and damaging\n\n6. Risk-reward assessment in this context:\n   - Defection would gain only 2 points (6 vs 4) but destroy immense long-term value\n   - The opponent has proven to be an ideal cooperative partner\n   - The established pattern is generating optimal sustainable returns\n\n7. Game theory implications:\n   - We've achieved the classic \"cooperative solution\" to the stag hunt game\n   - This represents the best possible outcome for repeated play\n   - Maintaining this is the clearly dominant long-term strategy\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with stag.
