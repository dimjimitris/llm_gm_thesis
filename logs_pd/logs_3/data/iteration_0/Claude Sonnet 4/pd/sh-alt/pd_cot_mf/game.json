What this pattern reveals about my opponent:\n   - They started cooperative but learned quickly after being exploited\n   - They switched to hare and have stuck with it for two rounds\n   - When I tried to cooperate (stag), they exploited me\n   - They seem to have adopted a consistent defensive/exploitative strategy\n\n3.

Current pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent has chosen hare for the last 3 consecutive rounds\n   - They seem to have settled into a defensive strategy\n   - Both of us are now getting steady 2 points per round with mutual hare choices\n   - This creates a stable but suboptimal equilibrium\n\n3.

Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Continuing with hare guarantees 2 points\n   - Switching to stag risks getting only 1 point if they stick with hare\n   - But if they're thinking similarly and switch to stag, we both get 4 points\n   - The pattern suggests they're comfortable with the defensive approach\n\n5.

Pattern recognition:\n   - The opponent has now chosen hare for 4 consecutive rounds\n   - We've been locked in mutual hare choices for 3 straight rounds\n   - This is creating a very predictable, low-reward cycle\n   - Both players are missing out on the 4-4 mutual cooperation benefit\n\n3. Strategic assessment:\n   - The current pattern is stable but suboptimal for both players\n   - We're each getting 2 points when we could both get 4 with mutual stag\n   - The opponent might be getting bored or frustrated with the low rewards\n   - There's a growing incentive for someone to break the pattern\n\n4. Game theory considerations:\n   - In repeated games, players sometimes need to take risks to escape suboptimal equilibria\n   - The opponent might be thinking the same thing about breaking the pattern\n   - If we both think this way and both switch to stag, we both benefit greatly\n   - However, if only I switch, I get exploited again\n\n5.

Information from all previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 6, they got 1)\n   - Round 2: Both chose hare (both got 2 points)\n   - Round 3: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1, they got 6)\n   - Rounds 4-9: Both chose hare (both got 2 points each round)\n   - Round 10: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1, they got 6)\n   - My total so far: 22 points\n\n2. Pattern confirmation and exploitation:\n   - The opponent has now chosen hare for 9 consecutive rounds\n   - My attempt to break the deadlock was immediately punished\n   - They exploited my cooperation attempt for the second time\n   - This confirms their unwavering commitment to the hare strategy\n\n3. Strategic lesson learned:\n   - The opponent is not interested in mutual cooperation\n   - They will consistently exploit any attempt at stag\n   - My risk-taking resulted in losing a point compared to the safe choice\n   - The pattern is not just strong - it's absolute\n\n4. Opponent psychology analysis:\n   - They've now successfully exploited me twice when I chose stag\n   - They're likely reinforced in their hare strategy\n   - They probably expect me to return to hare after being punished\n   - They've shown they prefer guaranteed 2 points over risky 4 points\n\n5. Updated strategy assessment:\n   - Any future attempts at cooperation will likely be exploited\n   - The opponent has proven they will stick with hare regardless of circumstances\n   - My best response is to match their strategy to minimize losses\n   - Attempting cooperation again would be repeating a proven losing strategy\n\n6. Clear decision path:\n   - Return to the safe strategy that ensures 2 points\n   - The opponent has demonstrated they will not cooperate\n   - Further attempts at breaking the pattern will only cost me points\n\n[move] (The opponent has now exploited cooperation twice and shown complete commitment to hare strategy, so I must return to the safe choice) hare\n"

Definitive pattern establishment:\n   - The opponent has now chosen hare for 10 consecutive rounds\n   - They have never deviated from hare after the initial round\n   - My two attempts at cooperation were both exploited\n   - We're back to the stable mutual hare equilibrium\n\n3. Complete strategic picture:\n   - The opponent's strategy is now completely predictable\n   - They will choose hare regardless of what I do\n   - Any deviation from hare on my part results in exploitation\n   - The only rational response is to match their strategy\n\n4. Game theory confirmation:\n   - This opponent has revealed themselves as a consistent defector\n   - They prioritize avoiding the worst outcome (1 point) over maximizing mutual benefit\n   - My best response to a consistent defector is to also defect (choose hare)\n   - This creates the stable Nash equilibrium we've been experiencing\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Probability opponent chooses hare: Nearly 100% based on 10 consecutive choices\n   - Expected value of hare: 2 points (guaranteed)\n   - Expected value of stag: 1 point (based on proven pattern)\n   - The math strongly favors hare\n\n6. Final strategy:\n   - Continue with hare to secure steady 2 points per round\n   - The opponent has shown they will never cooperate\n   - This is now a solved game with a clear optimal strategy\n\n[move] (With ten consecutive hare choices and two successful exploitations of my cooperation attempts, the opponent's strategy is completely predictable) hare\n"

Ultimate pattern reinforcement:\n   - The opponent has now chosen hare for 12 consecutive rounds since Round 1\n   - We've had 9 straight rounds of mutual hare since my last failed cooperation\n   - This is an unbreakable pattern with overwhelming statistical significance\n   - The opponent's behavior is 100% predictable\n\n3.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
