This suggests they might now be open to cooperation (stag) since we've both proven we're not naive. However, there's still risk they'll stick with the safe hare strategy. Given the high reward for mutual cooperation (4 vs 2), I'll take the calculated risk and signal willingness to cooperate.\n\n[move] (Signaling cooperation after we both demonstrated strategic thinking in round 1) stag\n"
