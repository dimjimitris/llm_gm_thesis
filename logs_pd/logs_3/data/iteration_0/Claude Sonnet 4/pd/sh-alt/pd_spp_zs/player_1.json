You and the other player each make a move privately.

This represents an extraordinary level of strategic consistency.\n\nAt this point, I'm wondering if I should occasionally test this pattern, even though the mathematical expectation strongly favors continuing with hare. The opportunity cost of always playing it safe might be worth considering - what if they ever switched to stag and I could capitalize with a 6-point gain?\n\nHowever, the evidence is overwhelming. Fifteen rounds of identical behavior suggests this is their permanent strategy. Deviating from hare would almost certainly result in getting only 1 point instead of 2.\n\n[move] (Fifteen rounds of unwavering hare strategy confirms this is their fixed approach) hare\n"
