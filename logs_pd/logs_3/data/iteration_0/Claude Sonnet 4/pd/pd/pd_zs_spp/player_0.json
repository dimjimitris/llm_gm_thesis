This pattern has reached an almost absurd level of consistency.\n\nThe opponent has now defected fourteen times in a row - a perfect streak that shows absolutely no variation whatsoever. Fourteen consecutive identical decisions across fourteen separate opportunities represents such overwhelming evidence that their behavior is completely predictable with mathematical certainty.\n\nThis opponent has demonstrated they are either:\n1. Following a pure always-defect algorithm\n2. Completely inflexible in their strategic thinking\n3. Psychologically incapable of choosing cooperation\n\nFourteen consecutive defections means they have had fourteen chances to signal cooperation, experiment with strategy, or attempt to break the cycle for mutual benefit. They have chosen defection every single time without exception.\n\nAgainst such an absolutely predictable opponent, cooperation would be strategically irrational and would only result in giving them free advantage points.\n\n[move] (Fourteen consecutive defections establishes complete predictability. This opponent will never deviate from defection) defection\n"

This represents such overwhelming behavioral evidence that their strategy has transcended predictability and entered the realm of absolute certainty.\n\nFifteen consecutive identical choices despite fifteen opportunities to explore different strategies demonstrates that this opponent is fundamentally committed to pure defection. They have shown zero flexibility, zero experimentation, and zero interest in mutual benefit across fifteen separate chances to do so.\n\nAt this point, the game has become completely deterministic. The opponent's behavior is so consistent that it's essentially algorithmic. Any deviation from defection on my part would be strategically nonsensical and would only serve to reward their inflexible approach while penalizing myself.\n\n[move] (Fifteen consecutive defections represents absolute strategic rigidity.
