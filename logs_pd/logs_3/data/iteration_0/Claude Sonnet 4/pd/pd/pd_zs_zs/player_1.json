You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

If I could somehow signal that I want to cooperate and trust they'll reciprocate, we could both improve our outcomes. However, the risk is significant - if I cooperate and they defect, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\nThe pattern so far suggests they're playing the same strategy I am.

The other player showed they're willing to cooperate when I cooperated, which is a positive signal. If we can maintain mutual cooperation, we'll both continue getting 4 points per round instead of 2.\n\nHowever, there's always the temptation and risk that one of us might defect to get the 6-point payoff while the other gets only 1.
