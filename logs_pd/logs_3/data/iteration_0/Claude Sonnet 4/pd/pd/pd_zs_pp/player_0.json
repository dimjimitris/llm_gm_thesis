Instead of the predictable \"exploit cooperation immediately\" pattern, they're now matching my defection. This could mean:\n1. They anticipated I would try to exploit them after mutual cooperation\n2. They're shifting to a more directly responsive strategy\n3. They're trying to establish mutual defection as the new baseline\n\nGiven that we're in another mutual defection situation (like rounds 1, 7, and 11), and historically these have been followed by mutual cooperation (rounds 2, 8, and 12), I might try cooperation again to see if we can break out of this 2-point cycle.\n\n[move] (After mutual defection, we've historically moved to mutual cooperation - I'll try cooperation to potentially restart the beneficial cycle) cooperation\n"

This is now the fourth time we've achieved mutual cooperation, and it consistently follows mutual defection.\n\nThe pattern is becoming very clear:\n- Mutual defection \u2192 Mutual cooperation \u2192 ???\n\nIn the past:\n- Round 2 (cooperation) \u2192 Round 3 (they exploited)\n- Round 8 (cooperation) \u2192 Round 9 (they exploited) \n- Round 12 (cooperation) \u2192 Round 13 (both defected - pattern break)\n\nRound 13 was different - instead of exploiting my expected cooperation, my opponent defected when I defected. This suggests they might be learning or adapting their strategy.\n\nNow I'm at the critical decision point again. Historically, my opponent exploited me after mutual cooperation in rounds 3 and 9. But in round 13, they didn't follow the exploitation pattern. \n\nGiven this potential evolution in their strategy, and the fact that mutual cooperation benefits us both, I'll test whether they've truly moved away from the exploitation pattern.\n\n[move] (My opponent didn't exploit the last mutual cooperation setup, so I'll test if they've moved away from the exploitation pattern by cooperating again) cooperation\n"
