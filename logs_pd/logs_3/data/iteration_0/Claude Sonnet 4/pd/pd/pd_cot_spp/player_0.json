Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Current situation assessment:\n   - We're locked in a mutual defection cycle\n   - Neither player is taking risks anymore\n   - This gives steady but low returns (2 points each)\n   - The opponent appears to be playing it safe after the earlier back-and-forth\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - I have a significant point lead (22 vs opponent's approximate 18)\n   - Continued mutual defection maintains my lead with low risk\n   - If I cooperate, there's risk the opponent will exploit me (1 point vs their 6)\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate too, we both get 4 points (better than 2)\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Cooperating: Risk of 1 point, potential for 4 points\n   - Defecting: Guaranteed 2 points if they defect, 6 points if they cooperate\n   - Given recent behavior, opponent will likely defect again\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown no recent inclination to cooperate\n   - They seem committed to the safe defection strategy\n   - I'm ahead in points, so maintaining steady 2-point gains is acceptable\n   - The risk of cooperation is too high given their recent defensive play\n   - I should continue with the safe strategy\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with defection since the opponent appears committed to defensive play and I want to maintain my lead safely.\n\n[move] (The opponent has settled into defensive defection for two rounds, so I'll continue playing it safe to maintain my point lead) defection\n"

Recognizing the cyclical pattern:\n   - The opponent seems to follow a cycle: exploit my cooperation, then try cooperation themselves\n   - They exploited me in round 11, then cooperated in round 12\n   - This mirrors earlier rounds where they would cooperate after exploiting me\n   - They might be testing if I'll reciprocate after they show vulnerability\n\n4.
