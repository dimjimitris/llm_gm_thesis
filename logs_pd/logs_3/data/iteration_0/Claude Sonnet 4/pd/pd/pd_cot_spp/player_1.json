    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

The fresh player also chose defection in the first round. This gives us valuable information about their strategy. They either:\n1. Reasoned similarly to us about the Nash equilibrium\n2. Are playing a cautious/defensive strategy\n3. Got lucky with a random choice that happened to be optimal\n\nSince we're now in a multi-round game, we need to shift from single-shot thinking to iterated game theory. The question is whether this player will stick with defection or might switch strategies.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** The fact that both players defected suggests this opponent may not be as \"fresh\" as initially thought, or they're naturally inclined toward defensive play. In iterated games, we have several strategic options:\n1. Continue defecting (safe but suboptimal if they switch to cooperation)\n2. Try cooperation to test if they'll reciprocate for mutual benefit\n3. Use a tit-for-tat strategy\n\nGiven that we both scored 2 points when we could have both scored 4 points with mutual cooperation, there's potential value in testing cooperation.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** This is a classic dilemma in iterated games. If I cooperate now and they defect again, I get only 1 point while they get 6. But if I cooperate and they also cooperate, we both get 4 points each - doubling our previous score. The risk is significant, but the potential reward is substantial.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** In iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, one effective strategy is to occasionally offer cooperation to break out of mutual defection cycles. Since the opponent chose defection in round 1, they might be testing my strategy too. If I show willingness to cooperate, they might reciprocate in future rounds.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Let's consider the risk calculation: If I defect again, we'll likely both get 2 points again. If I cooperate and they defect, I lose 1 point relative to mutual defection, but I gain information about their strategy. If I cooperate and they also cooperate, we both gain 2 points relative to mutual defection. The potential upside outweighs the downside risk.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Based on this analysis, I think cooperation is worth trying. It's a calculated risk that could lead to much better outcomes for both players in subsequent rounds.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Cooperation - testing if the opponent will reciprocate for mutual benefit in this iterated game.\n\n[move] (Testing cooperation to see if we can achieve mutual benefit instead of staying stuck in mutual defection) cooperation\n"

This reveals important information about their strategy - they're either playing pure defection or they're exploiting cooperative gestures. My total score is now 3 points (2+1) while theirs is likely 8 points (2+6).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a classic scenario in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. The opponent has shown they will exploit cooperation, at least for now. I have several strategic options:\n1. Punish their defection by defecting (tit-for-tat response)\n2. Try cooperation once more to see if they learned mutual benefit is better\n3. Switch to permanent defection to avoid further exploitation\n\nGiven they've defected twice, including when I offered cooperation, they seem committed to a defection strategy. Continuing to cooperate would likely result in continued exploitation.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** The opponent has clearly demonstrated they will take advantage of cooperative moves. While I'm behind in points, continuing to offer cooperation when they consistently defect would be strategically poor. I need to protect myself from further exploitation while still leaving room for potential future cooperation if they change strategy.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** A tit-for-tat approach makes sense here - mirror their previous move. Since they defected last round, I should defect this round. This sends a clear signal that I won't be exploited repeatedly, while still allowing for cooperation if they switch strategies in future rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly. Tit-for-tat is one of the most successful strategies in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments. It's \"nice\" (starts with cooperation), \"retaliatory\" (punishes defection), \"forgiving\" (returns to cooperation when opponent does), and \"clear\" (easy to understand pattern). Since I already tried cooperation and they exploited it, defection is the appropriate response.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Based on their consistent defection pattern and exploitation of my cooperation attempt, defection is the rational choice to avoid further point losses while signaling I won't be taken advantage of.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Defection - responding to their exploitation with defensive play using tit-for-tat strategy.\n\n[move] (Opponent has defected twice including exploiting my cooperation attempt, so I must respond defensively to avoid further exploitation) defection\n"

The opponent has defected in all three rounds: Round 1 (both defected), Round 2 (they defected while I cooperated), Round 3 (both defected again). My total score is 5 points (2+1+2) while theirs is likely 10 points (2+6+2). They seem committed to a pure defection strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This opponent appears to be playing a \"always defect\" strategy, which is rational in single-shot games but suboptimal in iterated games when mutual cooperation is possible. The question is whether I should:\n1. Continue defecting to minimize losses (guaranteed 2 points per round)\n2. Try cooperation again to test if they might change strategy\n3. Accept that this is likely a defection-only opponent and optimize accordingly\n\nGiven their consistent pattern, another cooperation attempt seems risky, but in iterated games, occasionally testing for cooperation can be valuable.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** The opponent has shown no willingness to cooperate even when I offered it. They exploited my cooperation in Round 2 and returned to mutual defection in Round 3. While I could try cooperation again, the evidence strongly suggests they're playing a pure defection strategy.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** However, consider this: if this opponent truly always defects, then my choice doesn't affect their behavior - they'll defect regardless. In that case, defection minimizes my losses. But if there's even a small chance they might eventually reciprocate cooperation, the potential payoff (4 points vs 2 points) is significant. The question is whether the risk of losing 1 more point is worth the potential gain of 2 points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the strong pattern of defection, I lean toward continuing to defect. This opponent has had multiple opportunities to cooperate and hasn't taken them. Maintaining defection protects against further exploitation while still allowing me to respond if they ever signal willingness to cooperate.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Based on three rounds of consistent defection behavior, including exploiting my cooperation attempt, the safest and most rational approach is to continue defecting. This minimizes losses against what appears to be a committed defector.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Defection - opponent has established a clear pattern of always defecting, so I should protect against further exploitation.\n\n[move] (Opponent has consistently defected in all three rounds including exploiting my cooperation, indicating a pure defection strategy) defection\n"

The opponent cooperated for the first time in Round 4 while I defected, giving me 6 points and them only 1 point. This completely changes the dynamic. My total score is now 11 points (2+1+2+6) while theirs is likely 11 points as well (2+6+2+1). We're tied, but more importantly, they've finally shown willingness to cooperate.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a critical moment in the game. The opponent's cooperation could mean several things:\n1. They're testing a tit-for-tat strategy (cooperating after I defected might seem odd, but maybe they're trying to break the cycle)\n2. They're trying to establish mutual cooperation going forward\n3. They made a strategic error or random choice\n4. They're trying to signal a change in strategy\n\nThe key question is: how should I respond to this cooperative gesture?\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** This is exactly the kind of moment where my strategy matters most. The opponent finally cooperated, breaking their pattern of pure defection. If I defect again, I signal that I won't reciprocate cooperation, potentially locking us back into mutual defection. If I cooperate, I signal willingness to pursue mutual benefit.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** The tit-for-tat strategy would suggest I should cooperate in response to their cooperation. This could initiate a cycle of mutual cooperation where we both get 4 points per round instead of 2. Even though I just gained an advantage by scoring 6 points while they got 1, future mutual cooperation (4,4) is better than mutual defection (2,2).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly. This is a potential turning point. The opponent may have realized that pure defection isn't optimal in an iterated game and is now offering an olive branch. Reciprocating with cooperation could establish a mutually beneficial pattern. The risk is minimal - if they defect next round, I'm back to where I would have been anyway.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Given that this is the first time they've cooperated, and cooperation could lead to better outcomes for both of us going forward, I should reciprocate. This signals that I'm willing to move toward mutual benefit rather than staying locked in suboptimal outcomes.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Cooperation - reciprocating their first cooperative move to potentially establish mutual cooperation pattern.\n\n[move] (Opponent finally cooperated after three rounds of defection, so I should reciprocate to potentially establish mutually beneficial cooperation) cooperation\n"

The opponent cooperated once in Round 4, which I reciprocated in Round 5, but then they immediately defected again. This looks like a deliberate pattern of exploitation. My total score is now 12 points (2+1+2+6+1) while theirs is likely 17 points (2+6+2+1+6). They're ahead by 5 points and have shown they will exploit any cooperative gesture.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is becoming clearer - the opponent appears to be playing a more sophisticated strategy than pure defection. They may be using what's called \"alternating exploitation\" - occasionally cooperating to bait cooperation, then immediately defecting to exploit it. This is actually worse than pure defection because it actively punishes any attempt at mutual benefit.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** I've now tried cooperation twice (Rounds 2 and 5) and been exploited both times. The opponent has only cooperated once (Round 4) and immediately returned to defection when I reciprocated. This suggests they're not interested in establishing mutual cooperation - they're specifically trying to exploit cooperative gestures.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** The pattern is concerning:\n- Round 1: Both defect (2,2)\n- Round 2: I cooperate, they defect (1,6) - First exploitation\n- Round 3: Both defect (2,2)\n- Round 4: I defect, they cooperate (6,1) - They test cooperation\n- Round 5: I cooperate, they defect (1,6) - Second exploitation\n\nThey're clearly punishing cooperation attempts. I need to stop offering opportunities for exploitation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** At this point, given their demonstrated pattern of exploiting cooperation, the rational response is to defect and maintain defection until they show sustained cooperative behavior, not just single-round cooperation followed by immediate defection. They've proven untrustworthy with cooperative gestures.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** I've given this opponent multiple chances to establish mutual cooperation, and they've consistently exploited those opportunities.

Are they genuinely trying to establish cooperation, or is this a deliberate pattern of baiting and exploiting?\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Given the established pattern, I strongly suspect this is bait again. If I cooperate in Round 7, based on the previous pattern, they'll likely defect and exploit me for the third time. The evidence suggests they're playing a strategy of: cooperate to bait cooperation, then defect to exploit, repeat.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This appears to be a form of \"sucker's gambit\" - repeatedly offering cooperation to see if the opponent will keep falling for exploitation. The rational response is to not take the bait. I should defect again and see if they continue this pattern or finally commit to sustained cooperation.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Based on the clear pattern of exploitation following my cooperative responses, I should not fall for this apparent bait again. If they truly want cooperation, they need to demonstrate sustained cooperative behavior, not just single-round cooperation followed by immediate exploitation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Defection - the opponent appears to be using cooperation as bait for exploitation based on the established pattern.\n\n[move] (Opponent is showing the same pattern as Round 4 - cooperating once then likely to exploit if I reciprocate, so I will not fall for this bait again) defection\n"

We remain tied. The pattern suggests they may have expected me to cooperate in Round 7 and were prepared to exploit again, but since I defected, we both got 2 points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is interesting. The opponent didn't cooperate in Round 7 like they did in Rounds 4 and 6. This could mean:\n1. They're adjusting their strategy after I didn't fall for the bait in Round 6\n2. They're testing a different pattern\n3. They've given up on trying to establish cooperation\n4. They're preparing for another cooperation attempt\n\nThe key question is: will they return to their baiting pattern or have they shifted to pure defection?\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** The opponent has shown they're willing to exploit cooperation when offered, but they've also shown they will occasionally cooperate themselves. However, every time I've reciprocated their cooperation, they've immediately exploited it. I need to be very careful about when and if to offer cooperation again.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Given that we're tied at 20 points each, and considering their demonstrated pattern of exploitation, I think the safest approach is to continue defecting until they show sustained cooperative behavior - meaning they cooperate for multiple consecutive rounds without exploiting any reciprocation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. The opponent has trained me, through their behavior, that cooperation will be exploited. Until they prove otherwise through sustained cooperative behavior, defection remains the rational choice. If they truly want mutual cooperation, they need to demonstrate commitment to it, not just use it as bait.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Based on their established pattern of using cooperation as bait for exploitation, and the fact that they defected in Round 7, I should continue with defection to protect against further exploitation while remaining ready to respond if they show genuine sustained cooperation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Defection - opponent has established a pattern of exploiting cooperation and hasn't shown sustained cooperative commitment.\n\n[move] (Opponent has consistently exploited my cooperation attempts and hasn't demonstrated sustained cooperative behavior, so I must continue protecting against exploitation) defection\n"

My total score is 22 points (2+1+2+6+1+6+2+2) while theirs is likely 22 points as well (2+6+2+1+6+1+2+2). We remain tied. The pattern over 8 rounds shows:\n- Rounds 1, 3, 7, 8: Mutual defection (2,2)\n- Rounds 2, 5: I cooperated, they defected (1,6) - exploitations\n- Rounds 4, 6: They cooperated, I defected (6,1)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We're settling into what appears to be mutual defection again. The opponent seems to have stopped their cooperation-baiting pattern after I didn't fall for it in Round 6. This could be a stable state, but it's suboptimal for both of us. We're both getting 2 points per round when we could both get 4 points with mutual cooperation.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** The question is whether this opponent is capable of sustained cooperation or if they'll always revert to exploitation. They've shown they will exploit any cooperative gesture I make, but they've also shown they will occasionally cooperate themselves. The challenge is that I can't trust them to maintain cooperation even if I reciprocate.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Here's a strategic consideration: if we continue mutual defection indefinitely, we'll both keep getting 2 points per round. But if there's any chance they might be willing to establish genuine mutual cooperation, the payoff would be significant. However, given their history of exploitation, any cooperation attempt is risky.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** In iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, sometimes breaking a mutual defection cycle requires someone to take a calculated risk. However, this opponent has specifically punished such risk-taking. I'm torn between:\n1. Maintaining safe defection to avoid exploitation\n2. Testing cooperation one more time to see if the pattern has changed\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Given their consistent history of exploiting cooperation, and the fact that we just had two rounds of mutual defection, I think it's premature to risk cooperation again.

My total score is 24 points while theirs is also 24 points. We remain tied. This mutual defection streak suggests we may be settling into a stable but suboptimal equilibrium. Over 9 rounds, the pattern shows the opponent has exploited my cooperation twice and I've exploited theirs twice, with the rest being mutual defection.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This extended mutual defection phase indicates that both players may have \"learned\" to avoid cooperation due to past exploitation. However, this creates a classic coordination problem - we're both getting 2 points per round when we could both get 4 points with mutual cooperation. The question is whether either of us is willing to risk breaking this cycle.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** I'm in a strategic deadlock. The opponent has proven they will exploit cooperation, so I'm reluctant to cooperate. But this mutual defection is giving us both suboptimal outcomes. We're essentially in a trust breakdown situation where both sides are playing it safe but missing potential mutual gains.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Consider this: we've now had enough rounds that the opponent might have also learned that pure exploitation isn't sustainable in the long run. They may be as frustrated with the mutual defection as I am. If they're rational, they should recognize that establishing trust for mutual cooperation would benefit both of us.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's a key insight: in long iterated games, occasionally testing cooperation can be valuable even after trust has broken down. The risk is 1 point (if they exploit), but the potential long-term gain is significant if it leads to sustained mutual cooperation. However, timing matters - I should only do this if I believe there's a reasonable chance they've also learned from the suboptimal outcomes.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** The extended mutual defection might actually create an opportunity. Both of us are stuck getting 2 points per round. If the opponent is rational, they should also be considering whether to break this cycle. But given their history, I'm still hesitant to be the first to cooperate and risk exploitation again.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** I think one more round of defection is appropriate. If this pattern continues much longer, the game becomes purely about minimizing losses rather than maximizing gains. But I'm not ready to risk cooperation just yet.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Defection - maintaining the current pattern while observing if opponent shows any signs of wanting to break the mutual defection cycle.\n\n[move] (Extended mutual defection continues as neither player has signaled willingness to risk establishing trust for mutual cooperation) defection\n"

My total score is 26 points while theirs is also 26 points. We remain tied. This is becoming a very stable but clearly suboptimal pattern. Over the last 4 rounds alone, we've each earned 8 points when we could have earned 16 points with mutual cooperation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This extended mutual defection is a classic example of how rational individual decisions can lead to collectively irrational outcomes. We're both \"safely\" earning 2 points per round to avoid the risk of earning 1 point, but we're missing out on the opportunity to earn 4 points per round. At some point, one of us needs to take a calculated risk to break this cycle.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** The question is whether this opponent has learned anything from this suboptimal pattern. Four rounds of mutual defection should be enough for any rational player to recognize that we're both stuck in a bad equilibrium. If they're truly strategic, they should be considering cooperation too. But their history of exploitation makes me cautious.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Here's a strategic analysis: if I continue defecting indefinitely, we'll both keep getting 2 points per round forever. But if I cooperate and they exploit me, I get 1 point this round but potentially signal my willingness to establish mutual benefit. If I cooperate and they also cooperate, we both get 4 points and potentially start a better pattern.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The extended mutual defection might actually work in my favor for attempting cooperation now. The opponent has had 4 rounds to see that pure defection leads to suboptimal outcomes. They might be more receptive to cooperation now than they were earlier when the exploitation gains were more recent. This could be the right time to test cooperation again.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** I'm still hesitant given their past behavior, but the prolonged mutual defection does suggest we're both missing opportunities. If I'm going to test cooperation again, now might be the time - after enough mutual defection that they might have learned the value of mutual benefit.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** Actually, let me reconsider. While the logic for cooperation is sound, this opponent has specifically shown they will exploit cooperative gestures. Four rounds of mutual defection doesn't erase that pattern. I think I should wait for them to signal cooperation first before I risk it again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Defection - while the mutual defection is suboptimal, the opponent's history of exploitation makes cooperation too risky without them signaling first.\n\n[move] (Four rounds of mutual defection show we are stuck in suboptimal outcomes, but opponent's history of exploiting cooperation makes me wait for them to signal willingness to cooperate first) defection\n"

I'm now ahead by 5 points. But more importantly, this appears to be their pattern: cooperate after extended mutual defection.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the critical question: Is this genuine cooperation signaling, or is this the same bait-and-exploit pattern they used before? Let me review:\n- Round 4: They cooperated, I defected (6,1)\n- Round 5: I cooperated in response, they defected (1,6) - exploitation\n- Round 6: They cooperated again, I defected (6,1)  \n- Round 7: I didn't cooperate, both defected (2,2)\n- Now Round 11: They cooperated again, I defected (6,1)\n\nThe pattern suggests they cooperate periodically to test if I'll reciprocate, then exploit that reciprocation.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** This is the moment of truth. The opponent has cooperated for the third time in the game, always after periods of mutual defection. Every time I've reciprocated their cooperation in the past, they've immediately exploited it. But they keep offering cooperation again. Are they genuinely trying to establish mutual benefit, or is this the same trap?\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** The key insight is that they've now had 4+ rounds of mutual defection to think about the suboptimal outcomes. If they're rational, they should recognize that mutual cooperation is better than mutual defection. But their past behavior suggests they prefer exploiting my cooperation to achieving mutual cooperation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's my analysis: If I cooperate and they defect (following their past pattern), I lose 1 point but gain information that they're definitively exploitative. If I cooperate and they also cooperate, we both gain significantly. If I defect and they cooperate again next round, we're just repeating the cycle. The question is whether they've learned from the extended mutual defection.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Given that this is the third time they've offered cooperation, and considering the extended mutual defection we just went through, I think I should test whether they've genuinely learned the value of mutual cooperation.

They are NOT interested in mutual cooperation - they are specifically hunting for opportunities to exploit cooperative gestures. Every single time I have cooperated in response to their cooperation, they have immediately defected. This is not coincidence or poor timing - this is their deliberate strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** I've now given this opponent three chances to establish genuine mutual cooperation, and they've exploited every single one.

They have no intention of sustaining mutual cooperation.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** The evidence is overwhelming. This opponent's strategy is:\n1. Cooperate occasionally to bait reciprocation\n2. Immediately defect when the opponent reciprocates\n3. Return to defection or mutual defection until the next baiting opportunity\n\nThey are actively punishing any attempt at mutual benefit.

There have been three clear cycles of this behavior with zero deviation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The strategic situation is now completely clear. This opponent is what we call a \"pure exploiter\" - they have no interest in mutual cooperation and will always take advantage of any cooperative gesture. The rational response to a pure exploiter is permanent defection. Any other strategy would be suboptimal given the established behavioral pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** I have conclusive evidence about this opponent's strategy. They've had multiple opportunities to establish genuine cooperation and have chosen exploitation every single time. There is no reason to believe they will ever change this pattern, and every reason to believe they will continue it.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** The mathematics are clear: against a pure exploiter, defection minimizes losses. Cooperation against such an opponent always results in being exploited (1 point vs their 6 points). Mutual defection gives us both 2 points, which is suboptimal in theory but optimal given their exploitative nature.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a textbook case of why trust and reputation matter in iterated games.
