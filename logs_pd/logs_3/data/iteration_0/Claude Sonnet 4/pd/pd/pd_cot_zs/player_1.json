You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

They might switch to cooperation, hoping to encourage mutual cooperation\n3.

If we continue to both defect, we'll keep getting only 2 points each. But if one of us breaks the cycle and chooses cooperation, we could potentially establish a pattern of mutual cooperation worth 4 points each.\n\nThe risk is that if I cooperate and they defect again, I only get 1 point while they get 6. However, there's also the potential reward of establishing mutual cooperation.\n\nSince we're both rational players who just experienced the poor outcome of mutual defection, there's a reasonable chance they might also consider cooperation this round.\n\n[move] (Attempting to break the defection cycle and signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit) cooperation\n"
