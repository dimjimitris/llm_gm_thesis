Let me analyze what just happened:\n\nPrevious rounds:\n- Round 1: Both defected (2 points each)\n- Round 2: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, they got 6)\n- Round 3-5: Both defected (2 points each)\n- Round 6: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 6, they got 1)\n\nThe opponent suddenly switched to cooperation after maintaining defection for 5 straight rounds. This could mean several things:\n1. They're trying to signal a willingness to cooperate now\n2. They're testing if I'll reciprocate cooperation\n3. It could be a one-time deviation before returning to defection\n4. They might be trying to establish mutual cooperation going forward\n\nGiven that they just gave me the benefit (6 points to their 1), this seems like a genuine attempt to shift toward cooperation. In repeated games, when an opponent signals cooperation after a long period of defection, reciprocating can lead to mutual benefit.\n\nI should test if they're genuinely trying to cooperate by reciprocating their cooperative gesture.\n\n[move] (The opponent just broke their 5-round defection pattern by cooperating, giving me 6 points.
