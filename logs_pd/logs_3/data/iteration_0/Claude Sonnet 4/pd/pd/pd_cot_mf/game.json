Strategic certainty:\n   - Eleven consecutive defections represents statistical certainty of opponent strategy\n   - There is no reasonable doubt about their \"always defect\" approach\n   - They have proven immune to any cooperative signaling\n   - The behavioral pattern is completely predictable\n\n3. Optimal response confirmation:\n   - Against a confirmed \"always defect\" player, \"always defect\" is the mathematically optimal response\n   - This secures the maximum possible points (2 per round) given the opponent's fixed strategy\n   - Any cooperation attempt would result in a 1-point outcome with no upside potential\n\n4. Game equilibrium recognition:\n   - We've reached a stable Nash equilibrium of mutual defection\n   - Neither player has incentive to deviate given the other's proven strategy\n   - This represents the mathematically correct solution to this specific matchup\n\n5. Rational continuation:\n   - Eleven rounds of data eliminates any uncertainty about opponent behavior\n   - Defection maximizes my expected value and minimizes risk\n   - Any other choice would be irrational given the overwhelming evidence\n\n[move] (Eleven consecutive opponent defections confirm their fixed strategy, making defection the only rational choice) defection\n"
