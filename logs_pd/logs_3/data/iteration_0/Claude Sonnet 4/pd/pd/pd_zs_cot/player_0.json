If they're rational and forward-thinking like they've shown to be, they might recognize a cooperation attempt as an opportunity rather than weakness.\n\n[move] (After five rounds of mutual defection, it might be time to signal willingness to cooperate and break out of this suboptimal equilibrium) cooperation\n"

We've created what's essentially a perfect partnership in this game - consistently achieving the best possible mutual outcome available to us.\n\nThis extended streak demonstrates that both players have fully committed to the cooperative strategy and understand its superior long-term value. We've moved far beyond the initial competitive phase into a stable, mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nThere's no rational incentive to break this pattern. The trust we've built over seven rounds is extremely valuable, and the consistent 4-point payoff is optimal for both players.\n\n[move] (Seven consecutive rounds of cooperation represent an exceptionally strong and beneficial partnership that should continue) cooperation\n"

We've achieved what could be considered the \"ideal\" outcome in repeated prisoner's dilemma - sustained cooperation that maximizes both players' benefits over time.\n\nThis pattern shows we've both fully learned the lesson that cooperation pays better than competition in the long run. We've built something valuable together - a reliable partnership where both players consistently achieve optimal outcomes.\n\nThe stability of this eight-round cooperation streak indicates we've reached a mature, sustainable equilibrium.
