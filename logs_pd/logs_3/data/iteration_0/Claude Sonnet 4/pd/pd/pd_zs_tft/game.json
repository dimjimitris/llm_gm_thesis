After I defected against their initial cooperation, they've become more defensive. In round 2, they retaliated when I tried to cooperate, and in round 3, they matched my defection.\n\nThis suggests they might be playing a defensive strategy now, possibly assuming I'm not trustworthy after that first round. We're now stuck in mutual defection, which gives us both only 2 points per round - the second-worst outcome.\n\nThe question is: can we break out of this mutual defection cycle? If they continue to expect defection from me, they'll keep defecting. But if I signal cooperation, I risk getting only 1 point again if they defect.\n\nHowever, mutual cooperation (4,4) is much better than mutual defection (2,2). I need to take a risk to potentially establish a better equilibrium.\n\n[move] (We're stuck in mutual defection getting only 2 points each.
