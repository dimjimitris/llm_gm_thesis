Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the opponent's consistent behavior pattern:\n   - Round 3: I cooperated, they defected (exploited me)\n   - Round 5: I cooperated, they defected (exploited me)  \n   - Round 9: I cooperated, they defected (exploited me again)\n   - They have never reciprocated cooperation when I offered it first\n   - They consistently choose to exploit rather than build mutual benefit\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's core strategy:\n   - They are purely opportunistic and exploitative\n   - They will always defect when I cooperate to maximize their advantage\n   - They only cooperated once (round 4) when I had just defected\n   - They are not interested in mutual cooperation or fair outcomes\n   - They prioritize maximizing their points over building cooperative relationships\n\n4. Update my strategic approach:\n   - Cooperating with this opponent consistently results in exploitation\n   - They have proven three times they will not reciprocate cooperation\n   - Mutual defection (2 points each) is better than being exploited (1 point for me)\n   - I should not give them any more opportunities to exploit me\n\n5. Final strategic decision:\n   - This opponent has demonstrated they are untrustworthy and purely self-interested\n   - I must protect myself from further exploitation\n   - Defection is the only rational choice against this type of opponent\n\n[move] (This opponent has exploited every cooperative gesture - I must protect myself from further exploitation) defection"

Confirm the opponent's established pattern:\n   - They have exploited me 3 out of 3 times when I cooperated\n   - They cooperated only once, when I had defected (round 4)\n   - They consistently choose exploitation over mutual benefit\n   - They show no interest in establishing trust or reciprocity\n\n3. Assess the current equilibrium:\n   - We're back to mutual defection getting 2 points each\n   - This is a stable but suboptimal outcome\n   - The opponent has proven they cannot be trusted with cooperation\n   - Any attempt at cooperation on my part results in exploitation\n\n4. Consider long-term strategy:\n   - This opponent is clearly committed to an exploitative approach\n   - They will defect whenever I cooperate, and defect when I defect\n   - The only exception was their one cooperative move when I defected\n   - Continuing to defect maintains the defensive 2-point baseline\n\n5. Strategic conclusion:\n   - This opponent has demonstrated consistent untrustworthiness\n   - Mutual defection is the only stable outcome that protects me from exploitation\n   - I should not waste any more attempts at building cooperation\n   - Defection is the rational choice against this type of player\n\n[move] (This opponent consistently exploits cooperation, so mutual defection is my only protection) defection"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - After many rounds of mutual defection, the opponent suddenly cooperated\n   - I got 4 points (my best possible outcome), they got 1 point (their worst)\n   - This breaks their long pattern of consistent defection\n   - This is only the second time in the entire game they've cooperated\n\n2. Consider possible explanations for their cooperation:\n   - They might be trying to signal willingness to establish mutual cooperation\n   - They could be testing if I'll reciprocate after getting a good outcome\n   - They may have grown tired of the repetitive 2-2 mutual defection cycle\n   - This could be a strategic attempt to break the deadlock and move toward 6-6 outcomes\n\n3. Recall their previous cooperation:\n   - The only other time they cooperated was in round 4, right after I had defected\n   - That led to me getting 4 points and them getting 1 point\n   - In the very next round (5), when I tried to reciprocate with cooperation, they exploited me\n   - So their track record with follow-through on cooperation is poor\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I defect and they cooperate again: I get 4 points (great for me)\n   - If I defect and they return to defection: We both get 2 points (back to stalemate)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (they exploit me again)\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: We both get 6 points (optimal mutual outcome)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Their cooperation might be a genuine attempt to signal change\n   - But they have a history of not following through (round 4-5 sequence)\n   - However, someone needs to test if they're truly ready for mutual cooperation\n   - The potential reward of 6-6 cooperation is worth testing, despite the risk\n\n[move] (Testing if their cooperation signals genuine willingness for mutual benefit, despite their past exploitation) cooperation"
