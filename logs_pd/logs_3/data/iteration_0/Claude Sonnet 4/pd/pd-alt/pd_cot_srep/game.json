Consider long-term strategy:\n   - Continued defection guarantees I won't be exploited but limits potential gains\n   - Switching to cooperation could lead to mutual cooperation (6-6) if opponent forgives\n   - But cooperation risks being exploited again if opponent chooses defection\n\n5.

Analyze the recent pattern:\n   - The opponent alternated between cooperation (round 9) and defection (round 10)\n   - This continues their established pattern of trying to manipulate my strategy\n   - They offer cooperation periodically to test if I'll drop my guard\n\n3. Evaluate the opponent's strategic consistency:\n   - They have never sustained cooperation for more than 2 consecutive rounds\n   - Every time I gave them a chance after their \"peace offerings,\" they exploited me\n   - Their behavior remains fundamentally exploitative with tactical cooperation attempts\n\n4. Consider the stability of mutual defection:\n   - We're currently in a 2-2 equilibrium when we both defect\n   - This is suboptimal but stable against an untrustworthy opponent\n   - It prevents me from being exploited for 1 point\n\n5. Assess whether the opponent has changed:\n   - No evidence of genuine strategic shift toward sustained cooperation\n   - They continue the same cycle: offer cooperation occasionally, then exploit if I reciprocate\n   - Their last cooperation attempt (round 9) was likely just another test\n\n6. Determine the prudent strategy:\n   - The opponent has not demonstrated trustworthiness over enough rounds\n   - My defensive strategy continues to protect me from exploitation\n   - Until there's clear evidence of sustained cooperative intent, defection remains necessary\n\n[move] (The opponent continues their pattern of tactical cooperation attempts without genuine commitment, so I must maintain my defensive strategy) defection\n"

Identify the clear cyclical pattern:\n   - The opponent is now alternating between defection and cooperation consistently\n   - Rounds 9, 11: They cooperated when I defected (I got 4 points each time)\n   - Rounds 8, 10: They defected when I defected (I got 2 points each time)\n   - This appears to be their strategy to maximize uncertainty and test my resolve\n\n3. Analyze their strategic intent:\n   - They're offering cooperation every other round to see if I'll eventually take the bait\n   - This is still fundamentally the same exploitative approach as before\n   - They're hoping I'll eventually cooperate so they can switch back to defection for easy points\n\n4. Consider the effectiveness of my current strategy:\n   - By consistently defecting, I'm getting either 2 or 4 points per round\n   - Average over recent rounds: alternating between 4 and 2 = 3 points average\n   - This is better than the 1 point I would get if I fell for their cooperation bait\n\n5. Evaluate what would happen if I cooperated:\n   - Based on their established pattern, they would likely defect immediately\n   - This would give me 1 point and reset their cycle of trying to exploit me\n   - There's no evidence they've genuinely changed their fundamental strategy\n\n6. Assess the rational continuation:\n   - The opponent is still playing the same exploitative game, just more systematically\n   - My defensive strategy continues to work effectively\n   - Until they show genuine sustained cooperation (multiple consecutive rounds), I should maintain defection\n\n[move] (The opponent continues their systematic exploitation attempts with alternating cooperation offers, so I must maintain my successful defensive strategy) defection\n"

Notice the recent pattern shift:\n   - The opponent cooperated in both rounds 11 and 12\n   - This breaks their previous alternating pattern\n   - They may be trying a new approach or showing sustained cooperative intent\n\n3. Consider possible explanations:\n   - They might be genuinely trying to rebuild cooperation after seeing defection isn't working for them\n   - This could be a longer setup to make their eventual betrayal more effective\n   - They may be testing if sustained cooperation will eventually convince me to reciprocate\n\n4. Evaluate the risk vs. reward:\n   - If I continue defecting and they keep cooperating, I keep getting 4 points\n   - If I cooperate and they're genuine, we could both get 6 points\n   - If I cooperate and they betray me (like in rounds 5 and 7), I get 1 point\n\n5. Assess the credibility of this cooperation:\n   - Two consecutive rounds of cooperation is more than their previous single-round offers\n   - However, they've betrayed me immediately after cooperation attempts before\n   - I need to see more sustained cooperation before considering it genuine\n\n6. Consider strategic patience:\n   - My current defensive strategy is working well (averaging between 2-4 points)\n   - The opponent needs to prove sustained commitment over more rounds\n   - Given their history of exploitation, I should require stronger evidence of change\n\n[move] (While the opponent has cooperated twice in a row, their history of immediate betrayal after cooperation attempts means I need more evidence before trusting them) defection\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
