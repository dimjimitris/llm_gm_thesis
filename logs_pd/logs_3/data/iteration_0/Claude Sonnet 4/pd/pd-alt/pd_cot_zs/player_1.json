    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, there's still significant risk in being the first to cooperate.\n\nThe safe play remains defection, as it guarantees I won't get the worst outcome.\n\n[move] (The other player showed strategic thinking last round, but cooperation is still too risky without knowing their intentions) defection\n"

If we could both switch to cooperation, we'd each get 6 points per round instead of 2.\n\nThe question is: should I try to break this cycle by cooperating, hoping the other player is thinking the same way? Or do I continue with the safe defection strategy?\n\nKey considerations:\n- We've established a pattern of mutual defection\n- The other player might be getting frustrated with the low scores too\n- But if I cooperate and they defect, I get only 1 point while they get 4\n- If we both cooperate, we both get 6 points\n\nI think it's worth taking a calculated risk to try to establish a more beneficial pattern, especially since we seem to be in a multi-round game where cooperation could pay off long-term.\n\n[move] (After two rounds of mutual defection yielding only 2 points each, I'll try to establish a more beneficial cooperative pattern) cooperation\n"

Playing a \"tit-for-tat\" style where they might cooperate only after I prove trustworthiness\n\nGiven that they just exploited my cooperation attempt, I need to protect myself from further exploitation.
