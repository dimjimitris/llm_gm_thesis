A new player might:\n1. Choose cooperation as it seems \"nice\" or fair\n2. Choose defection to try to maximize their individual gain\n3. Make a random choice\n\nFrom a pure game theory perspective, defection dominates cooperation because:\n- If opponent cooperates: I get 4 (defect) vs 6 (cooperate) - Wait, that's wrong\n- If opponent cooperates: I get 4 (defect) vs 6 (cooperate) \n- If opponent defects: I get 2 (defect) vs 1 (cooperate)\n\nActually, let me reconsider. If the opponent cooperates, I'm better off cooperating (6 > 4). If the opponent defects, I'm better off defecting (2 > 1).\n\nSince this appears to be a one-shot game and I don't know the opponent's strategy, I should consider what maximizes my expected payoff.
