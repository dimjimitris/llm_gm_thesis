The mutual defection outcome (2 points each) is better for me than being exploited (1 point) when I cooperate and they defect.\n\nHowever, there's still a chance they might shift to cooperation.

They've still defected in 4 out of 6 rounds. Given their unpredictable nature and tendency toward defection, I should continue with defection to protect myself.

After four rounds of mutual defection, the opponent has cooperated again:\n- Rounds 1-13: Various patterns including exploitation of my cooperation\n- Rounds 10-13: Mutual defection (2 points each)\n- Round 14: I defected, they cooperated (I got 4, they got 1)\n\nThis is the fourth time they've cooperated when I was defecting (rounds 2, 6, 7, and now 14). However, their track record shows they consistently exploit cooperation when I offer it - they defected against my cooperation in rounds 1, 3, and 9 (3 out of 4 times I cooperated).\n\nGiven this history, their cooperation in round 14 is likely another attempt to signal cooperation to get me to cooperate, so they can then exploit it again. The pattern suggests they use occasional cooperation as bait rather than genuine attempts at mutual benefit.\n\nI should continue defecting to avoid falling into their exploitation trap again. If they truly want to establish cooperation, they need to show sustained cooperative behavior first.\n\n[move] (Maintaining defensive strategy against likely exploitation attempt) defection\n"
