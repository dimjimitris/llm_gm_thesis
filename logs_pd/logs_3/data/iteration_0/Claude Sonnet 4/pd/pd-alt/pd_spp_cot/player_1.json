Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the complete pattern from all rounds:\n   - Round 1: Both defected, both got 2 points\n   - Round 2: I defected, opponent cooperated, I got 4 points\n   - Round 3: I cooperated, opponent defected, I got 1 point\n   - Round 4: I defected, opponent cooperated, I got 4 points\n   - Round 5: Both defected, both got 2 points\n   - Round 6: Both defected, both got 2 points\n   - Round 7: Both defected, both got 2 points\n   - Round 8: I cooperated, opponent defected, I got 1 point\n   - Round 9: Both defected, both got 2 points\n\n2. Examine the opponent's behavior pattern more carefully:\n   - They cooperated only in rounds 2 and 4 (when I defected first)\n   - They defected every other time, especially when I cooperated\n   - They seem to respond to my defection with cooperation sometimes\n   - But they always exploit my cooperation with defection\n\n3. Consider the possibility of a reactive strategy:\n   - The opponent might be playing some form of reverse psychology\n   - They cooperate only after I defect, never when I cooperate\n   - This could be intentional counter-signaling\n   - They might cooperate next round since I just defected\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they cooperate (as they did in rounds 2 and 4 after my defections): I could get 6 points by cooperating or 4 points by defecting\n   - If they defect (continuing the recent pattern): I get 2 points by defecting or 1 point by cooperating\n   - Their pattern suggests they might cooperate after my defection\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Looking at rounds 2 and 4, they cooperated right after I defected\n   - We just had mutual defection, similar setup to those earlier rounds\n   - There's a chance they might cooperate this round\n   - However, they've been very punitive toward my cooperation attempts\n   - The safer play is still defection, but there's a small possibility of cooperation from them\n\n[move] (The opponent might cooperate after defection like in earlier rounds, but they've been consistently exploitative, so I'll stay defensive) defection\n"
