Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

No, 4 < 6, but I get 4 vs their 1)\n   - If I assume the opponent will defect, I should defect (2 > 1)\n   - Defection dominates cooperation from a pure self-interest perspective\n\n3. **Consider the opponent is \"fresh\" (new player):**\n   - A new player might be more likely to cooperate initially\n   - They may not immediately recognize the dominant strategy\n   - This could present an opportunity to exploit their cooperation\n\n4. **Evaluate my options:**\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 6 points (good outcome)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points (but less than mutual cooperation)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (worst for me)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (suboptimal)\n\n5. **Strategic decision:**\n   - Since this appears to be a single round and the opponent is fresh, I should choose the move that protects me from the worst outcome while potentially capitalizing on their inexperience\n   - Defection guarantees I won't get the worst payoff (1 point)\n\n[move] Defection - Playing it safe against an unknown opponent to avoid the worst-case scenario of getting only 1 point.\n"
