We both got 2 points instead of the typical 1-4 split that has occurred after our previous mutual cooperation rounds.\n\nThis could mean:\n1. My opponent anticipated that I would expect them to exploit me and adjusted their strategy\n2. They're shifting toward a more defensive approach\n3. They're testing whether I'll continue with defection or try cooperation again\n\nThe fact that they defected when they usually would have expected me to cooperate (and thus could have exploited me) suggests they might be evolving their strategy or trying to break the predictable cycle.\n\nNow we're back in mutual defection territory. Based on the historical pattern, periods of mutual defection eventually lead back to attempts at cooperation. Since we're both getting only 2 points per round in this state, there's incentive for one of us to try cooperation again.\n\n[move] (Continuing defection to see if opponent will make the first move toward cooperation) defection\n"
