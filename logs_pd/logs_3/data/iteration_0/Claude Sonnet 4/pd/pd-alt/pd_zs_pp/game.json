It seems like they occasionally break their alternating pattern, possibly when they get frustrated with consistently getting only 1 point when I defect.\n\nThe challenge is that mutual defection gives us both only 2 points each, which is less than ideal. However, based on their history, if I cooperate now, there's a high probability they'll defect and exploit me again (getting 4 while I get 1).\n\nBut there's also a pattern: after mutual defection, we've sometimes achieved mutual cooperation (like in rounds 11-12). Maybe they're more receptive to cooperation after we both get the low score of mutual defection.\n\nI'll test cooperation again, since the alternative is likely continued mutual defection at 2 points each.\n\n[move] (Testing cooperation after mutual defection to see if we can achieve mutual benefit again) cooperation\n"
