    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Defection provides more security with guaranteed minimum of 2 points.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the analysis, what's our final recommendation?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The math slightly favors cooperation if we believe they'll cooperate >58% of the time.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Fresh players typically start cooperative, so I estimate 65% cooperation probability.\n\n**Decision Strategist:** With 65% cooperation probability: Cooperation EV = 0.65\u00d76 + 0.35\u00d71 = 4.25 points. Defection EV = 0.65\u00d74 + 0.35\u00d72 = 3.3 points.

Let me consult with my personas again.\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent revealed their strategy - they defected against our cooperation, earning 4 points while we got only 1. This is significant information. They either:\n1. Always defect (pure defection strategy)\n2. Are testing us to see if we're exploitable\n3. Made a calculated first move but might change\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Being exploited in round 1 changes the psychological dynamic. The opponent now knows we started cooperatively, which could make them think we're either naive or playing a specific strategy like Tit-for-Tat. Their defection suggests they're either aggressive or strategic rather than purely cooperative.\n\n**Decision Strategist:** We have several strategic options for round 2:\n1. Tit-for-Tat: Defect to punish their defection\n2. Forgive: Cooperate again to signal we want mutual benefit\n3. Always defect: Assume they'll keep defecting and protect ourselves\n\nThe key question is whether this opponent will ever cooperate or if they're a pure defector.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they exploited our cooperation, what's the best response?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they're a pure defector, we should always defect to get 2 points instead of 1. If they might cooperate sometimes, Tit-for-Tat (defect now, then mirror their moves) could establish boundaries while leaving room for future cooperation.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Their defection against our cooperation suggests they prioritize individual gain over mutual benefit. This makes future cooperation less likely. However, some players defect first to test, then cooperate if the opponent retaliates.\n\n**Decision Strategist:** Tit-for-Tat is a proven strategy - it's nice (starts cooperative), retaliatory (punishes defection), forgiving (returns to cooperation), and clear (easy to understand). Since we already started nice, now we should retaliate.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So the consensus is to defect this round as retaliation?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Yes, defect to show we won't be repeatedly exploited.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Agreed, we need to signal that defection has consequences.\n\n**Decision Strategist:** Defect now, but be ready to cooperate again if they cooperate in future rounds.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Defect to establish that exploitation has consequences, following a Tit-for-Tat strategy.\n\n[move] (Retaliating for their defection to establish boundaries and show I won't be repeatedly exploited) defection\n"

The mutual defection in round 2 might have been their response to our retaliation, or they could be a consistent defector.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The pattern so far suggests they might be playing strategically rather than being a pure defector. They exploited our initial cooperation, then matched our defection. This could indicate they're:\n1. Playing Tit-for-Tat but started with defection\n2. Testing our responses\n3. Simply being defensive after our retaliation\n\n**Decision Strategist:** We're at a critical juncture. If we continue defecting, we lock into a (2,2) outcome indefinitely. If we try cooperation again, we risk another (1,4) exploitation. However, the only way to achieve the optimal (6,6) is if someone breaks the defection cycle.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What's the best move to potentially break this deadlock while minimizing risk?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Mathematically, if there's any chance they might cooperate (even 25%), attempting cooperation could be worth it since the upside (6 vs 2) is significant. But if they're likely to defect again, we should stick with defection.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Their behavior suggests they respond to our moves. Since we showed we can retaliate, they might now be more willing to cooperate if we signal peaceful intentions. Some players need to see strength before they'll consider cooperation.\n\n**Decision Strategist:** I recommend testing cooperation again. We've established we won't be repeatedly exploited (round 2 retaliation), so now we can probe for mutual benefit. If they defect again, we'll have strong evidence they're a pure defector and can adjust accordingly.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we take a calculated risk on cooperation to test for possible mutual benefit?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Yes, the information value alone justifies the risk.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Agreed, we've shown we can defend ourselves, now we can test for cooperation.\n\n**Decision Strategist:** Exactly - this distinguishes between strategic players and pure defectors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Cooperate to test if mutual benefit is possible after establishing that we won't be repeatedly exploited.\n\n[move] (Testing for mutual cooperation after showing I can retaliate when exploited) cooperation\n"

This is strong evidence they're either a pure defector or heavily favor defection regardless of our moves.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Their consistent defection pattern, even after we demonstrated we could retaliate, suggests they're not playing a reciprocal strategy like Tit-for-Tat. They appear to be either:\n1. A pure defector who always chooses defection\n2. Someone who believes defection is always optimal\n3. Testing how many times they can exploit us\n\nThe fact they defected again after our retaliation and second cooperation attempt is very telling.\n\n**Decision Strategist:** We now have sufficient data to conclude this opponent is highly unlikely to cooperate.

The confidence level is extremely high. Against a pure defector, always defecting is the unique optimal strategy, yielding 2 points vs 1 point for cooperation.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Seven rounds of identical behavior represents an established behavioral pattern with no variance whatsoever. This level of consistency indicates either:\n1. A fixed strategic commitment to defection\n2. An inability or unwillingness to consider cooperation\nEither way, expecting cooperation would be psychologically naive given the evidence.\n\n**Decision Strategist:** We are locked in the Nash equilibrium of mutual defection. This is the stable outcome given their pure defection strategy.
