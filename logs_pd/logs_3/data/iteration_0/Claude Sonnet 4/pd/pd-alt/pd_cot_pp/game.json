Identify the strategic situation:\n   - The opponent appears to be playing opportunistically\n   - They'll cooperate occasionally but will exploit sustained cooperation\n   - They've shown they can't be trusted to maintain mutual cooperation\n   - I need to protect myself from further exploitation\n\n4. Consider my options:\n   - If I continue cooperating, they'll likely continue exploiting (based on pattern)\n   - If I defect, they might return to their contrarian tendency and cooperate\n   - If I defect and they also defect, we both get 2 points (acceptable defensive outcome)\n   - Defecting protects me from the worst outcome while maintaining upside potential\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown they'll exploit cooperation when given the chance\n   - I should return to a more defensive strategy\n   - Defecting gives me better expected value given their opportunistic behavior\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll defect to protect against further exploitation, as the opponent has shown they cannot be trusted to maintain cooperative behavior.\n\n[move] (Returning to defensive play after being exploited when attempting sustained cooperation) defection\n"

Analyze the dominant pattern:\n   - The contrarian pattern has held in 7 out of 10 rounds\n   - Exceptions were: Round 5 (both defected), Round 7 (both defected), Round 8 (both cooperated)\n   - The opponent seems to default to contrarian behavior most of the time\n   - I'm now ahead again (29 vs 26 points)\n\n3. Evaluate the opponent's strategy:\n   - They appear to primarily use contrarian play as their base strategy\n   - They occasionally deviate, possibly to test or prevent total predictability\n   - When they do cooperate with my cooperation, they quickly return to exploitation\n   - The contrarian pattern gives them a way to score points while preventing me from sustained exploitation\n\n4. Consider strategic implications:\n   - If I continue defecting and they maintain contrarian behavior, I get 4 points\n   - If they deviate and also defect, we both get 2 points (still acceptable)\n   - Switching to cooperation would likely result in them defecting (I get 1 point)\n   - The contrarian pattern heavily favors me continuing to defect\n\n5. Optimal decision:\n   - Defecting has given me the best results against this opponent\n   - Their contrarian tendency makes defection highly profitable for me\n   - I should continue this approach as long as the pattern holds\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue defecting since the opponent's predominant contrarian strategy makes this the most profitable approach.\n\n[move] (Continuing to exploit the contrarian pattern that remains their dominant strategy) defection\n"

Identify the pattern of deviations:\n   - Contrarian pattern broken in rounds: 5, 7, 8, and 11\n   - All non-contrarian rounds happened when I defected multiple times in a row\n   - This suggests the opponent adapts when I repeatedly defect\n   - They seem to shift to defection to prevent continuous exploitation\n\n3. Analyze the opponent's adaptive behavior:\n   - After I defect 2+ times consecutively, they're more likely to also defect\n   - This reduces my gains from 4 points to 2 points\n   - They appear to be learning and countering my exploitation strategy\n   - I'm still ahead (31 vs 28) but the gap is narrowing\n\n4. Consider strategic options going forward:\n   - If I continue defecting, they may continue defecting (both get 2 points)\n   - If I switch to cooperation, they might return to contrarian mode and defect (I get 1)\n   - Or they might also cooperate if they're trying to reset to mutual cooperation (both get 6)\n   - The opponent seems to be getting more sophisticated in their responses\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - My repeated defection strategy is becoming less effective\n   - The opponent is adapting to prevent exploitation\n   - I might need to mix up my strategy or try to establish cooperation\n   - Given their adaptability, cooperation might catch them off guard and lead to mutual benefit\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to cooperation to see if I can break their defensive adaptation and potentially establish mutual cooperation for higher joint gains.\n\n[move] (Switching to cooperation to counter their defensive adaptation and test for mutual benefit) cooperation\n"

Analyze the pattern of mutual cooperation:\n   - We've achieved mutual cooperation twice: rounds 8 and 12\n   - Both times followed periods of mutual defection or exploitation\n   - The opponent seems willing to cooperate when the timing is right\n   - This suggests they might be open to establishing a cooperative pattern\n\n3. Consider the opponent's evolution:\n   - They started with pure contrarian strategy\n   - Evolved to defensive adaptation when I exploited repeatedly\n   - Now showing capacity for mutual cooperation\n   - They might be signaling readiness for a more cooperative approach\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - Mutual cooperation gives us both 6 points (the maximum possible)\n   - I'm currently ahead (37 vs 34) but not by much\n   - Previous attempts at sustained cooperation were exploited after one round\n   - But the opponent's behavior has become more sophisticated\n\n5. Risk-benefit analysis:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate again, we both get 6 points (excellent)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect, I get 1 point (they might exploit again)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate, I get 4 points (back to exploitation)\n   - The pattern suggests they might be ready for sustained cooperation now\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll cooperate again to test if we can finally establish a sustainable pattern of mutual cooperation, given their apparent evolution toward more sophisticated and cooperative play.\n\n[move] (Testing if we can establish sustained mutual cooperation given their evolved behavior) cooperation\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
