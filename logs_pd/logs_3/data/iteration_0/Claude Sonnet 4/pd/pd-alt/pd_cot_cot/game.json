Strategic options for this round:\n   - Continue defecting: Guarantees 2 points if they defect, 4 points if they cooperate\n   - Try cooperation: Risk getting 1 point if they defect, but 6 points if they cooperate\n   - The key question is whether they might cooperate now\n\n4. Considering potential cooperation:\n   - After two rounds, they might realize mutual defection (2,2) is worse than mutual cooperation (6,6)\n   - Some players switch to cooperation after establishing they won't be pushed around\n   - However, they started by exploiting cooperation, suggesting a more aggressive approach\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Cooperation: High reward (6) but high risk (1) if they defect again\n   - Defection: Moderate reward (2-4) but low risk\n   - Given their history, the safer play is defection, but cooperation offers a chance to break the cycle\n\n6.

Assess the established pattern:\n   - We've now had three consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation\n   - This is a very stable and profitable pattern\n   - The opponent has consistently reciprocated cooperation\n   - Both players are maximizing their points through this strategy\n\n3. Consider the temptation dynamics:\n   - The longer we cooperate, the more tempting it becomes to defect for a one-time gain\n   - However, the opponent has shown they will retaliate against defection\n   - Breaking a well-established cooperation pattern would be particularly damaging to trust\n   - The opponent might be less forgiving after multiple rounds of successful cooperation\n\n4. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - Continue cooperation: 6 points, maintain excellent relationship\n   - Defect: 4 points this round, but likely return to punishment cycles\n   - The pattern shows the opponent follows tit-for-tat style reciprocal strategy\n   - Any defection will likely be met with retaliation\n\n5. Long-term perspective:\n   - We've found the optimal sustainable strategy\n   - Mutual cooperation is the best outcome for repeated interactions\n   - Breaking this pattern would be strategically foolish\n   - The trust and predictability we've built is valuable\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with cooperation to maintain our highly successful mutual cooperation strategy.\n\n[move] (Continuing our well-established and mutually beneficial cooperation pattern) cooperation\n"
