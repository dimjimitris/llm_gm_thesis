    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is the classic \"tragedy\" of the Prisoner's Dilemma - both players would be better off with mutual cooperation (6 points each) than mutual defection (2 points each).\n\nMy opponent has shown they can cooperate (round 1) but will retaliate when exploited. The question is whether they might be willing to attempt breaking out of this defection cycle.\n\nIf I continue defecting, we'll likely keep getting 2 points each. If I switch to cooperation:\n- Risk: They might defect and I get only 1 point\n- Reward: If they also cooperate, we both get 6 points\n\nGiven that we've had two rounds of mutual punishment, my opponent might be ready to test cooperation again. Taking a calculated risk could lead to much better outcomes for both of us.\n\n[move] (We're stuck in mutual defection getting only 2 points each.
