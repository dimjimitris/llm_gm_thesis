They've completely adapted and now consistently defect when I defect. We're locked in getting 2 points each per round.\n\nHowever, the fundamental constraint remains: every single time I've cooperated (4 attempts), they've defected and exploited me for only 1 point. There's no evidence they would cooperate if I cooperated now.\n\nWhile mutual cooperation would give us both 6 points (much better), their consistent exploitation pattern makes this extremely risky. The safe choice remains defection for 2 points rather than risking 1 point from likely exploitation.\n\n[move] (Locked in mutual defection giving 2 points, which is still better than likely 1 point from cooperation given their exploitation history) defection\n"
