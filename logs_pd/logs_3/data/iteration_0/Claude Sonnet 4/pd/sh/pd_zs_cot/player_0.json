This represents an extraordinarily well-established cooperative partnership:\n\n- Round 1: Both stag (6 each) - initial cooperation\n- Round 2: I stag, opponent hare (1 for me, 4 for opponent) - opponent's single test defection\n- Round 3: Both hare (2 each) - mutual defensive response\n- Rounds 4-14: Both stag (6 each) - sustained optimal cooperation\n\nEleven straight rounds of mutual cooperation is a testament to the strength and reliability of our strategic partnership. We've created what economists call a \"self-enforcing agreement\" where both parties have powerful incentives to maintain the cooperative behavior that benefits us both maximally.\n\nThe pattern is crystal clear: after working through an initial testing phase, we've settled into a highly predictable, mutually beneficial equilibrium that consistently delivers optimal results.\n\nThere's no compelling reason to deviate from a strategy that has proven so successful over such an extended period.\n\n[move] (Continuing the remarkably successful cooperative strategy that has consistently maximized mutual benefits) stag\n"
