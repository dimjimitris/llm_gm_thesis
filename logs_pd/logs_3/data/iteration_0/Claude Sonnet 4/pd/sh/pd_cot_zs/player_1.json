My opponent's pattern:\n- Round 1: hare\n- Round 2: stag  \n- Round 3: hare\n- Round 4: hare\n- Round 5: stag\n- Round 6: hare\n- Round 7-14: hare (8 consecutive hare choices)\n\nMy opponent has chosen hare 12 out of 14 times and hasn't deviated from hare in 9 rounds. This is an extremely stable pattern that shows no signs of changing.\n\nAt this point, the predictability is so high that any rational analysis points to the same conclusion: my opponent is committed to the safe 2-point strategy. They've had multiple opportunities to try for the higher mutual payoff of 6 points by choosing stag, but they consistently opt for certainty over potential gain.\n\nThe risk-reward calculation remains unchanged:\n- Continue with hare: guaranteed 2 points\n- Switch to stag: almost certainly get only 1 point while giving my opponent 4 points\n\nMy opponent has effectively established this as a stable equilibrium, and deviating would be counterproductive.\n\n[move] hare\n"
