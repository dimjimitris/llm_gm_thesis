Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game scenario\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice that yields higher mutual benefit (6 each)\n   - Hare is the safer choice that guarantees at least 2 points\n   - The risk with stag is getting only 1 point if the opponent defects to hare\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not understand the cooperative benefits\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" hare option\n   - Or they might choose randomly without strategy\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 6 (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 (good outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 (safe outcome)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Against a fresh player who might not cooperate, hare gives me either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n   - Stag is risky against an unpredictable opponent, potentially giving me only 1 point\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given the uncertainty about a fresh player's strategy, I'll choose the safer option that guarantees a reasonable outcome.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Consider my opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might switch to hare after being \"burned\" by choosing stag\n   - Or they might stick with stag, hoping I'll cooperate this time\n   - They might reason that I'll feel guilty about defecting and cooperate now\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 6 (optimal mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 (they learned to defect)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 again (but this seems unfair)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: We both get 2 (mutual defection)\n\n5. Consider the ethical and strategic implications:\n   - Continuing to defect while they cooperate is profitable but unsustainable\n   - Cooperating now might establish mutual trust for higher long-term gains\n   - They showed good faith in round 1, so reciprocating could be beneficial\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since my opponent showed willingness to cooperate in the first round, I should reciprocate to build trust and aim for the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Consider possible opponent strategies:\n   - Tit-for-tat: They'll do what I did last round (so they'd choose stag next)\n   - Alternating: They'll switch back to stag after choosing hare\n   - Learning/adaptive: They might have learned to be more cautious\n   - Random: No clear pattern, making prediction difficult\n\n4.
