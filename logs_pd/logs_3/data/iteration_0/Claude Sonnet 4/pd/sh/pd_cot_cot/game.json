First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. Let me analyze the strategic implications:\n   - If I expect the opponent to choose stag, my best response is stag (6 > 4)\n   - If I expect the opponent to choose hare, my best response is hare (2 > 1)\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), I need to consider their likely behavior:\n   - Fresh players might be cautious and choose the safer option\n   - Hare is the safer choice because it guarantees at least 2 points regardless of opponent's move\n   - Stag is riskier but offers the highest mutual payoff\n\n4. However, I should also consider that a fresh player might not fully grasp the strategic complexity and could choose randomly or go for the highest possible individual payoff.\n\n5. Given the uncertainty about the opponent's strategy, I need to balance risk and reward. The safest approach would be hare, but if I can coordinate on stag, we both get the best outcome.\n\n6. Since this is the first interaction with a fresh player, I'll choose the cooperative strategy (stag) to test if they're willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Review the previous round:\n   - I chose stag, opponent chose hare\n   - I got 1 point, opponent got 4 points\n   - This confirms the opponent took the safer/more selfish option\n\n2. Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose hare when I chose stag, suggesting they either:\n     * Are risk-averse and prefer the guaranteed minimum\n     * Are being strategic and exploiting cooperative moves\n     * Don't trust me to cooperate\n\n3. Consider my options for this round:\n   - If I choose stag again and they choose hare again: I get 1, they get 4\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4, they get 1\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2, they get 2\n   - If we both choose stag: I get 6, they get 6\n\n4. Since the opponent showed they're willing to choose hare (either for safety or to exploit), I should adapt my strategy:\n   - Choosing stag again is risky - if they stick with hare, I get only 1 point again\n   - Choosing hare protects me from getting the worst outcome and could give me 4 points if they switch to stag\n\n5. Given that the opponent already demonstrated they'll choose hare, and fresh players often stick with what worked before, I should switch to hare to either:\n   - Get 2 points if they stick with hare\n   - Get 4 points if they switch to stag\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - They switched from hare to stag after seeing my initial cooperative move\n   - This suggests they might be using a \"tit-for-tat\" or reactive strategy\n   - They may have realized that always choosing hare isn't optimal if I adapt\n\n3. Consider what the opponent might be thinking now:\n   - They saw me switch to hare after their hare choice\n   - They might expect me to continue with hare, so they chose stag to get 4 points\n   - Or they might be trying to establish cooperation by choosing stag\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they're trying to cooperate (choose stag), I should choose stag for mutual benefit (6,6)\n   - If they're being reactive and will choose hare next (expecting me to choose stag), I should choose hare\n   - If they stick with stag, choosing stag gives us both maximum points\n\n5. The fact that they switched to stag after I got 4 points suggests they might be willing to cooperate or at least try different strategies. Since we're now tied in points, this could be a good opportunity to establish mutual cooperation.\n\n6.

Analyze the established pattern:\n   - We've now had three consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation\n   - Each mutual cooperation round gives us both the maximum possible points (6)\n   - My opponent has consistently chosen stag when I choose stag\n   - We've moved past the initial tit-for-tat phase into stable cooperation\n\n3. Consider the strength of this cooperative equilibrium:\n   - Three rounds of consistent mutual cooperation is a strong signal\n   - Both players are benefiting maximally from this strategy\n   - Any deviation would reduce total welfare and likely trigger retaliation\n   - The pattern has become predictable and mutually beneficial\n\n4. Evaluate potential temptations and risks:\n   - Defecting now would give me 4 points instead of 6 (actually worse!)\n   - It would also break the trust and likely restart conflict\n   - The opponent has shown they will retaliate against defection\n   - Continued cooperation guarantees the best possible outcome\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - We've found the Nash equilibrium for repeated play\n   - Both players are maximizing their scores through cooperation\n   - There's no rational incentive to deviate from this pattern\n   - This is the optimal long-term strategy\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: We have established a highly successful cooperative pattern that maximizes both our scores. There is no strategic reason to deviate from this winning formula.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
