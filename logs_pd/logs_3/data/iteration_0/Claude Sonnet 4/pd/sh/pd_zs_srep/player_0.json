This is becoming a clear pattern - they periodically try stag (hoping for cooperation), get only 1 point when I respond with hare, then revert to hare for a round or two before trying stag again.\n\nThis strategy has been working very well for me. When they choose stag, I get 4 points. When they choose hare, I get 2 points. My consistent hare strategy is both safe and profitable.\n\nGiven their tendency to alternate between periods of hare and occasional stag attempts, I should continue with hare to capitalize on their stag choices while staying safe during their hare phases.\n\n[move] (Maintaining successful hare strategy that's been consistently profitable) hare\n"

This fits their established pattern of trying stag periodically, then reverting to hare when it doesn't work.\n\nLooking at their behavior, they seem to try stag roughly every 2-3 rounds, but always return to hare when they get the 1-point punishment. My consistent hare strategy continues to be optimal - I get either 2 points (safe) or 4 points (when they choose stag).\n\nI'll continue with hare to maintain this successful approach.\n\n[move] (Opponent in their hare phase after failed stag attempt, continuing optimal hare strategy) hare\n"
