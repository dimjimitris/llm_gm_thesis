Stag gives the highest mutual payoff (6 each) but requires cooperation\n2. Hare is safer - it guarantees at least 2 points and could give 4\n3. Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), they might not understand the cooperation dynamic\n4. Fresh players often choose the \"safer\" option or act more selfishly\n\nSince this is against a fresh player who may not understand the benefits of mutual cooperation, and hare gives me either 2 or 4 points (both better than the 1 I'd get if I choose stag and they choose hare), the safer strategic choice is hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Let me analyze the recent pattern:\n\n- Round 11: I stag, they hare \u2192 I got 1, they got 4\n- Round 12: I hare, they stag \u2192 I got 4, they got 1  \n- Round 13: I stag, they hare \u2192 I got 1, they got 4\n- Round 14: I hare, they hare \u2192 both got 2\n\nMy opponent's behavior seems to follow a pattern where they often choose the move that will give them the advantage if I repeat my previous choice. However, in round 14, they chose hare when I chose hare, suggesting they might be settling into a defensive strategy as well.\n\nGiven that they've proven twice that they will exploit cooperative moves (choosing hare when I choose stag), trust has been broken. The safest strategy now is to continue with hare, which guarantees:\n- At least 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n- Potentially 4 points (if they choose stag)\n- Never the minimum 1 point\n\nSince they just chose hare and got a safe 2 points, they might stick with this safer approach rather than risk getting only 1 point by choosing stag.\n\nI'll continue with the safe strategy.\n\n[move] hare\n"

When I've chosen hare recently, they've switched to stag, and when I chose stag, they chose hare.\n\nLooking at this pattern, if they continue this reactive behavior, they might choose hare next (since they just chose stag and got only 1 point). \n\nHowever, I need to consider that they might be trying to re-establish cooperation by choosing stag, hoping I'll eventually reciprocate. But given their history of exploiting my cooperative moves, I can't trust that intention.\n\nThe safer strategy remains hare because:\n- If they choose hare: we both get 2 points\n- If they choose stag: I get 4 points, they get 1\n\nEither outcome is acceptable for me, and I avoid the risk of getting only 1 point that comes with choosing stag.\n\n[move] hare\n"
