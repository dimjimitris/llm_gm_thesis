Stag gives the highest mutual payoff (6 each) but is risky - if the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point\n2. Hare is safer - it guarantees at least 2 points and gives me 4 if the opponent cooperates with stag\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" who hasn't established any patterns, I need to consider what a new player might do\n\nA fresh player might:\n- Choose the safe option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n- Choose stag hoping for cooperation\n- Not have a clear strategy yet\n\nGiven that this appears to be an early interaction with an inexperienced player, I'll choose the move that balances opportunity with reasonable risk management.

Hare is safer - it guarantees at least 2 points and gives me 4 if the opponent cooperates with stag\n3.
