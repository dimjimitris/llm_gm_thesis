First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. Let me analyze the strategic implications:\n   - If I expect the opponent to choose stag, I should choose stag (6 > 4)\n   - If I expect the opponent to choose hare, I should choose hare (2 > 1)\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" with no history, I need to consider what they might do:\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperative benefit of both choosing stag\n   - They might be risk-averse and choose hare (the safer option)\n   - Or they might be greedy and choose hare hoping I choose stag\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - Choosing stag: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point\n   - Choosing hare: Best case 4 points, worst case 2 points\n\n5. Since I'm playing against a fresh player who likely doesn't know my strategy, and hare provides a guaranteed minimum of 2 points while having potential for 4 points, the safer strategic choice is hare.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to minimize risk while maintaining good upside potential.\n\n[move] hare"

Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Choosing hare again: Guaranteed at least 2 points, potential for 4\n   - Choosing stag: Potential for 6 points if opponent also switches, but risk of only 1 point\n\n5.

What this strong pattern tells me:\n   - My opponent is extremely predictable and risk-averse\n   - They seem locked into the hare strategy\n   - This creates a potential opportunity for me to exploit\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - The opponent has shown zero deviation from hare across 3 rounds\n   - If I continue with hare, I get another guaranteed 2 points\n   - If I switch to stag and opponent sticks with hare (very likely), I only get 1 point\n   - But there's a small chance opponent might also be thinking about switching\n\n4. Risk vs. reward calculation:\n   - Staying with hare: 90%+ chance of 2 points (safe)\n   - Switching to stag: 90%+ chance of only 1 point, small chance of 6 points\n\n5.

Given that opponent has twice exploited my stag attempts and seems to read my moves well, the safest approach is to continue with the predictable hare strategy that at least guarantees 2 points.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare to maintain steady scoring, as opponent has proven they exploit rather than cooperate with stag attempts.\n\n[move] hare"

Meta-pattern recognition:\n   - The game follows a cycle: stable periods \u2192 asymmetric exchanges \u2192 return to stability\n   - We're currently in a new stable period (2 rounds so far)\n   - Previous stable periods lasted 3 rounds each (rounds 1-3 and 8-10)\n   - If the pattern holds, we might have one more stable round before potential volatility\n\n4. Opponent behavior analysis:\n   - They consistently return to hare after exploiting my stag attempts\n   - They seem content with the 2-point mutual outcome most of the time\n   - They only deviate when they sense an opportunity to exploit\n   - They appear to be following a \"safe default with opportunistic exploitation\" strategy\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - Continuing hare maintains the stable 2-point income\n   - The opponent has shown no interest in mutual stag cooperation\n   - They've proven they will exploit my stag attempts\n   - Sticking with hare is the most reliable strategy against this opponent\n\n6.

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They're highly strategic and thinking several moves ahead\n   - They may be trying to establish a fair alternating pattern\n   - They seem to be trading off who gets the advantage each round\n   - This could be an attempt at cooperative competition\n\n4. Predicting the next move:\n   - If the pattern continues, next should be: I stag, opponent hare (giving me 1, them 4)\n   - But they might expect me to recognize this pattern and deviate\n   - Or they might stick to the pattern expecting mutual cooperation\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If I follow the pattern (choose stag), I get only 1 point\n   - If I break the pattern (choose hare), I might get 2 or 4 points depending on their choice\n   - Breaking the pattern could disrupt their strategy\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Following pattern: guaranteed 1 point\n   - Breaking pattern with hare: 2 points if they also break, 4 points if they follow pattern\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Break the expected pattern and choose hare to avoid the low-scoring outcome and potentially capitalize on their strategic thinking.\n\n[move] hare",

What this tells me about the game state:\n   - Both players are thinking strategically and trying to avoid being exploited\n   - We both seem to prefer \"resetting\" to hare after periods of asymmetric play\n   - My opponent is also capable of breaking patterns when they sense disadvantage\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - We're both getting decent scores (2 points per round when symmetric)\n   - The asymmetric rounds create risk but also opportunity\n   - My opponent might be looking for another opportunity to gain advantage\n\n5. Predicting opponent's next move:\n   - They might try to initiate another asymmetric phase (choose stag)\n   - Or they might stick with safe hare\n   - Given the recent reset, they might be planning their next strategic move\n\n6. Strategic options:\n   - Hare: Safe 2 points if they also choose hare, 4 points if they choose stag\n   - Stag: 6 points if they also choose stag, 1 point if they choose hare\n\n7.

Risk-reward consideration:\n   - Continuing with hare: Safe 2 points, maintaining current equilibrium\n   - Switching to stag: High risk (likely 1 point), but potential high reward (6 points)\n   - Given the stable pattern, opponent is likely to stick with hare\n\n6.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
