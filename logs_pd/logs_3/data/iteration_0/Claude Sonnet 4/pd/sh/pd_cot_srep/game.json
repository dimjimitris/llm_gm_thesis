Identify the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points (mutual cooperation)\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points (mutual defection)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, other gets 4\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4, other gets 1\n\n2. Analyze the strategic implications:\n   - This is a \"Stag Hunt\" game where mutual cooperation (stag-stag) gives the highest joint payoff\n   - However, hare is the \"safer\" choice - it guarantees at least 2 points regardless of opponent's move\n   - Stag is riskier but offers higher reward if both cooperate\n\n3. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player might not have developed trust or cooperation patterns yet\n   - They might choose the safer option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Or they might try to cooperate (stag) hoping for mutual benefit\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 6 points (best case)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (worst case for me)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Since this is the first interaction with a fresh player, I'll take a moderate risk and choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for the highest mutual payoff\n   - This establishes a cooperative tone that could benefit future rounds\n\n[move] stag\n"

Evaluate the temptation vs. long-term strategy:\n   - There's a temptation to exploit their apparent trust by switching to hare\n   - However, this could break the cooperative pattern and lead to worse outcomes in future rounds\n   - The consistent 6-point outcomes are very good and sustainable\n\n5.

Consider the game theory implications:\n   - The opponent just demonstrated willingness to risk cooperation\n   - This might be an opportunity to establish a new cooperative phase\n   - However, I need to be cautious about their past exploitative behavior\n   - The fact that we're now tied changes the strategic landscape\n\n7. Assess the trust situation:\n   - They made a cooperative gesture that I didn't reciprocate\n   - If I choose stag now, it shows I'm willing to cooperate when the stakes are balanced\n   - This could be the foundation for rebuilding mutual cooperation\n\n8. Make strategic decision:\n   - Now that we're tied, the risk/reward calculation has changed\n   - I'll choose stag to signal that I'm willing to cooperate and potentially restore the mutually beneficial 6-6 outcomes\n   - This reciprocates their cooperative gesture and could restart the cooperation cycle\n\n[move] stag\n"

Analyze what just happened in Round 11:\n   - Both chose stag (mutual cooperation)\n   - Both got 6 points (optimal outcome for both)\n   - This is the first mutual cooperation since Round 2\n\n2. Review the strategic progression:\n   - Round 10: I hare, they stag \u2192 I got 4, they got 1 (I capitalized on their cooperative gesture)\n   - Round 11: Both stag \u2192 Both got 6 (mutual cooperation restored)\n   - Current totals: Me 36, Opponent 36 (perfectly tied)\n\n3. Interpret the successful cooperation:\n   - The opponent attempted cooperation in Round 10 despite getting punished\n   - I reciprocated in Round 11, and they maintained their cooperative stance\n   - We've successfully broken out of the defensive stalemate\n   - Both players now have equal stakes in the game\n\n4. Assess the current strategic landscape:\n   - We're perfectly tied, removing any advantage-based incentives\n   - We've demonstrated that mutual cooperation is possible again\n   - The 6-6 outcome is clearly superior to the 2-2 stalemate we were in\n   - Both players have shown willingness to cooperate when the situation is balanced\n\n5. Consider the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They took the initiative to break the stalemate and it worked\n   - They experienced the reward of mutual cooperation (6 points)\n   - They're likely to want to continue this successful pattern\n   - The equal standing creates fair conditions for continued cooperation\n\n6. Evaluate the trust situation:\n   - We've re-established a cooperative dynamic after a long defensive period\n   - The successful Round 11 cooperation builds positive momentum\n   - Both players have demonstrated good faith in the recent exchanges\n\n7. Consider the strategic options:\n   - Choose stag: Continue the cooperative momentum, aiming for another 6-6 outcome\n   - Choose hare: Break the trust and exploit their likely cooperation, but risk returning to defensive stalemate\n\n8. Apply game theory principles:\n   - When mutual cooperation has been re-established and is working well, maintaining it is usually optimal\n   - The equal game state creates ideal conditions for sustained cooperation\n   - Breaking trust now would likely lead back to the suboptimal defensive pattern\n\n9. Make strategic decision:\n   - I'll choose stag to maintain the restored cooperative relationship\n   - This continues the mutually beneficial pattern and keeps us both at optimal scoring\n\n[move] stag\n"

Analyze the current positive trend:\n   - Round 11: Both stag \u2192 Both got 6 points\n   - Round 12: Both stag \u2192 Both got 6 points  \n   - We've now had two consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation\n   - Current totals: Me 42, Opponent 42 (still perfectly tied)\n\n2. Review the complete game arc:\n   - Started with cooperation (Rounds 1-2)\n   - Went through exploitation and retaliation (Rounds 3-5)\n   - Had extended defensive stalemate (Rounds 6-9)\n   - Opponent broke stalemate, I capitalized, then we restored cooperation (Rounds 10-12)\n   - We're back to the optimal mutual cooperation pattern\n\n3. Assess the stability of current cooperation:\n   - Both players have experienced the benefits of the 6-6 outcomes again\n   - The perfect tie eliminates any competitive pressure to exploit\n   - We've successfully moved past the earlier trust issues\n   - The pattern appears to be stabilizing positively\n\n4. Consider the opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They've seen that cooperation works when both commit to it\n   - The equal standing makes continued cooperation appealing\n   - They initiated the return to cooperation and have been rewarded for it\n   - They're likely to want to maintain this successful pattern\n\n5. Evaluate potential risks:\n   - There's always temptation to exploit when the other player is cooperating\n   - However, we've both experienced the negative consequences of exploitation cycles\n   - The current equal state makes exploitation less attractive than when someone was ahead\n\n6. Consider long-term strategy:\n   - Sustained mutual cooperation gives us both 6 points per round\n   - This is clearly superior to any other stable pattern we could establish\n   - Breaking cooperation would likely lead back to defensive cycles with lower payoffs\n\n7. Apply strategic reasoning:\n   - The cooperative momentum is strong and mutually beneficial\n   - Both players have demonstrated commitment to this pattern\n   - The equal game state creates ideal conditions for sustained cooperation\n   - There's no strategic advantage to breaking this successful pattern\n\n8.

Review the cooperative momentum:\n   - We've now matched our initial cooperation streak (Rounds 1-2 were also mutual stag)\n   - Both players have consistently chosen cooperation for three rounds straight\n   - The 6-6 outcomes are clearly working well for both parties\n   - No signs of either player wanting to break this pattern\n\n3. Assess the strategic stability:\n   - The perfect tie eliminates competitive incentives to exploit\n   - Both players are earning maximum possible points per round\n   - We've learned from the earlier cycles of exploitation and retaliation\n   - The current pattern is sustainable and mutually beneficial\n\n4. Consider the psychological factors:\n   - Both players have experienced the superior outcomes of cooperation\n   - The trust has been rebuilt after the earlier breakdown\n   - There's positive momentum and expectation of continued cooperation\n   - Breaking this pattern would be surprising and potentially costly\n\n5. Evaluate the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They initiated the return to cooperation and have been consistently rewarded\n   - Three rounds of 6 points each reinforces the value of this strategy\n   - They have no reason to deviate from a working cooperative approach\n   - The equal standing makes exploitation less tempting\n\n6. Consider potential risks and rewards:\n   - Risk of switching to hare: Likely to restart defensive cycles, return to suboptimal outcomes\n   - Reward of continuing stag: Maintains optimal scoring and positive relationship\n   - The established pattern creates strong expectations for continued cooperation\n\n7. Apply game theory principles:\n   - When a cooperative equilibrium is working well and both players are benefiting equally, maintaining it is optimal\n   - The repeated success reinforces the strategy for both players\n   - Deviation would be irrational given the current positive outcomes\n\n8.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s).

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
