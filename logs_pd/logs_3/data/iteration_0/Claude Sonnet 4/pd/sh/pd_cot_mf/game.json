Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - Stag is a cooperative move that yields high mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - Hare is a defection move that can exploit stag (4 points vs 1)\n   - If both defect with hare, we both get low payoff (2 points each)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not immediately see the cooperative opportunity\n   - They might play defensively or randomly\n   - They might choose hare to avoid being exploited\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (worst for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (good for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (safe but low)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   Since this is against a fresh player who might not recognize the cooperative potential, and since being exploited (stag vs hare) gives me only 1 point while exploiting them gives me 4 points, the safer play is hare. This protects me from the worst outcome and gives me a chance at a good outcome.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what happened:\n   - I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I got 4 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This confirms the opponent was willing to cooperate (chose stag)\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They're willing to trust and cooperate initially\n   - They likely expected mutual cooperation but got exploited\n   - They probably feel betrayed and may adjust their strategy\n\n3. Predict opponent's likely response:\n   - After being exploited, they may switch to hare to protect themselves\n   - They might still try stag if they believe in long-term cooperation\n   - They could retaliate by choosing hare\n\n4. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points each (rebuilding trust)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (they retaliate)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points again (double exploitation)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points each (mutual defection)\n\n5. Strategic consideration:\n   Since I exploited them last round, they're likely to be more defensive now. If they switch to hare (which is rational after being exploited), then choosing hare myself gives us both 2 points. If they're still willing to cooperate with stag, I could exploit again for 4 points. However, continuing to exploit might lead to permanent mutual defection.\n\n   The safer play is still hare, as it protects against retaliation while maintaining the possibility of a decent outcome.\n\n[move] hare\n"

What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They started cooperatively (stag in round 1)\n   - After being exploited, they switched to defensive play (hare in round 2)\n   - They're now in a defensive mindset, likely expecting me to defect again\n\n3. Consider the current situation:\n   - We're both stuck in mutual defection (hare-hare) giving us 2 points each\n   - This is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (stag-stag) which gives 6 points each\n   - Someone needs to take a risk to break out of this low-payoff cycle\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points each (much better outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (risk of exploitation)\n   - If I choose hare and they continue hare: 2 points (staying in low cycle)\n   - If I choose hare and they switch to stag: 4 points (exploiting again)\n\n5. Long-term strategic thinking:\n   - Continuing with hare keeps us both at 2 points per round\n   - Switching to stag signals willingness to cooperate and could lead to the optimal 6-6 outcome\n   - Even if they exploit me once (giving me 1 point), if it leads to future cooperation, the long-term payoff is better\n   - Taking a cooperative risk might rebuild trust\n\nSince we're stuck in a suboptimal cycle, I should signal cooperation to try to achieve the better mutual outcome.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
