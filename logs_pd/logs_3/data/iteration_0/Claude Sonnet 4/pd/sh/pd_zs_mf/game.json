They might assume I'll continue with this safe strategy.\n\nBut there's another consideration: if they're thinking the same way I am, they might also be getting tired of the low payoffs and considering a switch to stag, hoping I'll do the same for mutual benefit.\n\nThis creates an interesting dilemma. The safe choice is hare for another guaranteed 2 points.
