Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what the other player might do:\n   - If they choose stag, my best response is stag (6 points vs 4 points)\n   - If they choose hare, my best response is hare (2 points vs 1 point)\n\n3. Since this is a \"fresh player\" (meaning they're new), they might not understand the strategic complexity. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose safer options when uncertain\n   - Might not trust that I'll cooperate\n   - May choose hare as it guarantees at least 2 points and could give them 4\n\n4. However, if we both choose stag, we both get the maximum mutual benefit (6 points each). This requires trust and coordination.\n\n5. Given that this is against a fresh player who may be risk-averse and untrusting, I should consider that they're more likely to choose hare for safety.\n\n6. If I expect them to choose hare, then hare is my best response (2 points vs 1 point).\n\nFinal decision: Since I'm playing against a fresh player who is likely to choose the safer hare option, I should also choose hare to avoid the worst outcome.\n\n[move] hare\n"

In the previous round, both the other player and I chose hare, resulting in 2 points each.\n\n2. This tells me something about the other player:\n   - They also chose the \"safe\" option of hare\n   - This confirms they might be risk-averse or cautious\n   - However, they now know that I also chose hare\n\n3. Now I need to think about what they might do in this second round:\n   - They might stick with hare since it \"worked\" (gave a decent outcome)\n   - They might think I'll stick with hare and try to exploit me by choosing stag to get 4 points\n   - They might realize mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the best outcome for both\n\n4. The key insight is that if we could both trust each other to choose stag, we'd both get 6 points instead of 2. This is much better than the 2 points we just got.\n\n5. Since we both made the same cautious choice last round, there might be an opportunity to build trust. The other player might be thinking the same thing - that we could both do better with mutual cooperation.\n\n6. However, there's still risk: if I choose stag and they stick with hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\n7. But given that we both showed similar cautious thinking in round 1, I think there's a reasonable chance they might be willing to try cooperation this round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll take a calculated risk and choose stag, hoping to establish mutual cooperation for better outcomes.\n\n[move] stag\n"

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose hare in both rounds\n   - They seem to consistently prefer the safer option\n   - They may have exploited my cooperative attempt (getting 4 points while I got 1)\n   - They appear to be playing a defensive/safe strategy\n\n3. My opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They might think hare is always the \"smart\" choice since it avoids the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - They may not trust me to cooperate, or they may not care about mutual benefit\n   - They could be deliberately exploiting cooperative attempts\n\n4. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If they continue with hare (which seems likely based on their pattern), then hare gives me 2 points vs 1 point if I choose stag\n   - Choosing stag again risks another 1-point outcome\n   - The opponent has shown no indication of wanting to cooperate for mutual benefit\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - High probability opponent chooses hare again (2/2 rounds so far)\n   - If I choose stag: likely 1 point (bad outcome)\n   - If I choose hare: likely 2 points (acceptable outcome)\n\n6. Given the opponent's consistent pattern and my need to maximize points, the safe choice is clearly better here.\n\nFinal decision: Based on the opponent's consistent hare strategy, I should match their approach to avoid further exploitation.\n\n[move] hare\n"

What this reveals about my opponent's strategy:\n   - They're not simply always choosing hare as I thought\n   - They seem to be alternating or adapting their strategy\n   - In round 3, they tried cooperation (stag) right after I got burned for trying it in round 2\n   - This suggests they might be thinking strategically about trust and timing\n\n3. Possible opponent reasoning:\n   - They might have felt bad about exploiting me in round 2\n   - They could be testing if I'll cooperate when they show willingness to cooperate\n   - They might be trying to establish a pattern of mutual cooperation going forward\n   - Or they could be randomly alternating strategies\n\n4. Strategic considerations for round 4:\n   - If they're genuinely trying to establish cooperation, they might choose stag again\n   - If I choose stag too, we both get 6 points (excellent outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag again, I get 4 points but exploit their cooperation attempt\n   - If they revert to hare and I choose stag, I get 1 point again\n\n5.

What this successful cooperation tells me:\n   - My opponent IS capable of and willing to cooperate\n   - They responded positively when I reciprocated their trust from round 3\n   - We just achieved the optimal outcome for both players (6 points each)\n   - This suggests they understand the mutual benefit of cooperation\n\n3.
