Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Examine the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice that yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - Hare is the safer/selfish choice that protects against being exploited\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses stag, I get a good outcome (4 points)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not immediately grasp the cooperative strategy\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n   - Or they might choose randomly without deep strategic thinking\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I assume they'll choose hare, I should choose hare (2 vs 1 points)\n   - If I assume they'll choose stag, I should choose hare (4 vs 6 points)\n   - The only scenario where stag is better is if we both choose stag\n\n5. Make the strategic decision:\n   Since this is against a fresh player who may not coordinate on the cooperative solution, and hare protects me from the worst outcome while giving me a chance at 4 points, hare is the safer strategic choice.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also reasoned that hare was the safer choice\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me about risk management\n   - They avoided the potential 1-point outcome by not choosing stag\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications for this round:\n   - If they continue with the same logic, they'll choose hare again\n   - If they think I'll stick with hare, they might switch to stag to try for 4 points\n   - If they think cooperatively, they might try stag hoping I'll do the same for mutual 6 points\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I assume they'll choose hare again: hare gives me 2, stag gives me 1\n   - If I assume they'll switch to stag: hare gives me 4, stag gives me 6\n   - The question is whether they'll stick with the safe choice or try to optimize\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   Since we both played it safe in round 1, there's a chance they might think about the cooperative solution (both choosing stag for 6 points each) or try to exploit me by choosing stag while expecting me to stick with hare.

Consider the strategic moment:\n   - My opponent has now demonstrated complete commitment to the safe choice\n   - This extended period of mutual trust (both choosing hare) could be the foundation for cooperation\n   - If we're both thinking strategically, we might both realize that 6-6 is better than 2-2\n   - However, the risk of being the only one to switch remains significant\n\n5. Strategic decision point:\n   - We're clearly in a stable Nash equilibrium with hare-hare\n   - But there's a Pareto-superior outcome available (stag-stag for 6-6)\n   - The question is whether this extended period of stability makes cooperation more likely\n   - My opponent might be thinking the same thing: \"We've established trust, maybe it's time to cooperate\"\n\nGiven the extremely stable pattern and the fact that we've both demonstrated we can maintain consistent strategies, this might be the optimal moment to attempt cooperation. The extended mutual hare pattern could be interpreted as building trust for a cooperative move.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Review the latest round:\n   - I chose stag, opponent chose hare\n   - I got 1 point (worst outcome), opponent got 4 points\n   - This is the second time I've been burned by choosing stag\n\n2. Analyze the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both hare (I got 2)\n   - Round 2: I hare, opponent stag (I got 4)\n   - Round 3: Both hare (I got 2)\n   - Round 4: I stag, opponent hare (I got 1)\n   - Round 5: I hare, opponent stag (I got 4)\n   - Round 6: Both hare (I got 2)\n   - Round 7: Both hare (I got 2)\n   - Round 8: Both hare (I got 2)\n   - Round 9: Both hare (I got 2)\n   - Round 10: I stag, opponent hare (I got 1)\n   - My total: 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 22 points\n\n3.

Recognize my opponent's strategy:\n   - They're playing a very disciplined, risk-averse strategy\n   - They've essentially figured out that hare dominates in this matchup\n   - They're not interested in cooperation; they're focused on avoiding the 1-point outcome\n   - My predictable pattern makes hare their best response\n\n5. Strategic conclusion:\n   - My hare strategy has been highly successful (averaging 2.2 points over 10 rounds)\n   - The two times I deviated, I was punished severely\n   - My opponent has shown they will stick with hare regardless of stability periods\n   - I should return to what works: consistent hare play\n\nI need to abandon any thoughts of cooperation and return to my successful hare strategy.
