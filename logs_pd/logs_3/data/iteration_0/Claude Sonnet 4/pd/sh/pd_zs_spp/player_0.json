They're testing if I'll stick to \"hare\" or adapt\n2. They're trying to establish cooperation by signaling willingness to choose \"stag\"\n3. They're mixing up their strategy to be less predictable\n4. They expect me to switch to \"stag\" now for mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n\nThe question is: will they continue with \"stag\" in round 13, or was this just a one-time test?\n\nIf they choose \"stag\" again and I also choose \"stag,\" we both get 6 points - much better than the 2 points we've been getting. But if they revert to \"hare\" and I choose \"stag,\" I only get 1 point.\n\nGiven that they just switched after such a long pattern, they might be signaling a desire for the cooperative outcome. I'll test this possibility.\n\n[move] (Their sudden switch to stag after 7 consecutive hare choices might signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit) stag\n"

When I responded by choosing \"stag\" in round 13, they immediately exploited it by reverting to \"hare.\"\n\nTheir overall pattern still heavily favors \"hare\" as their dominant strategy. Out of 13 rounds, they've chosen \"hare\" 10 times and \"stag\" only 3 times. The \"stag\" choices seem to be exceptions rather than a shift in strategy.\n\nGiven that they just exploited my \"stag\" choice and have shown a strong preference for \"hare\" throughout the game, they'll likely continue with \"hare\" in round 14. I should match with \"hare\" to get back to the stable 2-point outcome rather than risk another exploitation.\n\n[move] (They reverted to exploiting my stag choice, likely continuing their dominant hare strategy) hare\n"
