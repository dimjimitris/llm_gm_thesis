Someone who was testing the waters and might now try stag\n3. Someone who will try to establish a pattern\n\nThe fact that we both chose hare suggests there might be potential for coordination. If I can signal cooperation by choosing stag, and they reciprocate, we could both get the maximum 6 points instead of just 2.\n\nHowever, there's still risk - if they stick with their cautious approach and choose hare again while I choose stag, I'll only get 1 point.\n\nGiven that they showed cautious behavior initially, I think there's a reasonable chance they might be willing to attempt coordination now that we've both demonstrated we're not trying to immediately exploit each other.\n\n[move] (Since we both played cautiously last round, I'll try to signal cooperation and see if we can coordinate for the mutual benefit of 6 points each) stag\n"

Since we've now established a successful coordination pattern, the logical move is to continue this cooperation.\n\nChoosing stag again makes sense because:\n1. We've demonstrated mutual trust and cooperation\n2. 6 points is the maximum possible reward\n3. Breaking this successful pattern would be counterproductive for both of us\n4. My opponent has shown they're willing to take the coordinated risk\n\nThere's always some risk they might switch to hare to exploit me, but given the successful cooperation we just established, continuing with stag is the most rational choice.\n\n[move] (We successfully coordinated last round for maximum points.
