At 6 points per round each, this is far superior to any other sustainable pattern we could establish.\n\nThere's no strategic reason to deviate from this successful pattern. Breaking cooperation now would:\n- Destroy the trust we've built\n- Return us to suboptimal outcomes\n- Risk reverting to defensive play or exploitation cycles\n\nThe cooperative equilibrium we've achieved is stable and mutually beneficial.

We've firmly established a stable cooperative partnership that's delivering optimal results for both players.\n\nThis sustained pattern demonstrates that we've both learned the value of trust and cooperation over short-term exploitation. The consistency shows genuine commitment from both sides - my opponent has proven reliable over multiple rounds, and I've reciprocated that reliability.\n\nAt this point, we have a well-functioning cooperative equilibrium that maximizes our mutual benefit. Any deviation would be counterproductive and potentially destructive to the trust we've built. The game theory clearly supports maintaining this pattern - 6 points per round each is the theoretical maximum for sustained play.\n\nThere's no rational reason to break this successful cooperation. We've found the optimal solution to the game.\n\n[move] (Continuing our proven successful cooperative strategy) stag\n"
