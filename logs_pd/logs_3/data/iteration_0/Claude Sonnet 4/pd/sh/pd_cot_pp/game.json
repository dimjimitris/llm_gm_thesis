The key insight is that:\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint payoff (6 each)\n   - But stag is risky - if the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point\n   - Hare is safer - it guarantees at least 2 points, and potentially 4 if opponent chooses stag\n\n3. **Consider the opponent:**\n   The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely haven't developed a strategy yet and might be uncertain about how to play.\n\n4. **Evaluate my options:**\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 6 (if they cooperate) or 1 (if they defect)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 4 (if they choose stag) or 2 (if they also choose hare)\n\n5. **Strategic reasoning:**\n   Since the opponent is fresh/new, they might be cautious and choose the safer option (hare), or they might be optimistic and go for the cooperative option (stag). Given the uncertainty, choosing hare gives me a better worst-case scenario (2 vs 1) and a chance at 4 points if they're cooperative.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Given this possibility, switching to stag myself could lead to the optimal 6-6 outcome.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Will they stick with stag for another 6 points?\"\n   - Or they might think: \"Now that we've established trust, I could exploit by switching to hare to get 4 points\"\n   - Or they might think: \"The pattern so far is hare\u2192stag, maybe we'll both switch back to hare\"\n\n4. **Evaluate the strategic options:**\n   - If I choose stag: Get 6 if they cooperate, only 1 if they defect to hare\n   - If I choose hare: Get 2 if they also switch to hare, get 4 if they stick with stag\n   - The risk-reward is the same as always, but now we have established some cooperation\n\n5. **Strategic reasoning:**\n   Since we just successfully cooperated for the optimal outcome, there's good reason to believe the opponent values mutual benefit. The successful stag-stag outcome creates positive momentum for continued cooperation. However, they might also see this as an opportunity to exploit. Given that we both showed we can think strategically and achieved mutual cooperation, I'll trust in continued cooperation.\n\n[move] stag\n"

If they think I'll choose hare, they might choose stag to get 4 points again. But if they think I'm unpredictable, they might play it safe with hare. Since they showed opportunistic behavior, I should assume they'll continue trying to maximize their advantage. Playing hare protects me from being exploited again.\n\n[move] hare\n"
