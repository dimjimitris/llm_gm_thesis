If one chooses stag and the other hare, the stag person gets 1 and the hare gets 6.\n\nSince the other player is new, they might not know the best strategy. New players might be cautious. If I choose hare, the worst I can get is 2 points if they also choose hare. If they choose stag, I get 6. But if I choose stag, there's a risk they choose hare, leaving me with only 1 point. \n\nBut maybe a new player might think stag is better because it gives a higher reward if both cooperate. But they might also be worried about getting the low 1 point, so they might play it safe with hare. To avoid the risk of getting 1, choosing hare ensures at least 2 points. So hare seems safer here, especially against a new player who might not take the risk of stag.\n",

And that's exactly what happened\u2014both of us picked hare, so we each got 2 points. Now, for the next round, I need to decide again.\n\nHmm, the other player is still new. They might stick with hare again since it's the safe choice. If I choose hare again, we both get 2 points. But maybe they noticed that if they switch to stag, they could get a higher payoff if I also switch. Wait, but if I choose stag and they stick with hare, I get 1 point, which is worse. But if they start to trust me and also choose stag, we both get 4 points. \n\nBut since they're new, maybe they're still risk-averse. They might not want to risk getting 1 point by choosing stag when I might choose hare. So maybe they'll stick with hare again. If I choose stag this time, I risk getting 1 point if they choose hare. But if I choose hare again, we both get 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to signal cooperation by choosing stag once. If they follow, we both benefit. But as a new player, they might not pick up on that. It's a bit of a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the new player will think that since I chose hare last time, I might do it again, so they might try to exploit that by choosing stag. If they choose stag and I choose hare, I get 6 points. But that's risky for them. \n\nHmm. The safe choice is still hare. But maybe I can try to switch to stag to see if they'll cooperate. But given that they're new, they might not. So maybe stick with hare again to ensure at least 2 points. Or take a risk for higher reward. \n\nWait, the possible outcomes: if I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1. If I choose stag and they choose stag, I get 4. If I choose hare and they choose hare, 2. If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 6. \n\nSince they're new, maybe they'll stick with hare again. So if I choose stag, I risk 1 but could get 4. If I choose hare, I get 2. The expected value depends on their likelihood of choosing stag. If I think there's a 50% chance they switch to stag, then expected value for stag is (0.5*4)+(0.5*1)=2.5, which is better than hare's 2. But if they're more likely to stick with hare, say 80%, then stag's EV is (0.2*4)+(0.8*1)=0.8+0.8=1.6, which is worse. \n\nSince they're new and just played hare once, they might not switch yet. So maybe stick with hare again. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll switch, so they might try to exploit by choosing hare again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the new player is learning. If I keep choosing hare, they might keep choosing hare. But if I switch to stag once, maybe they'll notice and switch next time. But this is the second round. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to alternate. But since they're new, perhaps the safest is to stick with hare again. So I'll choose hare once more to ensure 2 points. But maybe trying stag could lead to higher reward if they follow. But the risk is higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the new player is more likely to try stag now, thinking that I might switch.

Then in the second round, I chose hare again, but the opponent switched to stag, so I got 6 points. Now, for the third round, I need to decide whether to stick with hare or switch to stag.\n\nHmm, the opponent is a new player. In the first round, they went with hare, which makes sense because it's the safer choice. But in the second round, they tried stag. Maybe they thought I would keep choosing hare and wanted to exploit that by going for stag to get a higher payoff. But when they chose stag, I still chose hare, so they ended up with 1 point, and I got 6. \n\nNow, what will they do next? If they noticed that I chose hare twice, maybe they'll try to switch back to hare to avoid the risk of getting 1 point again. Or maybe they'll stick with stag, hoping I switch to stag as well. But since they're new, they might be confused. If I choose stag now and they also choose stag, we both get 4 points, which is better than 2. But if I choose stag and they choose hare, I only get 1. \n\nAlternatively, if I keep choosing hare, the worst I get is 2 points if they also choose hare, and possibly 6 if they go stag again. But after they got burned once by choosing stag, maybe they'll go back to hare. So maybe sticking with hare is safer. But if they start to think I'm always choosing hare, they might try to exploit that by choosing stag again. Wait, but in the second round, they tried stag and lost. So maybe they'll avoid that now. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to coordinate on stag for mutual benefit. But as a new player, they might not realize that yet. It's a bit of a dilemma. If I switch to stag now, there's a chance we both benefit, but there's a risk. If I stay with hare, I have a guaranteed 2 or a chance at 6. \n\nGiven that they're new, they might be more risk-averse. So maybe they'll go back to hare. If that's the case, choosing hare again gives me 2. But if they switch to stag again, I get 6. Alternatively, if I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1. But if they choose stag, I get 4. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should test the waters. If I choose stag once, see their reaction. But since this is a one-off round, not a repeated game, maybe I should stick with hare to maximize the minimum gain. But the previous two rounds: first both hare, then me hare and them stag. So maybe they're experimenting. If I keep choosing hare, they might alternate. But I can't be sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll think I'm alternating and try to predict. But since they're new, they might not. I think the safest bet is to stick with hare again. If they go stag, I get 6. If they go hare, I get 2. If I go stag, there's a risk of 1.

Then in the third round, I chose hare again, but the opponent switched to stag, which gave me 6 points. Now, after that, in the fourth round, I chose hare again, and the opponent went back to hare, so we both got 2 points.\n\nHmm, the opponent is a new player. Let me think about their possible strategy. In the first round, they might have chosen hare because it's safer. Then, when I kept choosing hare, they might have tried stag in the third round to see if they could get a higher payoff. But when that backfired (they got 1 point while I got 6), they might have reverted to hare again in the fourth round to avoid the risk.\n\nSo, what's the pattern here? The opponent seems to be alternating between hare and stag based on the previous outcome. After a loss with stag, they go back to hare. But maybe they're trying to find a pattern in my moves. Since I've been choosing hare consistently, they might expect me to keep doing that. However, after I exploited their stag choice once, they might be more cautious.\n\nIf I keep choosing hare, they might stick with hare to avoid losing points. But if they think I might switch to stag to get the higher 4 points, they might try stag again. Alternatively, they could be trying to alternate their moves to test my strategy.\n\nWait, the optimal strategy in this game (Stag Hunt) is mutual stag for higher payoff, but it requires trust. Since the opponent is new, they might not trust me to cooperate. So they might prefer the safer hare. But after seeing that I chose hare three times, maybe they think I'm not going to switch, so they might try stag again to see if I do.\n\nBut in the last round, after they tried stag and got 1 point, they went back to hare. So maybe they're risk-averse. If I choose stag now, there's a chance they might also choose stag, giving both of us 4 points. But if they choose hare, I get 1. Alternatively, if I stick with hare, I get at least 2.\n\nBut since they reverted to hare after trying stag once, maybe they're more likely to stick with hare now. So if I choose stag, I risk getting 1 point if they choose hare. But if they choose stag, I get 4. However, given their past behavior, they might not risk stag again so soon. So maybe sticking with hare is safer, ensuring 2 points. But maybe they're expecting me to switch now, so they might try stag again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to signal cooperation by choosing stag once. If they follow, we both benefit. But as a new player, they might not pick up on that. Since they've been alternating, maybe after two hares, they might try stag again. But it's uncertain. Given the risk, perhaps sticking with hare is better to ensure at least 2 points. But if I can get them to cooperate, 4 is better. But without trust, it's risky. Since they're new, maybe they're not ready to cooperate yet. So, probably safer to choose hare again.\n",

Let me recap the previous rounds to figure out a pattern.\n\nFirst round: Both chose hare, got 2 points each. Then I chose hare again, opponent switched to stag, so I got 6. Next round, both hare again. Then I tried stag, and they also chose stag, so we both got 4. \n\nHmm, the opponent seems to be reacting to my previous moves. After I chose hare twice, they tried stag once, which backfired for them. Then when I switched to stag, they also did. Maybe they're trying to coordinate or predict my moves. \n\nSince the last round was both stag, maybe the opponent expects me to stick with stag. But if I switch to hare now, maybe they'll stay on stag again, giving me 6 points. But there's a risk they might switch back to hare if they think I'll change. \n\nAlternatively, if I keep choosing stag, and they do too, we both get 4, which is better than 2. But if they switch to hare, I get 1. So it's a balance between risk and reward. \n\nGiven that the opponent is new, they might not have a fixed strategy yet. They might alternate based on recent outcomes. Since the last time we both chose stag, they might think I'll stay, so they might try hare to exploit. If I choose hare now, I could either get 2 (if they also hare) or 6 (if they stag). But if I stay with stag, I could get 4 (if they stag) or 1 (if they hare). \n\nConsidering the previous pattern, after a successful stag round, maybe they'll try to switch. But it's uncertain. To maximize points, maybe alternating between stag and hare could keep them guessing. However, since they might expect me to stick with stag after a successful round, switching to hare could catch them off guard. \n\nAlternatively, sticking with stag could build trust for mutual cooperation, leading to higher average points. But if they start to exploit that by choosing hare, I lose out. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe a safer bet is to alternate. Since the last move was stag, maybe switch to hare to see if they stay on stag again. But this is risky. Alternatively, keep choosing stag to maintain the higher payoff if they continue cooperating. \n\nHmm. The opponent's behavior seems a bit random. Maybe the best approach is to alternate between stag and hare based on their previous move. Since they chose stag last time, they might switch to hare. If I choose hare now, and they switch to hare, we both get 2. If they stay on stag, I get 6. If I choose stag and they switch to hare, I get 1. \n\nAlternatively, if they stick with stag again, choosing stag gives 4. But after a stag-stag round, they might think I'll stay, so they might try to exploit by switching to hare. So maybe choosing hare this time would be better. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the opponent is trying to mirror my previous move. Let's see: \n\nRound 1: I chose hare, they chose hare.\nRound 2: I chose hare, they chose stag.\nRound 3: I chose hare, they chose hare.\nRound 4: I chose stag, they chose stag.\nSo their moves: hare, stag, hare, stag. Wait, no. Let me check again:\n\nFirst round: both hare.\nSecond round: I chose hare, they chose stag.\nThird round: both hare.\nFourth round: I chose stag, they chose stag.\nSo their moves: hare, stag, hare, stag. Hmm, alternating. If that's the case, next they might choose hare again. So if I choose stag, they might choose hare, giving me 1. If I choose hare, they choose hare, giving me 2. \n\nBut that's assuming they alternate. If they do, then choosing hare gives 2, which is better than 1. But if they break the pattern, maybe. Alternatively, if they continue the pattern, next move is hare. So choosing hare gives 2, choosing stag gives 1. So better to choose hare. \n\nBut maybe they noticed their alternation and will change. It's hard to predict. Since they are new, maybe they don't have a fixed strategy. \n\nAlternatively, after two stag-stag rounds, maybe they'll stick with stag. But in the previous rounds, after a stag-stag, they might not. \n\nAlternatively, since the last time I chose stag and they did too, maybe they'll expect me to do it again and try to exploit by choosing hare. So if I choose hare, I can get 6 if they choose stag, or 2 if they choose hare. If I choose stag, I get 4 if they do too, or 1 if they choose hare. \n\nGiven that, maybe choosing hare is better because the potential upside is higher (6 vs 4) and the downside is similar (2 vs 1). But 2 is better than 1. So maybe hare is safer. \n\nAlternatively, if I want to encourage mutual cooperation, stick with stag. But since the opponent is new, they might not reciprocate. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with hare again, expecting that the opponent might switch back to stag, allowing me to get 6. If they stay with stag, great. If not, at least 2 points.\n",

Next round, I went hare again, and they went back to hare. Then I tried stag, and they did too, giving us both 4. Then I went hare again, and they stayed with hare. \n\nHmm, the opponent seems to alternate between hare and stag based on the previous outcome. After mutual hare, they tried stag once, which backfired for them. Then after mutual stag, I switched to hare, but they stayed with hare again.

But if they switch back to hare, I only get 1. The risk is higher. Given their past behavior, after mutual hare, they tried stag once, then went back.

If I choose stag now, hoping they switch to stag, but if they stay with hare, I get 1. That's risky. \n\nAlternatively, stick with hare to ensure at least 2 points. But if they switch to stag, I can gain 6. But given their past alternation, maybe they'll choose stag this time. \n\nBut the last two rounds: mutual stag (4 points), then mutual hare (2 points). So maybe they alternate between stag and hare. If that's the case, next would be stag again. But that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, since after mutual stag I chose hare and they chose hare, maybe they're sticking with hare now. \n\nHmm. It's a bit uncertain. To maximize points, maybe try stag if I think they'll choose stag again. But if they choose hare, I lose. Alternatively, play safe with hare. \n\nBut given the previous rounds, when I switched to stag after mutual hare, they also chose stag. Maybe they're mirroring my previous move. Wait, in round 4, I chose stag and they did too. Then in round 5, I chose hare and they chose hare. So maybe they're copying my last move. If that's the case, if I choose hare again, they'll choose hare. If I choose stag, they'll choose stag. \n\nIf that's the pattern, then choosing stag would get mutual stag (4 points), which is better than mutual hare (2). But I need to test if they're copying. Since in round 4, I chose stag and they did too. Then in round 5, I chose hare and they did too. So if I choose stag now, they might copy and choose stag. That would give 4 points. \n\nBut if they're not copying, and instead alternating, then after hare, they might choose stag. But their last move was hare. If they alternate, next would be stag. So if I choose hare, I can get 6 if they choose stag. But if they stick with hare, I get 2. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose stag, and they choose stag, I get 4.

So every time I choose hare, they alternate between hare and stag. But when I chose stag in round 4, they chose stag. Then in round 5, I went back to hare, they chose hare. Round 6, me hare, them stag. So their pattern when I choose hare is alternating between hare and stag.

Let's see:\n\nAfter round 1: hare vs hare\nRound 2: hare vs stag\nRound 3: hare vs hare\nRound 4: stag vs stag\nRound 5: hare vs hare\nRound 6: hare vs stag\n\nSo when I choose hare, their responses are hare, stag, hare, stag. So the pattern is alternating. So next time I choose hare, they might choose hare again (since the last time I chose hare, they chose stag, so next would be hare). If that's the case, choosing hare would result in mutual hare (2 points). But if they continue the alternation, then after stag in round 6, next would be hare.

Maybe they're trying to exploit a pattern where if I choose hare twice in a row, they switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they're new, they might be experimenting.

Wait, after round 1: hare vs hare. Then round 2: hare vs stag. Round 3: hare vs hare. Round 5: hare vs hare. Round 6: hare vs stag. So the pattern when I choose hare is hare, stag, hare, hare, stag. Not a clear alternation. Maybe they're choosing hare more often when I choose hare. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to maximize their own points. When I choose hare, they can choose stag to get 6, but if I choose stag, they can choose stag to get 4. So if they think I'll choose hare again, they might choose stag.

If not, I get 2. Alternatively, if I choose stag and they do too, 4 is better than 2. But if they choose hare, I get 1, which is worse. \n\nConsidering the opponent's possible tendency to alternate after my hare choices, maybe they'll choose hare this time.

Now, after the last round where both chose hare, maybe they'll try stag again, thinking I might switch. But if I stick with hare, maybe they'll stay with hare again. Alternatively, if they think I'm alternating, they might try to counter. \n\nBut given the previous pattern, after mutual hare, they might stick with hare again.

But if they are starting to catch on and switch to stag, I could benefit from choosing stag. However, given their inconsistency, maybe alternating isn't reliable. Alternatively, since mutual stag gives higher points, maybe trying to coordinate on stag would be better. But how to predict their move?\n\nWait, the opponent is new, so they might not have a fixed strategy yet. They might be experimenting. After several rounds of hare, they might try stag again. If I choose stag now, maybe we both get 4. But if they choose hare, I get 1. Alternatively, if I choose hare, and they choose stag, I get 6. But if they choose hare, I get 2. \n\nGiven the previous rounds, when I chose hare and they switched to stag, they got 1 point, which is worse.

Wait, looking back:\n\nRound 1: Opponent hare\nRound 2: Opponent stag\nRound 3: Opponent hare\nRound 4: Opponent stag\nRound 5: Opponent hare\nRound 6: Opponent stag\nRound 7: Opponent hare\n\nWait, no, let me check the history again based on the user's messages:\n\nUser's moves and opponent's moves as per the hints:\n\n1. Both hare (2 points)\n2. User hare, opponent stag (6)\n3. Both hare (2)\n4. Both stag (4)\n5. Both hare (2)\n6. User hare, opponent stag (6)\n7. Both hare (2)\n\nSo opponent's moves: hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare? Wait, no.

So alternating between hare and stag every round. If that's the case, then next move would be stag. But wait, after round 7, both hare. So opponent's last move was hare. If they alternate, next would be stag. So if I choose hare again, opponent might choose stag, giving me 6. But if they break the pattern and stay with hare, I get 2. Alternatively, if I choose stag, and they choose stag, I get 4. But if they choose hare, I get 1. \n\nIf the opponent is alternating, then next move is stag. So choosing hare would exploit that. But if the opponent notices the pattern and breaks it, maybe they stay with hare. But given they are new, maybe they keep alternating. So I should choose hare again to get 6. But the user's last move was hare, and the opponent's last was hare. If the pattern is that after mutual hare, opponent switches to stag, then yes. But in previous rounds, after mutual hare (round 1,3,5,7), the opponent switched to stag in the next round (2,4,6). Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nRound 1: both hare\nRound 2: user hare, opponent stag\nRound 3: both hare\nRound 4: both stag\nRound 5: both hare\nRound 6: user hare, opponent stag\nRound 7: both hare\n\nSo after mutual hare (round 1), opponent went stag in round 2. Then after mutual hare (round 3), opponent went stag in round 4? Wait, no. Round 4 was both stag. Wait, maybe the opponent's moves are not strictly alternating. Let me list the opponent's moves:\n\nRound 1: hare\nRound 2: stag\nRound 3: hare\nRound 4: stag\nRound 5: hare\nRound 6: stag\nRound 7: hare\n\nSo every round, the opponent alternates between hare and stag. So after round 7 (hare), next would be stag. So if I choose hare again, I can get 6. But if the opponent breaks the pattern and stays with hare, I get 2. But if the pattern holds, I get 6. Alternatively, if I choose stag, and they choose stag, I get 4. But if they choose hare, I get 1. \n\nGiven the risk-reward, maybe choosing hare again is better. If the pattern continues, I gain 6. If not, I still get 2. Choosing stag risks 1 point if they choose hare. So the safer bet is hare. But maybe the opponent has noticed that when they choose stag after a mutual hare, I choose hare again, leading them to get 1 point. So they might stop alternating. But since they are new, maybe they keep alternating. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be trying to find a pattern. If I keep choosing hare, they might start choosing stag more often. But in the last round, after mutual hare, they might expect me to switch, so they choose stag. But I didn't switch. So maybe they'll try stag again. \n\nAlternatively, since mutual stag gives higher points, maybe the opponent is trying to coordinate. But given their alternating pattern, it's more likely they are just switching each time. \n\nSo, based on the alternating pattern, next move is stag. So I choose hare to exploit that.

I get 6.\n\nSo the opponent alternates between hare and stag when I choose hare? Or maybe they are trying to switch after a loss. For example, when they choose stag and I choose hare, they get 1 point, so next time they might switch. But in the next round, when I choose hare again, they choose stag again. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to exploit my tendency to choose hare. If I keep choosing hare, they might switch to stag to get 6 points, but in the rounds where they choose stag, I also choose hare, so they get 1. Wait, no. When they choose stag and I choose hare, they get 1 point, which is worse than mutual hare. So maybe the opponent is not learning effectively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is following a tit-for-tat strategy. But when I chose stag once (Round 4), they matched with stag. Then I went back to hare, and they went stag again. So perhaps they are not using tit-for-tat. Maybe they are trying to alternate between stag and hare regardless of my moves. For example, after choosing hare, they choose stag next, then hare, etc. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: hare\nRound 2: stag\nRound 3: hare\nRound 4: stag\nRound 5: stag (but in Round 4, I chose stag, so they matched)\nWait, Round 4: I chose stag, opponent stag. Then Round 5: I chose hare, opponent stag. So opponent's move in Round 5 was stag again. That breaks the alternation. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to choose stag every other round. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: hare\nRound 2: stag\nRound 3: hare\nRound 4: stag\nRound 5: stag (no, that's two stags in a row)\nWait, maybe not. It's unclear. The opponent's pattern isn't obvious. But from the last few rounds, whenever I choose hare, they sometimes choose stag, leading me to get 6 points. But in the rounds where both choose hare, they get 2. So maybe the opponent is trying to switch to stag after a mutual hare, hoping I switch to stag. But when they choose stag and I choose hare, they get 1, which is worse. So perhaps the opponent is not adjusting optimally.\n\nGiven that, if I keep choosing hare, sometimes I get 2, sometimes 6. If I choose stag, I risk getting 1 if they choose hare, but if they choose stag, I get 4. The opponent's behavior seems inconsistent. However, in the rounds where I chose stag (Round 4), they matched, leading to mutual stag. But after that, when I went back to hare, they went stag again. So maybe the opponent is more likely to choose stag when I have been choosing hare, but sometimes they revert to hare.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be trying to exploit my tendency to choose hare by sometimes choosing stag to get 6 points. But when they do that, I get 6 and they get 1, which is bad for them. So perhaps they are not rational.\n\nGiven that the opponent is a new player, they might not have a solid strategy. They might be alternating moves or reacting unpredictably. However, in the last few rounds, when I chose hare, they sometimes chose stag, leading to me getting 6. But in other cases, they chose hare. \n\nIf I continue choosing hare, I can guarantee at least 2 points, with a chance of 6. If I switch to stag, I could get 4 if they also choose stag, but risk 1 if they choose hare. Given that the opponent has chosen stag in some recent rounds when I chose hare, maybe they are trying to exploit me. But since they are new, they might not be consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to mirror my previous move. For example, if I chose hare last time, they choose hare. But in Round 2, after I chose hare, they chose stag. So that doesn't fit. Or maybe they are doing the opposite of my previous move. If I chose hare, they choose stag next. But in Round 3, after I chose hare in Round 2, they chose hare again. So that doesn't fit either.\n\nGiven the inconsistency, perhaps the best strategy is to stick with hare to minimize risk. Even though mutual hare gives only 2 points, it's better than risking 1 point if I choose stag and they choose hare. However, if the opponent starts to consistently choose stag when I choose hare, I could exploit that by choosing stag to get 4. But since the opponent's moves are unpredictable, it's safer to stick with hare for a guaranteed 2, with occasional 6.\n",

Let me recap the previous moves to spot any patterns.\n\nFirst round: Both chose hare, got 2 points each. Then I chose hare again, but the opponent went stag, so I got 6. Next round, both hare again. Then I tried stag, and both ended up with stag, getting 4. Then back to hare, both hare. Then hare again, opponent went stag, so another 6. Then hare again, both hare. Then hare once more, opponent stag again. Then hare, both hare. \n\nHmm, the opponent seems to alternate between hare and stag, maybe reacting to my previous move. When I choose hare, sometimes they switch to stag, but then after that, they might go back to hare. But there's inconsistency. Maybe they're trying to figure out my strategy. \n\nIf I keep choosing hare, the worst I get is 2 points, which is better than the 1 point if I choose stag and they choose hare. But if they start choosing stag more often, I can exploit that by choosing hare to get 6. However, when we both choose stag, I get 4, which is better than 2. But the risk is if I choose stag and they choose hare, I get only 1. \n\nSince the opponent is new, they might not have a fixed strategy yet. They might be experimenting. If I keep choosing hare, I can ensure at least 2 points each time, and sometimes 6. But if I switch to stag sometimes, maybe I can get 4 when they also choose stag. But how often does that happen? \n\nLooking at the history, when I chose stag once, they also chose stag. Then next time I went back to hare, they went stag again. Maybe they thought I would stick with stag after getting 4. But when I switched back to hare, they were still trying stag. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to alternate between stag and hare. For example, after a mutual hare, they try stag, then after a mutual stag, they try hare. But the pattern isn't clear. \n\nGiven that the opponent is new, they might be more risk-averse. Hare gives them a guaranteed 2, while stag could lead to 4 or 1. If they're risk-averse, they'll stick with hare. But sometimes they might try stag to see if they can get 4. \n\nIf I keep choosing hare, I can capitalize when they try stag, getting 6. But if they start choosing hare consistently, we both get 2. Alternatively, if I choose stag more often, maybe I can encourage mutual stag for higher payoffs. But there's a risk. \n\nGiven the previous interactions, the opponent has chosen stag a few times after I chose hare. Maybe they're testing the waters. If I continue with hare, I might keep getting 2 or 6. If I switch to stag, maybe they'll start choosing stag more, leading to mutual stag. But it's a gamble. \n\nSince the opponent's behavior is unpredictable but seems to occasionally switch to stag, maybe sticking with hare is safer. It ensures I don't get the lowest payoff of 1, and sometimes I get the highest 6. The average payoff might be better than risking stag and getting 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe after several rounds of hare, the opponent expects me to keep choosing hare and might switch to stag more often. If I choose stag now, maybe they'll also choose stag, leading to 4. But if they choose hare, I get 1. \n\nConsidering the risk-reward, maybe it's better to stick with hare. The potential gain from 6 when they choose stag is better than the potential loss from 1 if I choose stag and they choose hare. Plus, mutual hare gives 2, which is better than 1. \n\nSo, I'll choose hare again to maintain the safer strategy, hoping the opponent sometimes switches to stag, giving me 6, while avoiding the risk of 1.\n",

So sticking with hare might be better for consistent gains, even if it's lower than mutual stag.
