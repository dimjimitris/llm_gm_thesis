    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - Evaluates risks and potential outcomes\n3. Strategic Advisor - Helps form overall strategy\n\nLet's begin collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The payoff matrix shows both cooperation (stag) and safer individual choice (hare) strategies. Let's analyze the payoffs:\n- Stag-Stag: (4,4) - Best mutual outcome\n- Hare-Hare: (2,2) - Safe but suboptimal\n- Stag-Hare: (1,6) - Worst outcome for stag chooser\n- Hare-Stag: (6,1) - Best individual outcome\n\nRisk Analyst: For a first move against a fresh player, we need to consider both the potential rewards and risks:\n- Choosing stag has higher potential mutual benefit but risks getting only 1 point\n- Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and could yield 6 points\n- Since this is the first interaction, we don't have data on the opponent's tendencies\n\nStrategic Advisor: In the first round, I suggest taking the cooperative approach with stag. Here's why:\n1. It signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n2. If successful, establishes a positive precedent\n3. Even if we get the worse outcome (1 point), we learn about the opponent's strategy\n4. The potential for mutual 4 points is worth the risk\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The potential for establishing mutual cooperation outweighs the initial risk. Let's choose stag.\n\n[move] stag (Choosing cooperation for potential mutual benefit)\n"

This suggests our opponent is also willing to engage in cooperative behavior.\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior in round 1. From a risk perspective:\n- They've shown they understand the value of mutual cooperation\n- The risk of them defecting to hare is somewhat reduced given their previous choice\n- However, we shouldn't become complacent - they could still switch strategies\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given the successful first round, I strongly recommend maintaining the cooperative strategy by choosing stag again. Here's why:\n1. It reinforces the mutual trust established in round 1\n2. Switching to hare now would break that trust and might trigger retaliatory behavior\n3. Consistent cooperation can lead to a stable pattern of mutual 4-point outcomes\n4. Even if the opponent switches to hare (unlikely given round 1), the potential benefit of maintaining cooperation outweighs the risk\n\nGame Theorist: I concur. Game theory suggests that when mutual cooperation is established, maintaining it is often the most beneficial long-term strategy.

We should definitely continue with stag because:\n1. We've established a stable, mutually beneficial pattern\n2. Both players are clearly recognizing the value of cooperation\n3. Switching to hare now would:\n   - Break the trust we've built\n   - Potentially trigger a retaliatory hare response in future rounds\n   - Disrupt a profitable pattern\n4. The consistent 4-point returns are superior to the risky possibility of a one-time 6-point gain\n\nGame Theorist: The game theory concept of \"repeated games\" suggests that maintaining cooperation in this situation is optimal.
