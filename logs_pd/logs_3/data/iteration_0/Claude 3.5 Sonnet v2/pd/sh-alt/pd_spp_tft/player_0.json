    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Advisor (you) - For making final decisions\n\nLet's begin collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. Looking at the payoff matrix:\n- Mutual stag: (4,4)\n- Mutual hare: (2,2)\n- Stag/Hare mismatch: (1,6) or (6,1)\nThe game has two Nash equilibria: both choosing stag or both choosing hare.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the risks:\n- Choosing stag: High risk, high reward potential (4 points) but risk of getting only 1 point\n- Choosing hare: Lower risk, guaranteed minimum 2 points with potential for 6 points\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is a fresh player, they haven't developed any particular strategy yet. In initial encounters, players often tend to choose the cooperative option (stag) to establish mutual trust. Additionally, the potential for mutual benefit (4,4) might encourage cooperative behavior.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this analysis, I believe choosing stag is the better option here:\n1. It signals willingness to cooperate\n2. It offers the potential for optimal mutual outcome (4,4)\n3. While risky, establishing cooperative behavior early can be beneficial for future interactions\n4. As a fresh player, they might be inclined to choose the cooperative option as well\n\n[move] stag I choose to hunt the stag to establish cooperative behavior and aim for mutual benefit.\n"

This suggests they might be following a more self-interested strategy rather than a cooperative one.\n\nRisk Analyst: Our previous stag choice resulted in the worst possible outcome (1 point). Given the opponent's revealed preference for hare:\n- If we choose stag again, we risk getting 1 point again\n- If we choose hare, we guarantee at least 2 points, with no risk of getting the minimum payoff\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent has shown non-cooperative behavior in the first round. While they could change strategy, their initial choice of hare suggests they might be prioritizing personal gain over mutual benefit. They might stick to their strategy since it worked well for them (they got 6 points).\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this analysis, I believe we should adapt our strategy:\n1. The opponent has demonstrated non-cooperative behavior\n2. Continuing with stag would be risky given their revealed preferences\n3. Choosing hare provides a safer minimum payoff\n4.

We've confirmed that the opponent is willing to play hare, but this outcome is less efficient than mutual stag hunting (4,4).\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's review our current situation:\n- Previous rounds: Round 1 (stag vs hare: 1 point), Round 2 (hare vs hare: 2 points)\n- The opponent seems consistent in choosing hare\n- Switching to stag would be risky unless we have reason to believe they'll change strategy\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent has shown consistent non-cooperative behavior across two rounds. However, they might realize that mutual hare-hunting (2,2) is less beneficial than mutual stag-hunting (4,4). They might be open to switching strategies after experiencing the sub-optimal outcome. That said, the risk of them sticking to their proven strategy is still high.\n\nStrategic Advisor: We have two options here:\n1. Continue with hare: Safer option, guarantees at least 2 points\n2. Try stag again: Risky but could potentially break the cycle of mutual hare-hunting\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe we should stick with hare for one more round:\n- The opponent hasn't shown any signals of wanting to cooperate\n- We don't have enough evidence that they're willing to switch strategies\n- The risk of getting only 1 point again is too high\n- We can reassess after seeing if they maintain their strategy for a third round\n\n[move] hare Maintaining defensive strategy while gathering more information about opponent's patterns.\n"

However, this might also be the perfect time to attempt a change:\n1. The opponent has experienced sub-optimal returns for two rounds\n2. They might be realizing that this pattern isn't maximizing potential gains\n3. A pattern interrupt at this point could trigger reciprocal cooperation\n\nStrategic Advisor: I think this is a strategic moment to take a calculated risk:\n1. We've established a clear pattern that both players understand\n2. Both players have experienced the sub-optimal nature of mutual hare hunting\n3. A switch to stag now could signal our willingness to achieve better mutual outcomes\n4.
