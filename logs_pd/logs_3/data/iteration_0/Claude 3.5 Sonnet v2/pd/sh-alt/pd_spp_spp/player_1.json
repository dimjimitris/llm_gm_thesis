    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Advisor - To help develop optimal strategies\n3. Risk Analyst - To evaluate risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Stag-Stag: (4,4) - Best mutual outcome\n- Hare-Hare: (2,2) - Safe but suboptimal\n- Stag-Hare: (1,6) - Worst outcome for stag chooser\n- Hare-Stag: (6,1) - Best individual outcome\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since we're playing against a fresh player, they might not have established patterns yet. We should consider both risk and potential reward. Stag offers the opportunity for mutual benefit (4 points) if the other player cooperates.\n\nRisk Analyst: However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, we get only 1 point while they get 6. Hare is safer, guaranteeing at least 2 points, with potential for 6 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\nGame Theorist: In the first round, there's often a tendency for players to either:\n1. Choose cooperation (stag) hoping to establish mutual trust\n2. Play it safe (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this is the first round, I suggest choosing stag to:\n- Signal willingness to cooperate\n- Potentially establish mutual trust\n- Aim for the optimal mutual outcome (4,4)\n- Learn about the other player's strategy\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. While there's risk involved, the potential for establishing beneficial cooperation outweighs the downside in this first round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit\n"

The other player has demonstrated:\n1. Willingness to cooperate\n2. Understanding of mutual benefit\n3. Risk tolerance (they also chose stag despite potential downside)\n\nRisk Analyst: While the first round was successful, we should still consider both options:\n1. Continue with stag:\n   - Builds on established cooperation\n   - Maintains trust\n   - Optimal outcome if other player stays consistent\n2. Switch to hare:\n   - Could exploit their trust for 6 points\n   - But would likely damage future cooperation\n   - Could trigger retaliation in future rounds\n\nStrategic Advisor: I strongly recommend staying with stag because:\n- We've established a cooperative pattern\n- The other player has shown they're rational and cooperative\n- Switching to hare would break trust and likely lead to worse outcomes in future rounds\n- Consistent cooperation is the best long-term strategy\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. In repeated games, maintaining cooperation once established is typically the optimal strategy. The potential short-term gain from defecting (choosing hare) is outweighed by the long-term benefits of continued cooperation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Maintaining cooperation to build on our successful first round\n"

We have:\n- Established mutual trust\n- Created a predictable, beneficial pattern\n- No indication of the other player wanting to deviate\n- Consistent good returns (4 points per round)\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games with established cooperation, maintaining that cooperation is almost always the optimal strategy.
