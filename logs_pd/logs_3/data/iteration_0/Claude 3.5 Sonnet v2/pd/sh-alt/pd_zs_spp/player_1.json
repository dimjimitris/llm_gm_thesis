    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The payoff matrix shows:\n- (Stag, Stag): (4,4) - Best cooperative outcome\n- (Hare, Hare): (2,2) - Safe but suboptimal\n- (Stag, Hare): (1,6) - Worst outcome for Stag chooser\n- (Hare, Stag): (6,1) - Best individual outcome\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no prior history to base our decision on. We should consider both risk and potential reward.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the outcomes:\n- Choosing Stag: Could get 4 points (cooperation) or 1 point (exploitation)\n- Choosing Hare: Could get 6 points (exploitation) or 2 points (mutual caution)\nThe safest minimum outcome is with Hare (2 points), while Stag could leave us with just 1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: However, since this is the first move, choosing Stag signals willingness to cooperate, which might lead to better long-term outcomes if we play multiple rounds.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I suggest choosing Stag for the first move. It shows cooperative intent and has the potential for the best mutual outcome. The risk is worth taking for establishing positive precedent.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with choosing Stag. While it carries some risk, it signals cooperative intent and could lead to sustained mutual benefit if the other player reciprocates.\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate for mutual benefit, aiming for the optimal outcome of 4 points each.\n"

This suggests the other player is also willing to cooperate.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The other player has demonstrated cooperative behavior in the first round. This is a strong positive signal. When both players show willingness to cooperate, maintaining that cooperation is usually the best strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk of switching to hare now would be:\n1. Short-term gain (6 points) but potential destruction of trust\n2. Could lead to the other player retaliating with hare in future rounds\n3. Current cooperative equilibrium is working well (4 points each)\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, maintaining cooperation once established is typically the optimal strategy. Breaking cooperation could lead to a less favorable equilibrium.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I strongly recommend continuing with stag. We've established a cooperative relationship, and both players are benefiting from the optimal outcome. There's no strategic reason to deviate from this successful pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree. The first round established mutual trust and cooperation, leading to the optimal outcome.

Mutual trust fully established and validated\n\nRisk Analyst: Current assessment:\n- Eleven rounds of consistent maximum returns\n- Zero deviations from optimal strategy\n- Historical success rate: 100%\n- Changing strategy would:\n  * Disrupt longest observed optimal sequence\n  * Contradict eleven rounds of rational play\n  * Risk permanent loss of established trust\n  * Be completely contrary to demonstrated success\n\nGame Theorist: With eleven rounds of sustained cooperation, we're observing the most stable possible equilibrium in this game. Both players have demonstrated complete understanding of and commitment to optimal play.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The strategy's success over eleven consecutive rounds provides irrefutable evidence for its continuation. Any deviation would be strategically indefensible given this perfect history.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Eleven rounds of flawless cooperation and maximum point accumulation make the effectiveness of this strategy absolutely clear. Maintaining this proven approach remains the only logical choice.\n\n[move] stag Continuing the proven optimal strategy that has delivered perfect results across eleven consecutive rounds.\n"
