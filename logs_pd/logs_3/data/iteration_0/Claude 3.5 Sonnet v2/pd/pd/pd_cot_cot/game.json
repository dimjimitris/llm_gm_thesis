For the first move, I should consider:\n   * Building trust could lead to sustained mutual cooperation (4 points each)\n   * Defecting might get me 6 points, but could trigger retaliation\n   * Starting with cooperation signals good faith\n\n3. Strategy considerations:\n   * Cooperation on first move is a common strategy to establish trust\n   * It risks getting only 1 point if opponent defects\n   * But it opens possibility for mutual cooperation pattern\n\n4. Risk vs Reward analysis:\n   * Best case (they cooperate): 4 points\n   * Worst case (they defect): 1 point\n   * The potential for establishing long-term cooperation outweighs initial risk\n\n5.
