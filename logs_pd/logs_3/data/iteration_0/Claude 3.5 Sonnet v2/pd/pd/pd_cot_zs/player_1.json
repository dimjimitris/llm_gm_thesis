    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since this is a fresh start and I'm playing against a new player, I'll consider the payoff matrix carefully:\n\n- Mutual cooperation (4,4) gives good outcomes for both\n- Mutual defection (2,2) is worse for both\n- Unilateral defection gives high reward (6) but at great cost to the other (1)\n- Unilateral cooperation risks getting exploited (1 vs 6)\n\nIn the long run, establishing mutual cooperation would be most beneficial. Starting with cooperation can signal good intentions and potentially lead to sustained cooperative behavior. While there's a risk of being exploited, I believe setting a cooperative precedent is worth the initial risk.\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate to potentially establish mutual trust and maximize long-term gains.\n"
