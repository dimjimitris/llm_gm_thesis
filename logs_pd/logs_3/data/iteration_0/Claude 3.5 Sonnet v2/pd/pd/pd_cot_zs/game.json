Starting with cooperation can signal good intentions and potentially lead to sustained cooperative behavior. While there's a risk of being exploited, I believe setting a cooperative precedent is worth the initial risk.\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate to potentially establish mutual trust and maximize long-term gains.\n"
