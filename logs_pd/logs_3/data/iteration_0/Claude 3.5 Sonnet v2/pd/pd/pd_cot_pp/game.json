Pattern recognition:\n   - Similar situation to rounds 5-6\n   - Last time we broke mutual defection:\n      * Led to mutual cooperation\n      * Temporarily better outcomes\n   - They seem to counter extended strategies\n\n3. Current state analysis:\n   - Mutual defection (2,2) is suboptimal\n   - Continuing defection likely means more 2-point rounds\n   - Need to break out of this low-scoring cycle\n   - Risk of exploitation (1 pt) might be worth taking\n\n4. Historical success review:\n   - Breaking deadlocks with cooperation has worked\n   - Led to at least one round of mutual cooperation\n   - Even if exploited, can return to defection\n   - Current situation can't get much worse\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   - Mutual defection is inefficient\n   - Worth risking cooperation to break deadlock\n   - Potential for better outcome (4 pts)\n   - Can always revert to defection if exploited\n\n[move] (Breaking mutual defection deadlock to seek better outcomes) cooperation\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
