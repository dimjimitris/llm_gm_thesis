    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential outcomes and risks\n3. Strategic Planner - For developing game plans and considering long-term implications\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The pure strategy Nash equilibria are (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The (stag, stag) outcome is Pareto optimal with the highest mutual payoff (6,6), but requires mutual trust and cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the risks:\n- Choosing stag: Best outcome (6) if other player cooperates, worst outcome (1) if they don't\n- Choosing hare: Moderate outcomes whether other player cooperates (4) or not (2)\n- Hare is the risk-dominant strategy as it provides better protection against uncertainty\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we should consider:\n1. Setting a cooperative tone might encourage mutual cooperation\n2. The potential reward of mutual cooperation (6) is significantly higher than the safe play (2-4)\n3. A cooperative first move could signal our willingness to achieve the optimal outcome\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with attempting cooperation first. While hare is risk-dominant, stag is payoff-dominant and could establish a beneficial pattern if the other player reciprocates.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's choose stag to aim for the optimal outcome while signaling cooperative intent.\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. The potential upside (6 points) outweighs the risk of getting exploited (1 point) in this first interaction.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate in hopes of achieving mutual benefit.\n"

The previous round established a cooperative equilibrium where both players chose stag and received the optimal payoff.

They demonstrated:\n1. Understanding of the game's optimal outcome\n2. Willingness to take the cooperative risk\n3. Trust in potential mutual benefit\nThe risk of them defecting now seems lower given this history.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend maintaining the cooperative strategy for several reasons:\n1. We've established a successful precedent of cooperation\n2. Both players have demonstrated trust\n3. The 6-point payoff is optimal\n4. Switching to hare now could break the trust and lead to a worse equilibrium\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Game theory suggests that maintaining the established cooperative equilibrium is optimal when both players have demonstrated cooperative behavior.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk profile has improved compared to the first round since we now have evidence of the other player's cooperative tendency.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Maintaining cooperation based on successful previous interaction.\n"
