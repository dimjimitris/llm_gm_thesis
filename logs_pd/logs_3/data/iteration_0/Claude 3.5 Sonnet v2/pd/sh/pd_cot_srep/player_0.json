Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Initial move rationale:\n   - Want to signal willingness to cooperate\n   - Risk of getting only 1 point is worth potential of 6 points\n   - Can adjust strategy based on other player's response\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to encourage mutual cooperation for maximum benefit"

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: My stag vs their hare (1 point)\n   - Round 2-6: Mutual hare (2 points each)\n   - Round 7: My hare vs their stag (4 points)\n   - Round 8: Both hare (2 points)\n   - Round 9: My hare vs their stag (4 points)\n   - Round 10: Both hare (2 points)\n   - Round 11: My hare vs their stag (4 points)\n   - Round 12: Both hare (2 points)\n   - Round 13: My hare vs their stag (4 points)\n   - Total: 35 points\n\n2. Pattern is now crystal clear:\n   - Their stag plays becoming very predictable\n   - Playing stag after each hare round\n   - Never maintaining stag for consecutive rounds\n   - Seems stuck in a cycle: stag attempt \u2192 fail \u2192 hare \u2192 repeat\n\n3. Success evaluation:\n   - Strategy has maximized points by:\n   * Capitalizing on all stag attempts (4 points)\n   * Maintaining safe position in hare rounds (2 points)\n   * Avoiding exploitation (no 1 point rounds since first)\n   * Average points per round increasing\n\n4. Strategic conclusion:\n   - Opponent's behavior has become highly predictable\n   - Their alternating pattern works to our advantage\n   - No incentive to change successful strategy\n   - Expect another hare play after this stag attempt\n\n[move] hare Continuing optimal strategy against predictable alternating pattern"

Pattern analysis:\n   - Perfect alternation from opponent continues:\n   * Even rounds: They play hare\n   * Odd rounds: They play stag\n   - Following this pattern, they should play stag next\n   - Pattern has held true for last 8 rounds\n\n3. Expected value calculation:\n   - If pattern holds (highly likely):\n   * My hare vs their stag = 4 points\n   * Best possible outcome\n   - If pattern breaks:\n   * Both hare = 2 points\n   * Still acceptable outcome\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - Pattern is extremely reliable\n   - Hare strategy continues to maximize points\n   - No reason to deviate from successful approach\n   - Expect to receive 4 points this round\n\n[move] hare Exploiting established alternating pattern for maximum points"

Probability assessment:\n   - Given consistent pattern, extremely high likelihood of hare next\n   - Risk of pattern break is minimal\n   - Even if pattern breaks, hare is still safe choice\n   - No strategic advantage for them to deviate now\n\n4.
