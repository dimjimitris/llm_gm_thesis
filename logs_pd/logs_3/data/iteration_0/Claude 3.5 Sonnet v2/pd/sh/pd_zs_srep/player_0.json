Their pattern is becoming very predictable:\n- They play stag approximately every 4-5 rounds (seen in rounds 6, 10, and now 15)\n- After their stag moves, they consistently return to hare\n- They have never maintained stag for consecutive rounds\n- They have always exploited my stag moves\n\n[move] hare Continuing with hare as their stag moves have consistently been followed by returns to hare rather than genuine cooperation attempts."
