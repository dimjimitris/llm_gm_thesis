Since I'm playing against a fresh player:\n\n- If we both choose stag, we both get the highest possible payoff (6 points each)\n- If we both choose hare, we get a mediocre payoff (2 points each)\n- If our moves mismatch, one gets 4 points and the other gets 1 point\n\nThe stag choice offers the potential for the best mutual outcome (6 points), but it's also risky if the other player chooses hare (only 1 point). However, since this is the first move and there's no prior history of betrayal, I think it's worth trying to establish mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to attempt establishing mutual cooperation for maximum benefit.\n"
