Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Stag-Stag (6,6): Best collaborative outcome\n- Hare-Hare (2,2): Safe but suboptimal outcome\n- Stag-Hare (1,4): Worst outcome for stag chooser\n- Hare-Stag (4,1): Best individual outcome but risky\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at the payoffs:\n- Choosing stag has higher potential reward (6) but also higher risk (could get only 1)\n- Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and possible 4 points\n- Against a fresh player, we need to consider their likely risk appetite\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is a fresh player:\n- They might be cautious and go for the safer hare option\n- However, they might also be optimistic and aim for maximum points with stag\n- The first move often sets the tone for future interactions\n- I suggest showing cooperative intent to establish mutual trust\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While hare is the risk-minimizing choice, stag offers the best mutual outcome. Against a fresh player, showing cooperative intent by choosing stag could lead to better long-term results.\n\nRisk Analyst: The potential benefit (6 points) outweighs the risk (1 point) in this case, especially since we're setting the tone for future interactions.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our discussion, I'll choose stag to signal cooperative intent and aim for the optimal mutual outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperative intent and encourage mutual benefit.\n"

Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.
