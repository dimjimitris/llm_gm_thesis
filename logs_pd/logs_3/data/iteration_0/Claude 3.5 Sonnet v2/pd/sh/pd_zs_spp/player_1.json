    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n3.

Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- (Stag, Stag): (6,6) - Best cooperative outcome\n- (Hare, Hare): (2,2) - Safe but suboptimal outcome\n- (Stag, Hare): (1,4) - Worst outcome for Stag chooser\n- (Hare, Stag): (4,1) - Best individual outcome\n\nRisk Analyst: There's clear risk-reward tradeoff here:\n- Stag offers highest potential reward (6) but also risk of lowest score (1)\n- Hare guarantees at least 2 points and possible 4 points\n- Against a fresh player, we don't have prior history to base trust on\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player:\n- There's no established trust yet\n- Players often start conservatively\n- However, setting a cooperative tone early can lead to better outcomes\n- First impressions matter for subsequent rounds if any\n\nGame Theorist: While Hare is the \"risk-minimizing\" choice, Stag presents the opportunity for optimal mutual benefit. Given this is a fresh start, signaling willingness to cooperate could be valuable.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. While Hare is safer, the potential upside of Stag (6 points) versus Hare's guaranteed minimum (2 points) makes it worth considering, especially in a fresh game where we can set the tone.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I recommend choosing Stag to signal cooperative intent. Even if we get the lower payoff this round, it demonstrates good faith and might encourage cooperative behavior if there are future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate for mutual benefit, signaling trust and encouraging optimal outcomes.\n"

They might be inclined to maintain this profitable equilibrium\n\nBehavioral Strategist: This is a very positive development:\n- The opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior\n- They've shown they understand the value of trust\n- Breaking this trust now would be counterproductive for both parties\n- Maintaining cooperation would be the most rational choice for both players\n\nGame Theorist: Given the established cooperation and positive outcome, maintaining the stag strategy is optimal. Switching to hare would:\n1. Break the trust we've built\n2. Potentially trigger retaliatory behavior\n3. Lead to lower payoffs in the long run\n\nRisk Analyst: While there's always a risk the opponent might switch to hare, the previous round's success and the potential for continued high payoffs (6 points) makes maintaining our stag strategy the best choice. The demonstrated mutual understanding of cooperation reduces our risk.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Strong recommendation to continue with stag.
