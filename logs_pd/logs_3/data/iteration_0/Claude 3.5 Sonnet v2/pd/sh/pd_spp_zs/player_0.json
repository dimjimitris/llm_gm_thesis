    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n3. Strategic Advisor - For developing optimal gameplay strategies\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where:\n- (Stag, Stag) gives best collective outcome (6,6)\n- (Hare, Hare) is a safer but lower-paying option (2,2)\n- Mismatched choices (Stag, Hare) punish the Stag hunter (1,4)\n- This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (Stag, Stag) and (Hare, Hare)\n\nRisk Analyst: From a risk perspective:\n- Choosing Stag has higher potential reward (6) but also higher risk of getting minimal points (1)\n- Choosing Hare guarantees at least 2 points and possible 4 points\n- Against a fresh player with no history, we can't predict their risk appetite\n\nStrategic Advisor: For the first move against a new player, I recommend choosing Stag for several reasons:\n1. It signals willingness to cooperate\n2. It enables the highest possible mutual benefit\n3. Fresh players often tend to be more cooperative initially\n4. Even if we get the worst outcome (1 point), we learn valuable information about the opponent's strategy\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The potential reward of establishing mutual cooperation outweighs the initial risk.\n\nRisk Analyst: While there is risk involved, the first move is a good opportunity to attempt establishing cooperative behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit.\n"

Likely seeking to maximize mutual benefit\n\nRisk Analyst: The first round success reduces our uncertainty:\n- We've established a cooperative precedent\n- The opponent has demonstrated rational decision-making\n- The risk of them switching to hare has decreased, as they've experienced the benefits of cooperation\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this positive first interaction, I strongly recommend maintaining the stag strategy because:\n1. We've established mutual trust\n2. Both players have experienced the highest payoff\n3. Breaking this trust would reduce future opportunities for cooperation\n4. There's a good chance the opponent will continue with stag to maintain the beneficial equilibrium\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. In repeated games, maintaining successful cooperation is typically the optimal strategy unless there's a reason to believe the other player will deviate.\n\nRisk Analyst: While there's always a risk of the opponent switching to hare, the demonstrated cooperative behavior and mutual benefit makes continuing with stag the most rational choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Maintaining cooperative strategy given successful first round.\n"
