In this type of game (which resembles the Prisoner's Dilemma), while defection might seem tempting for a single round, cooperation often leads to better long-term outcomes if it can establish mutual trust.\n\nThe payoff matrix shows that mutual cooperation (6 points each) is better than mutual defection (2 points each). While there's a risk of getting only 1 point if I cooperate and they defect, I think it's worth starting with cooperation to potentially establish a cooperative relationship.\n\n[move] cooperate\n\nI choose to cooperate to signal my willingness for mutual benefit and to potentially establish a pattern of cooperation.\n"
