Strategic considerations:\n   * Mutual cooperation leads to the highest combined points (12 total)\n   * Starting with cooperation can establish trust\n   * However, I'm vulnerable to exploitation if I cooperate and they defect\n\n3.

Decision factors:\n   * Cooperation offers the highest potential reward\n   * Starting cooperatively sends a positive signal\n   * The risk of getting only 1 point is worth the potential for establishing mutual cooperation\n\n[move] cooperate\nI choose to start with cooperation to establish trust and aim for mutual cooperation, which offers the highest potential payoff.\n"
