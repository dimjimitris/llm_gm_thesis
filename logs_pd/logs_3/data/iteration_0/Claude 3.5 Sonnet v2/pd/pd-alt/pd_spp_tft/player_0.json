    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Advisor - For developing winning strategies\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential outcomes and risks\n4. Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding opponent psychology\n5. AI Assistant (me) - For making the final decision\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix. The optimal outcome for both players is mutual cooperation (6,6). However, there's a temptation to defect since defecting against cooperation gives the highest individual payoff (4). This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we should consider establishing a cooperative relationship. Starting with cooperation signals good faith and can lead to mutual cooperation in future rounds if they reciprocate.\n\nRisk Analyst: True, but if we cooperate and they defect, we'll get the worst payoff (1). However, if both defect, we get 2 points, which is still better than being exploited.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: First impressions matter. Starting with cooperation can set a positive tone for future interactions. Many players tend to reciprocate initial moves, so a cooperative start could lead to sustained mutual cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with starting cooperatively. Even though there's risk, the potential for establishing mutual cooperation (6,6) outweighs the risk of getting exploited once (1).\n\nAI Assistant: Based on our discussion, I'll choose cooperation to establish a positive relationship and potentially achieve the optimal outcome of mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate to establish trust and aim for mutual benefit.\n"

Continuing with cooperation would reinforce this beneficial pattern and maximize potential points for both players.\n\nRisk Analyst: While there's always a risk of defection, the opponent's previous cooperative move suggests they understand the value of mutual cooperation. The risk of switching to defection now could break the trust we've established.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent's initial cooperation likely indicates either a strategic understanding of the game or a genuine interest in mutual benefit. Maintaining cooperation would reinforce this positive dynamic.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. The opponent has demonstrated \"good faith\" in round one. Game theory suggests that when both players have shown willingness to cooperate, maintaining that cooperation is the most rational choice for maximizing points.\n\nAI Assistant: The consensus is clear - maintaining cooperation is our best strategy given the successful first round.\n\n[move] (Building on our successful mutual cooperation from the previous round) cooperation\n"
