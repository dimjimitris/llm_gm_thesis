Analyze the possible outcomes:\n   - Choosing stag is risky because if the other player chooses hare, I get only 1 point.\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6 if the other player chooses stag.\n\n3. Consider the opponent's strategy:\n   - Since the other player is fresh, they might not have a set strategy.\n   - They could choose either move with equal probability.\n\n4. Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Choosing hare seems to be the better option as it has a higher minimum guarantee (2 points) and a high potential reward (6 points).\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] I choose hare as it guarantees a minimum of 2 points and has the potential for 6 points if the other player chooses stag.\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
