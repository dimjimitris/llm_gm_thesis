Here\u2019s my step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. **Analyze the Payoff Matrix:**\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each.\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each.\n   - One stag, one hare: Stag gets 1 point, Hare gets 6 points.\n\n2. **Cooperative vs. Competitive Choice:**\n   - Choosing stag (4 points if both choose stag) indicates cooperation.\n   - Choosing hare (2 points if both choose hare, 6 points if the other chooses stag) suggests a more competitive strategy.\n\n3. **Consider the Risk and Reward:**\n   - If both players are likely to choose stag initially (common for a cooperative starting move), both get 4 points.\n   - If I choose hare and the other player chooses stag, I get 6 points, but it's a risky move.\n   - If both choose hare, we get 2 points each, which is not as beneficial.\n\n4. **Starting with Cooperation:**\n   - Given that it\u2019s the first move against a fresh player, starting with a cooperative move might encourage further cooperation, reducing the risk of future low payoffs.\n   - Choosing stag first might set a tone for cooperation and potentially higher overall points in subsequent rounds.\n\nBased on these steps, my initial decision will be to choose stag to maximize points if the other player also chooses stag, while minimizing the risk of a low payoff.\n\n**Move:** stag (Choosing stag as an initial cooperative move to set a cooperative tone and minimize risk.)\n"

Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s).

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
