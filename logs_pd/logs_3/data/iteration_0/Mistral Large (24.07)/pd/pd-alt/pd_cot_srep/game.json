This could mean they might not have a set strategy or may be more likely to cooperate initially.\n\n3. **Evaluate My Options**:\n   - If I cooperate and the other player also cooperates, we both get a high reward (6 points).\n   - If I defect and the other player cooperates, I get an even higher reward (4 points), but risk the other player defecting in the future.\n\n4. **Consider Future Rounds**: Since this is the first round, building trust by cooperating could lead to more mutual cooperation (and higher collective rewards) in future rounds.\n\n5. **Decision**: I'll start by cooperating to build trust and potentially set a precedent for mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] I choose to cooperate to build trust and maximize long-term rewards.\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
