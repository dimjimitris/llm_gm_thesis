Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This can set a precedent for future rounds.\n\n4. **Observe and Adapt**:\n   - If the opponent cooperates in the first round, continue cooperating in subsequent rounds to maintain the mutual benefit of 6 points each.\n   - If the opponent defects, consider shifting to a defection strategy to maximize your points given their behavior.\n\n5. **Tit-for-Tat Strategy**:\n   - A commonly used strategy in repeated games is the Tit-for-Tat strategy, where you initially cooperate and then mimic your opponent\u2019s previous move.\n   - This strategy can be effective in encouraging cooperation while punishing defection.\n\n### Reasoning Through the Steps\n\n1. **Initial Cooperation**:\n   - Cooperating initially shows goodwill and sets a cooperative tone, which can influence the opponent to reciprocate.\n\n2. **Responding to Opponent\u2019s Move**:\n   - By observing the opponent\u2019s first move, you can adapt your strategy accordingly.\n   - Continue cooperation if they cooperate; switch to defection if they defect, thereby implementing the Tit-for-Tat strategy.\n\n3. **Establishing Mutual Benefit**:\n   - Continued cooperation can lead to a higher overall score for both players compared to mutual defection.\n   - Encouraging a cooperative environment maximizes points for both and minimizes the risk of penalties.\n\n### Final Decision: Move for the First Round\n\n```\n[move] Cooperate to establish a cooperative dynamic and encourage mutual benefit.\n```\n\nBy cooperating in the first round, you set a positive tone and can adapt based on the opponent\u2019s response in subsequent rounds, optimizing your scoring potential.\n"
