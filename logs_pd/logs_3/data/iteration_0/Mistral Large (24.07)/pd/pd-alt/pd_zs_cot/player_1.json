    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here are the steps to help make a decision:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix:**\n   - If both cooperate: both get 6 points.\n   - If both defect: both get 2 points.\n   - If I cooperate and the other defects: I get 1 point, the other gets 4 points.\n   - If I defect and the other cooperates: I get 4 points, the other gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Analyze the Consequences of Each Move:**\n   - Cooperation leads to a more balanced outcome with potential for a higher mutual benefit (6 points each).\n   - Defection can lead to a higher immediate gain for me (4 points if the other cooperates), but risks a very low gain if the other also defects (2 points each).\n\n3. **Consider the Behavior of the Other Player:**\n   - Since the other player is \"fresh,\" it's unclear what their strategy will be. They might cooperate or defect without a clear pattern.\n\n4. **Evaluate Long-Term Strategy:**\n   - In ongoing games, a tit-for-tat strategy can be effective, where you start by cooperating and then mimic the previous move of the other player.\n   - Since this is the first round, a cooperative move can set a positive tone and potentially lead to mutual cooperation in future rounds.\n\n5. **Make a Decision:**\n   - Given the benefits of mutual cooperation and the unpredictable nature of the other player, it might be strategically beneficial to start with cooperation.\n\nFinal Decision:\n[move] I choose cooperation to potentially set a cooperative tone and maximize mutual benefits.\n"
