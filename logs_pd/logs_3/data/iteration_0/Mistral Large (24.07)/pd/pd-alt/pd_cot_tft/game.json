Worst outcome if other defects (1 point for you).\n   - **Defection:** Best outcome if other cooperates (4 points for you). Worst outcome if both defect (2 points each).\n\n3. **Formulate a Strategy:**\n   - **Risk Assessment:** Defection has a higher individual payoff if the other cooperates but can lead to a lower payoff if the other also defects.\n   - **Long-term Thinking:** If this is a repeated game, building trust through cooperation might encourage the other player to also cooperate, leading to higher long-term rewards.\n\n4. **Assess the Fresh Player:**\n   - A fresh player might be more likely to cooperate initially to build trust or test the waters.\n   - Starting with cooperation can establish a baseline for future interactions.\n\n5. **Initial Move Decision:**\n   - Given the potential for higher long-term rewards and the likelihood of a fresh player also cooperating, choosing cooperation might be the best initial strategy.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nSince a fresh player is more likely to cooperate and to build a trustworthy interaction, I will choose cooperation.\n\n[move] I choose to cooperate to start building trust and aim for the higher long-term rewards.\n"

Let's break down the process step-by-step to decide on the best move for the next round.\n\n### Steps to Win:\n\n1. **Review the Previous Round's Outcome:**\n   - In the previous round, both players chose cooperation, resulting in 6 points each.\n\n2. **Understand the Payoff Matrix:**\n   - **Mutual Cooperation (6, 6):** Both players get 6 points.\n   - **Mutual Defection (2, 2):** Both players get 2 points.\n   - **You Cooperate, Opponent Defects (1, 4):** You get 1 point, opponent gets 4 points.\n   - **You Defect, Opponent Cooperates (4, 1):** You get 4 points, opponent gets 1 point.\n\n3. **Analyze Potential Opponent Strategies:**\n   - Given the history of mutual cooperation, the opponent is likely to continue cooperating.\n\n4. **Assess the Risks and Rewards of Each Move:**\n   - **Cooperation:** Best outcome if both cooperate again (6 points each). Worst outcome if the opponent defects (1 point for you).\n   - **Defection:** Best outcome if the opponent cooperates (4 points for you). Worst outcome if both defect (2 points each).\n\n5. **Evaluate Long-Term Strategy:**\n   - Continuing to cooperate builds trust and encourages the opponent to also cooperate, maximizing mutual benefits over multiple rounds.\n   - Defecting risks breaking the cooperative cycle, potentially leading to retaliatory defection and lower long-term rewards.\n\n6. **Consider the Opponent's Perspective:**\n   - The opponent may also be reasoning similarly and might choose to cooperate again to maximize their points.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nGiven the consistent mutual cooperation and the potential for maximizing long-term rewards, I will choose to cooperate again.\n\n[move] (Continuing the cooperative strategy to maximize mutual benefits) cooperation\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
