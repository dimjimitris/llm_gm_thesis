However, assuming the player might also be trying to maximize points, they could be inclined to choose Stag for the higher reward despite the risk.\n\n4. **Decide on the Move**: Given the analysis, choosing Stag could maximize points if the opponent also chooses Stag, but it's risky. Choosing Hare is safer and could yield a good reward if the opponent chooses Stag.\n\nConsidering the fresh player and the payoff matrix, I'll choose Hare to maximize the minimum gain.\n\n[move] Choosing Hare to ensure a decent outcome while considering the risk of the opponent's unknown strategy.\n"
