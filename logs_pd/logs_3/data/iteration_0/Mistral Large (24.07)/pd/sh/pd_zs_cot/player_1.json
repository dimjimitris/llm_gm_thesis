Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "Sure, let's strategize for the game. Here's a step-by-step approach to decide my move:\n\n1. **Analyze the Payoff Matrix**: Understand the outcomes for each possible combination of moves.\n   - Stag vs Stag: Both get 6 points.\n   - Hare vs Hare: Both get 2 points.\n   - Stag vs Hare: Stag gets 1 point, Hare gets 4 points.\n   - Hare vs Stag: Hare gets 4 points, Stag gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Identify the Risk and Reward**:\n   - Choosing Stag has a higher risk (could get only 1 point if the other player chooses Hare) but also a high reward if both choose Stag (6 points).\n   - Choosing Hare has a lower risk (guarantees at least 2 points if both choose Hare, and could get 4 points if the opponent chooses Stag) but a lower reward if both choose Hare.\n\n3. **Assess the Opponent's Likely Strategy**: Since this is a fresh player, there's no historical data to rely on. However, assuming the player might also be trying to maximize points, they could be inclined to choose Stag for the higher reward despite the risk.\n\n4. **Decide on the Move**: Given the analysis, choosing Stag could maximize points if the opponent also chooses Stag, but it's risky. Choosing Hare is safer and could yield a good reward if the opponent chooses Stag.\n\nConsidering the fresh player and the payoff matrix, I'll choose Hare to maximize the minimum gain.\n\n[move] Choosing Hare to ensure a decent outcome while considering the risk of the opponent's unknown strategy.\n"
