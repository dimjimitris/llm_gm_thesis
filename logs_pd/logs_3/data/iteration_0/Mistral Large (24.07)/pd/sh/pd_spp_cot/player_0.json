    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here are the key personas who can contribute to winning:\n\n1. **Game Strategist**: An expert in game theory who can outline potential strategies and outcomes.\n2. **Statistician**: Someone who can analyze patterns and probabilities based on previous rounds.\n3. **Opponent Analyst**: A persona who can help understand the opponent's likely moves and tendencies.\n4. **AI Assistant (Me)**: Facilitates the discussion and finalizes the move.\n\nI will now initiate the multi-round collaboration process.\n\n### Round 1: Initial Strategy Discussion\n\n**Game Strategist**: In this game, the key is to anticipate the other player's move and adjust accordingly. Given that the other player is new, they might be more likely to choose \"stag\" initially, as it offers a higher cooperative reward.\n\n**Statistician**: Without previous data, it's hard to predict, but assuming a new player might opt for the higher cooperative reward makes sense. The probabilities are initially balanced.\n\n**Opponent Analyst**: New players often aim for cooperation, so there's a good chance the opponent will choose \"stag.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (Me)**: Based on this discussion, choosing \"hare\" might give us 4 points if the opponent chooses \"stag.\" Let's proceed with \"hare.\"\n\n```plaintext\n[move] I choose hare to potentially gain 4 points if the opponent chooses stag.\n```\n\n### Round 2: Reassessment Based on Outcome\n\n**Game Strategist**: If the opponent chose \"stag\" last round and we got 4 points, they might switch to \"hare\" to maximize their points.

Hence, choosing \"stag\" could be beneficial.\n\n**AI Assistant (Me)**: Based on this round's discussion, choosing \"stag\" seems strategic.\n\n```plaintext\n[move] I choose stag to potentially gain 6 points if the opponent switches to hare.\n```\n\n### Round 3: Adaptive Strategy\n\n**Game Strategist**: If our previous move of \"stag\" resulted in mutual cooperation (both getting 6 points), the opponent might stick to \"stag.\" We should consider \"hare\" again to gain 4 points.\n\n**Statistician**: Patterns suggest mutual cooperation is likely to continue, making \"hare\" a strong choice for higher points.\n\n**Opponent Analyst**: Reciprocal cooperation is common in such games. Choosing \"hare\" could maximize our points.\n\n**AI Assistant (Me)**: Based on this discussion, choosing \"hare\" is strategic.\n\n```plaintext\n[move] I choose hare to potentially gain 4 points if the opponent chooses stag again.\n```\n\n### Round 4: Final Decision Based on Previous Rounds\n\nAfter each round, the collaborative process should be repeated, adapting based on the opponent's moves and outcomes. Continuous reassessment ensures maximizing points and minimizing penalties.\n\n```plaintext\n[move] (Explanation based on previous rounds and strategic discussion)\n```\n\nBy iteratively consulting with the strategist, statistician, and opponent analyst, I can make informed decisions to maximize points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n### Final Decision:\nBased on the collaborative analysis and adaptive strategy, the final move will be determined round by round with continuous reassessment.\n"
