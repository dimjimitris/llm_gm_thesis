If the opponent also switches to cooperation, both players could receive 4 points each.\n   - However, cooperating carries the risk that the opponent will continue to defect, resulting in another low score for me.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**:\n   - The risk of cooperating while the opponent defects is receiving only 1 point. However, this risk could be mitigated by the potential for establishing a cooperative trend in future rounds.\n   - Defecting ensures a steady, albeit low, score of 2 points but does not encourage a cooperative dynamic.\n\n6. **Long-Term Strategy**:\n   - Switching to cooperation could signal a willingness to return to a mutually beneficial strategy. If the opponent also cooperates, this could set a new pattern of high rewards for both players.\n   - If the opponent continues to defect, defecting in future rounds can always be an option to prevent exploitation.\n\nBased on these considerations, the best move to maximize points in the long term and potentially encourage mutual cooperation is to cooperate.\n\n[move] (Encouraging mutual cooperation to maximize long-term points) cooperation\n"
