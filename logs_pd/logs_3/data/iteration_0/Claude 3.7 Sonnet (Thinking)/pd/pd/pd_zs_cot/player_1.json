Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking purely at individual round outcomes, defection always gives me more points than cooperation regardless of what they choose.\n\n4. However, if this is a multi-round game, establishing cooperation early could lead to mutual cooperation and higher total points over time.\n\n5. In repeated games like this, starting with cooperation often signals willingness to work together for mutual benefit.\n\n6.

This consistent pattern represents an ideal outcome in this type of strategic interaction.\n\nThe other player has maintained unwavering cooperation throughout our entire interaction, establishing a relationship defined by perfect reliability and mutual trust. Their consistent behavior strongly indicates a sophisticated understanding of optimal strategy in repeated games.\n\nAnalyzing my options for this round:\n- Continuing cooperation maintains our stable pattern of earning 4 points per round\n- Defecting might yield a one-time gain of 6 points but would disrupt our established trust\n- If defection triggered mutual defection in future rounds, we'd each earn only 2 points per round\n- The mathematical expectation clearly favors continued cooperation\n\nThe principles of game theory for repeated interactions strongly support maintaining our cooperative relationship, as the long-term benefits of sustained cooperation outweigh any short-term gain from defection.\n\n[move] (Maintaining our optimal cooperative relationship) cooperation"
