However, if we both adopt this strategy, we'll both get 2 points instead of the potential 4 points each.\n\n5. Since this is a fresh opponent and possibly a repeated game, starting with cooperation might establish mutual cooperation for higher long-term gains.\n\n6.

While defecting now might yield me 6 points if they cooperate again, this could trigger defection from them in future rounds, resulting in lower points overall.\n\n7.
