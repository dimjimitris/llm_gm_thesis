They cooperated in rounds 7, 9, 10, and 12 when I defected, but defected in round 11 when I defected. \n\nLooking at the most recent moves:\n- Round 11: We both defected\n- Round 12: I defected, they cooperated\n\nThis suggests my opponent might have been trying to reset to cooperation after a period of mutual defection. They could be using a more complex strategy than simple tit-for-tat, or they might be trying different approaches to see what works.\n\nGiven their cooperation in the last round, I have two options:\n1. Continue defecting - This would yield 4 points if they cooperate again, but only 2 points if they defect.\n2. Switch to cooperation - This would yield 6 points if they also cooperate, but only 1 point if they defect.\n\nThe safest option based on recent history would be to continue defecting, as my opponent has shown a tendency to cooperate after my defection. However, if I want to potentially establish mutual cooperation again (which gives the highest sustained points), I could switch to cooperation as a signal.\n\nLet me consider the longer trend. My opponent did maintain cooperation for three rounds (3-5) earlier in the game, which suggests they may be willing to engage in mutual cooperation. However, they've been somewhat unpredictable since then.\n\nI think I'll continue with defection for now, as it has generally yielded better results against this particular opponent. If they cooperate again after this, I might consider switching to cooperation in a future round to test their willingness for mutual cooperation.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
