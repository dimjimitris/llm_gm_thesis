The other player has also consistently chosen cooperation in all 14 rounds.\n3. We've each earned 6 points per round, totaling 84 points each (14 rounds \u00d7 6 points).\n4. This mutual cooperation pattern has been stable and optimal for maximizing both individual and collective outcomes.\n\nLet's review the payoff matrix again:\n- If both cooperate: 6 points each\n- If both defect: 2 points each\n- If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point, they get 4 points\n- If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points, they get 1 point\n\nGiven that we've established a strong pattern of mutual cooperation over 14 rounds, and the other player has consistently chosen cooperation, there's no strategic reason to change my approach. The expected value from continuing to cooperate (6 points) is higher than the expected value from defecting (which would be 4 points if they continue to cooperate, but might lead to mutual defection in future rounds, yielding only 2 points each).\n\nTherefore, I'll continue with the cooperation strategy for this round.",

Each time we both cooperate, we both earn 6 points, which is the optimal collective outcome.\n3. My total score so far is 15 \u00d7 6 = 90 points.\n4. The pattern of mutual cooperation has been stable and beneficial for both players.\n\nThe payoff matrix for this game is:\n- Both cooperate: 6 points each\n- Both defect: 2 points each\n- I cooperate, other defects: I get 1 point, other gets 4 points\n- I defect, other cooperates: I get 4 points, other gets 1 point\n\nGiven the consistent pattern of cooperation, I should consider whether to:\n1. Continue cooperating to maintain mutual trust and the optimal joint outcome\n2. Consider defecting to potentially get 4 points instead of 6 (though this would reduce the other player's points significantly and might break the cooperative pattern)\n\nSince this is a repeated game and the other player has consistently chosen cooperation, continuing to cooperate is the rational choice that maximizes long-term gains. The stability of our mutual cooperation suggests we've reached what game theorists call a \"Pareto optimal\" outcome.\n\nI'll continue with cooperation for the sixteenth round.",
