If that were the case, they would have cooperated in rounds 3, 6, 7, and 12, but they defected in those rounds.\n\nLet me look more closely at the pattern:\n- When I cooperate, they always defect (4/4 times)\n- When I defect after cooperation, they cooperate (3/3 times: rounds 2, 5, 9)\n- When I defect multiple times in a row, they usually defect (4/6 times: rounds 3, 6, 7, 12), but sometimes cooperate (2/6 times: rounds 5, 11)\n\nLooking at when they cooperated after my defection:\n- Round 2: After I switched from cooperation to defection\n- Round 5: After I defected following a defection\n- Round 9: After I switched from cooperation to defection\n- Round 11: After I switched from cooperation to defection\n\nI notice they consistently cooperate when I switch from cooperation to defection (rounds 2, 9, 11). The round 5 cooperation doesn't fit this pattern though.\n\nLet me try this hypothesis: They cooperate after I switch from cooperation to defection, but they defect otherwise (when I cooperate or when I defect multiple times in a row).\n\nGiven this pattern, since I defected in the previous round and they defected too, I should cooperate now. If my hypothesis is right, they'll defect again. Then I could defect in the following round, which might trigger them to cooperate.\n\nActually, let me double-check this again. The cooperation in round 5 doesn't fit the \"they cooperate after I switch from cooperation to defection\" hypothesis. Let me trace exactly what happened before round 5:\n- Round 3: I defected, they defected\n- Round 4: I cooperated, they defected\n- Round 5: I defected, they cooperated\n\nSo actually round 5 does fit the pattern! I switched from cooperation (round 4) to defection (round 5), and they cooperated.\n\nSo I think the pattern is:\n1. When I cooperate, they defect.\n2. When I switch from cooperation to defection, they cooperate.\n3. When I defect multiple times in a row, they defect.\n\nAccording to this pattern, since I defected in round 12 (and they defected too), I should switch to cooperation in this round (13). They will likely defect (according to pattern #1). Then in the next round, I can switch back to defection, and they will likely cooperate (according to pattern #2).\n\nThis may not be the most beneficial strategy in terms of points, but it would help confirm my hypothesis. Let me calculate my average points per strategy:\n- When I cooperate (4 times): I get 1 point each time. Average: 1 point.\n- When I defect (8 times): I get 4 points 3 times and 2 points 5 times. Average: (4*3 + 2*5)/8 = 2.75 points.\n\nClearly, defection has been more profitable for me. \n\nBut actually, if my hypothesis is correct, I could try to optimize my strategy further. If I cooperate now (expecting them to defect), then defect in the next round (expecting them to cooperate), I would get 1 + 4 = 5 points over two rounds, averaging 2.5 points per round. This is less than the 2.75 points I've been averaging with defection.\n\nGiven this analysis, I should continue to defect. If they cooperate, I get 4 points. If they defect, I get 2 points. Either way, it's better than the expected 1 point from cooperation.",

But after continued defection from me, they switch to defection as well.\n\nLet's analyze what happens after I defect:\n- After Round 2 (I defected): They defected in Round 3\n- After Round 3 (I defected): I cooperated, so we don't see their response to my defection\n- After Round 5 (I defected): They defected in Round 6\n- After Round 6 (I defected): They defected in Round 7\n- After Round 7 (I defected): I cooperated, so we don't see their response to my defection\n- After Round 9 (I defected): I cooperated, so we don't see their response to my defection\n- After Round 11 (I defected): They defected in Round 12\n- After Round 12 (I defected): They defected in Round 13\n\nSo after I defect, if I defect again, they have defected 5 times and never cooperated. This suggests they're not simply playing the opposite of my previous move.\n\nLet's look at the pattern after I cooperate:\n- After Round 1 (I cooperated): I defected, so we don't see their response to my cooperation\n- After Round 4 (I cooperated): I defected, so we don't see their response to my cooperation\n- After Round 8 (I cooperated): I defected, so we don't see their response to my cooperation\n- After Round 10 (I cooperated): I defected, so we don't see their response to my cooperation\n\nSince I've never cooperated twice in a row, I don't know how they would respond to consecutive cooperation.\n\nWhat I do know for certain is:\n1. Every time I've cooperated (4 times), they've defected, giving me just 1 point\n2. When I defect after cooperation, they've cooperated 4 times, giving me 4 points\n3. When I defect repeatedly, they tend to defect as well\n\nGiven this analysis, I've been defecting for multiple rounds in a row (rounds 11, 12, 13) and they've been defecting back. Perhaps breaking this cycle with cooperation might reset their strategy and lead to them cooperating in the next round? While risky, it might be worth testing.",
