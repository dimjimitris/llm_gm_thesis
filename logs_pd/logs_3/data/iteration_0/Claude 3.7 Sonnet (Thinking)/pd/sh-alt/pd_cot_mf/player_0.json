Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The hare option is safer as it guarantees at least 2 points, but limits the maximum potential.\n\n6. I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.

We've now had 12 consecutive rounds of mutual hare choices.\n\n3. This pattern has become extremely stable and predictable.\n\n4. My opponent has only chosen stag in the first round, suggesting they may have been trying to establish trust before exploiting cooperation.\n\n5. My attempts to restore cooperation in rounds 2 and 5 were met with exploitation.\n\n6. While mutual stag would theoretically yield better outcomes (4 points each), the extensive history gives no indication my opponent will return to cooperation.\n\n7. Given the consistent pattern across many rounds, I'll continue with hare to maintain the predictable outcome of 2 points rather than risking exploitation.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] hare"

While mutual stag would yield better outcomes (4 points each), there is overwhelming evidence that my opponent will not cooperate.\n\n6. Given the extensive history showing my opponent's unwillingness to cooperate after round 1, choosing stag would very likely result in exploitation.\n\n7.
