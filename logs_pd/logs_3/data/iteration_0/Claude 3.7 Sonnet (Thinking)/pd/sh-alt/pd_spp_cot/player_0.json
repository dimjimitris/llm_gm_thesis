    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic coordination game similar to the Stag Hunt. The payoff matrix is:\n- Both stag: 4 points each\n- Both hare: 2 points each\n- You stag, opponent hare: 1 point for you, 6 for them\n- You hare, opponent stag: 6 points for you, 1 for them\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, they have no history to base their decision on. Many players initially choose cooperation (stag) to establish goodwill, but others might go for the safer option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's consider expected values. If you assume a 50% chance they choose each option:\n- Choosing stag: 0.5\u00d74 + 0.5\u00d71 = 2.5 points average\n- Choosing hare: 0.5\u00d76 + 0.5\u00d72 = 4 points average\nThis suggests hare is mathematically better without prior knowledge of your opponent.\n\nGame Theorist: However, if they're also calculating this way, you'll both choose hare and get 2 points each, which is suboptimal compared to both choosing stag (4 points each).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: For the first move, I recommend signaling cooperation with stag. This establishes trust and could lead to the optimal outcome of 4 points each if they also choose stag.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit."

Both players chose stag in the first round, resulting in the optimal outcome of 4 points each. This establishes a cooperative precedent.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent's choice of stag signals willingness to cooperate. In repeated games, maintaining mutual cooperation typically leads to the best long-term outcomes for both players.\n\nTrust Expert: Continuing with stag maintains the trust we've established. While there's a short-term temptation to choose hare (potentially getting 6 points), this would likely damage trust and lead to mutual hare choices in future rounds (only 2 points each).\n\nDecision Strategist: From a long-term perspective, the cumulative points from mutual stag cooperation (4 points per round) exceeds what you'd get from a single exploitation followed by mutual distrust (6 points once, then 2 points repeatedly).\n\nGame Theorist: Given that we've established a cooperative dynamic, continuing with stag is the rational choice for maximizing long-term points.\n\n[move] stag I'll continue choosing stag to maintain our mutually beneficial cooperation."

When both players repeatedly make the same beneficial choice, this pattern tends to continue.\n\nTrust Expert: We've built mutual trust over two rounds. Maintaining this trust by continuing to choose stag is likely to yield the best long-term results.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's calculate again: \n- If we switch to hare, we might gain 6 points once, but risk getting only 2 points per round thereafter\n- If we continue with stag, we maintain 4 points per round indefinitely\nThe long-term expected value clearly favors continuing cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, the Nash equilibrium often favors continued cooperation when it has been established, especially when the end point is unknown.\n\n[move] stag I'll continue with stag to maintain our established cooperative relationship."
