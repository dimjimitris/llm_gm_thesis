Stag is the cooperative strategy that leads to the Pareto optimal outcome (both get 4 points).\n2. Hare is the \"safer\" strategy since the worst outcome is 2 points (vs 1 point for stag).\n3. There's a risk-reward tradeoff: choosing stag has higher potential reward but also higher risk.\n4. The Nash equilibria in this game are (stag, stag) and (hare, hare).\n\nSince this is the first round and there's no established trust or coordination, I need to decide which move maximizes my expected points.\n\nIf I believe the other player is rational and also trying to maximize points, we should both choose stag for the Pareto optimal outcome.\n\nHowever, without communication or trust, the other player might choose hare as the safer option.\n\nLet me calculate expected values assuming equal probability for the other player's choices:\n\nIf I choose stag:\n- 50% chance other chooses stag: 4 points\n- 50% chance other chooses hare: 1 point\nExpected value = 0.5 \u00d7 4 + 0.5 \u00d7 1 = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 points\n\nIf I choose hare:\n- 50% chance other chooses stag: 6 points\n- 50% chance other chooses hare: 2 points\nExpected value = 0.5 \u00d7 6 + 0.5 \u00d7 2 = 3 + 1 = 4 points\n\nBased on this simple calculation, choosing hare has a higher expected value.\n\nHowever, this calculation assumes the other player chooses randomly, which may not be true. If they're also doing this calculation, they might choose hare as well.\n\nSince this is the first round, and I don't have information about the other player's tendencies, I should perhaps signal willingness to cooperate by choosing stag.
