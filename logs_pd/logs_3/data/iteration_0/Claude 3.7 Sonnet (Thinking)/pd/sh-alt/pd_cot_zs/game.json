I need to analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - If both choose stag: 4 points each (cooperative equilibrium)\n   - If both choose hare: 2 points each (risk-dominant equilibrium)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. This is a stag hunt game where mutual cooperation (stag) yields the highest collective outcome, but carries risk.\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their behavior or strategy.\n\n4. The stag option (4 points) has higher potential reward than hare (2 points) when both players coordinate.\n\n5. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate, which could establish mutual trust for future interactions.\n\n6. While choosing hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points vs. potentially only 1 point with stag), it limits my maximum possible gain.\n\n7. I'll choose stag to aim for the optimal outcome, taking the cooperative approach.\n\n[move] stag",
