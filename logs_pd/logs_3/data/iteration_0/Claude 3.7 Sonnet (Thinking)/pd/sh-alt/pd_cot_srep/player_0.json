    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to understand the payoff structure to make a strategic decision:\n   - Both choose stag: We both get 4 points (good mutual outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: We both get 2 points (mediocre mutual outcome)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 (I lose badly)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 (I win big)\n\n2. Evaluate my risk tolerance:\n   - Choosing stag has the highest mutual benefit but exposes me to exploitation\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and possibly 6 points\n\n3. Consider this is the first interaction with a new player:\n   - No established history of trust or patterns\n   - Setting a cooperative tone might lead to mutual benefit if we play multiple rounds\n\n4. Weigh the risk versus reward:\n   - The 4 points from mutual stag choice is better than the 2 points from mutual hare\n   - But the risk of getting only 1 point is significant\n\n5. Make a final decision based on optimism and potential for mutual gain.\n\n[move] stag"

We both got 2 points each time.\n   - Round 5: I tried stag again, opponent chose hare. I got 1 point, they got 6.\n   - Rounds 6-13: We both chose hare. We both got 2 points each time.\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's demonstrated pattern:\n   - They have chosen hare in all thirteen rounds without exception\n   - They have exploited both of my cooperative attempts\n   - There is overwhelming evidence their strategy is fixed\n\n3. Evaluate the payoff implications:\n   - Against an opponent who always plays hare, choosing hare yields 2 points\n   - Choosing stag yields only 1 point (as proven twice already)\n   - The 2 points from hare/hare is better than the 1 point from stag/hare\n\n4. Apply rational decision making:\n   - Given the opponent's consistent behavior, the expected payoff is highest with hare\n   - There is no evidence that would justify taking the risk of choosing stag\n\n5. Make the optimal decision based on thirteen rounds of consistent evidence.\n\n[move] hare"
