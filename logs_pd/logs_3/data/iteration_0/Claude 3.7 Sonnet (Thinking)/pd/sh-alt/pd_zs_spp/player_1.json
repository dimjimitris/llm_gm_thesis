    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Let me collaborate with experts to determine the best move.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Strategic Planner, Behavioral Psychologist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game with a risk-reward tradeoff. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- If both choose stag: 4 points each (Pareto optimal)\n- If both choose hare: 2 points each\n- If one chooses stag and other chooses hare: 1 point for stag chooser, 6 points for hare chooser\n\nThere are two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The stag-stag outcome is payoff dominant, but hare-hare is risk dominant.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their tendencies. We need to consider whether to prioritize maximizing potential gain or minimizing potential loss.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Fresh players often default to cooperative behavior in the first round. The stag choice signals a willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, while hare is a safer but less optimal choice. Since this is the first interaction, establishing cooperation might be beneficial for long-term payoffs.\n\nGame Theorist: True, but choosing stag carries risk. If the other player chooses hare, we get only 1 point while they get 6. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we don't know if this is a one-shot game or repeated interaction, I'd recommend starting with stag. It signals cooperative intent and offers the potential for the highest mutual outcome.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Starting with stag can establish a cooperative norm. If the opponent reciprocates, we can continue with stag for mutual benefit. If they choose hare, we can reassess our strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate for mutual benefit."

This suggests our opponent is willing to cooperate.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since the opponent chose stag in the first round, they've demonstrated cooperative behavior. In repeated games with established cooperation, maintaining that cooperation is typically optimal unless there's reason to believe the other player will defect.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This mutual cooperation establishes a positive precedent. Players tend to reciprocate previous moves in repeated games - this is known as the \"tit-for-tat\" strategy. Since they cooperated before, it's reasonable to expect continued cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: The risk of choosing hare is that it could break the cooperative pattern. If we choose hare while they continue with stag, we'd get 6 points, but this might trigger retaliation in future rounds, potentially leading to a less optimal hare-hare equilibrium (2 points each).\n\nStrategic Planner: Given that cooperation has been established and is working well, I recommend continuing with stag. The long-term expected value of sustained cooperation exceeds the short-term gain from defecting.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Maintaining trust and cooperation will likely yield better results over multiple rounds. The opponent has shown they're willing to choose the mutually beneficial option, so continuing with stag is the rational choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I'll continue with cooperation as it has proven beneficial for both players."

This pattern strongly suggests we're in a cooperative equilibrium.\n\nStrategic Planner: The consistent cooperative behavior from our opponent provides valuable information. With two rounds of stag-stag outcomes, we've established a mutually beneficial pattern. Deviating now would provide a one-time gain but could disrupt this productive equilibrium.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: People tend to develop expectations based on repeated interactions. At this point, the other player likely expects us to choose stag again. Breaking this expectation could trigger a retaliatory response in future rounds. The psychological concept of reciprocity is powerful here.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games with no defined endpoint, the cooperative strategy typically dominates as long as both players maintain cooperation. The cumulative value of multiple 4-point outcomes exceeds the short-term gain from defection.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend maintaining our strategy of choosing stag. The pattern is working well, giving us consistent optimal points, and there's no indication that our opponent plans to defect.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I concur.

This strategy is working exceptionally well. The alternative of defecting to hare might yield a one-time gain (6 points versus 4), but risks breaking a productive pattern that could continue to generate optimal results.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Three consecutive cooperative choices strongly indicate that our opponent values consistent mutual benefit. At this point, a sudden defection would likely be interpreted as a betrayal of established trust, potentially triggering a defensive or retaliatory response in subsequent rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: The longer a cooperative pattern continues, the more stable it becomes. The expected value of continued cooperation exceeds the short-term gain from defection, especially when considering possible future rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: I see no strategic reason to change our approach.

Our opponent has shown consistent commitment to the cooperative strategy across multiple rounds. Mathematically speaking, continued cooperation (4 points per round) outperforms any alternating strategy involving defection, especially when considering the risk of triggering a shift to a hare-hare equilibrium (only 2 points per round).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: With four consecutive cooperative rounds, we've established strong mutual expectations. Psychological research suggests that breaking established patterns becomes increasingly difficult as they continue - both parties come to rely on and expect the pattern to continue. The other player likely has high confidence in our continued cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory terms, we've reached what's called a \"focal point\" - a solution that players tend to converge on naturally.

After five rounds of consistent cooperation, we can have high confidence in our opponent's strategy. The expected value of continued cooperation far exceeds any potential short-term gain from defection, especially considering the risk of triggering a shift to a less optimal equilibrium in subsequent rounds.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Five consecutive cooperative choices establishes what psychologists call a \"behavioral contract\" - an unwritten but mutually understood agreement between players. Breaking this pattern now would not only be surprising to our opponent but could be perceived as a violation of trust. The consistency principle suggests that both players are now strongly committed to this pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, especially after establishing such a consistent pattern, the rational choice is to maintain cooperation as long as the other player reciprocates.

The expected value of continued cooperation remains higher than any alternative strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After six rounds, the cooperation pattern has become deeply ingrained in the interaction dynamic.

Twelve consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation demonstrate an extraordinarily reliable pattern. Both players have consistently recognized and acted on the optimal strategy for mutual benefit. The expected value of continued cooperation remains significantly higher than any alternative approach.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After twelve rounds of consistent cooperative choices, we've established what game theorists and psychologists call a \"robust cooperative norm.\" Both players have clearly signaled their understanding of and commitment to the optimal outcome. The psychological barriers to defection are extremely high at this point.\n\nGame Theorist: From a mathematical perspective, our strategy has yielded the maximum possible points (48) over these twelve rounds. Any strategy involving defection would have yielded fewer total points, especially when considering the potential cascade effect of disrupting the cooperative equilibrium.\n\nStrategic Planner: I strongly recommend maintaining our stag strategy. The data from twelve rounds provides definitive evidence that this approach maximizes our points given our opponent's consistent behavior.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I completely agree.
