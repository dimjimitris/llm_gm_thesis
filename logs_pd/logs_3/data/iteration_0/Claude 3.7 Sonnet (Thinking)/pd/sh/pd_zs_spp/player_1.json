    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The (stag, stag) outcome is Pareto-optimal with 6 points each, but it requires mutual trust. The (hare, hare) outcome is risk-dominant with 2 points each - lower reward but less risk.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no history to base decisions on. The optimal joint outcome would be both choosing stag (6 points each), but that requires cooperation. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, while choosing stag could result in only 1 point if the opponent chooses hare.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: With a new player who has no history with us, they might default to either cooperation (stag) or self-preservation (hare). Since the hint mentions a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have preconceived strategies. Many players initially tend toward cooperation in these games, making stag a reasonable first move to establish mutual cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Starting with stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. Even if we get exploited in the first round (only getting 1 point), it's a small price to pay for potentially establishing a cooperative pattern for future rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's choose stag for the first move. If the opponent also chooses stag, we both get the maximum payoff of 6 points. If they choose hare, we'll need to reconsider our strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to hunt the stag, aiming for mutual cooperation and the highest possible outcome."

This suggests the other player is willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Planner: This is positive development! The opponent appears to be a cooperator, at least initially. Since we've established a successful pattern of cooperation, the rational choice would be to continue choosing stag. Maintaining this equilibrium benefits both players maximally.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. When players experience success with cooperation, they tend to continue that pattern. The opponent has shown they understand the value of mutual cooperation. Breaking this pattern would likely lead to mutual distrust and lower payoffs for both. \n\nGame Theorist: The game theory principle of \"tit-for-tat\" - rewarding cooperation with cooperation - suggests we should continue choosing stag after a successful cooperative round. This reinforces the beneficial equilibrium we've established.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's choose stag again. This maintains our cooperative stance, signals consistency in our strategy, and aims for the highest mutual payoff. If the opponent deviates to hare in this round, we can reconsider our strategy for subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Since cooperation was successful in the first round, I'll continue with stag to maintain our mutually beneficial strategy."

At this point, the mutual trust is so firmly established that the cooperative norm has become the default expectation for both players. The consistency across so many rounds indicates both players fully understand and value the benefits of cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: Mathematically, continuing with stag remains the obvious optimal choice. We've maintained the Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium across twelve consecutive rounds, consistently delivering maximum rewards to both players. Any deviation would result in strictly worse outcomes.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's continue with stag. Our opponent has shown remarkable consistency in their cooperative strategy across twelve rounds, and maintaining this approach ensures we continue achieving the best possible outcome.
