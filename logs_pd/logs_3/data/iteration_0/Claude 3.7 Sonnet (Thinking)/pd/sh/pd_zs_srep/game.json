In this situation, I have to make a choice based on game theory principles.\n\nI could choose:\n1. Stag - Indicating willingness to cooperate for maximum mutual benefit\n2. Hare - Playing it safe to avoid the worst outcome\n\nIn the absence of communication or prior history, this is a challenging decision.
