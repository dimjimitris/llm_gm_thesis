Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (suboptimal mutual outcome)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 points (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 point (best for me individually)\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare).\n\n3. The stag-stag outcome yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each), making it the socially optimal choice.\n\n4. However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n\n5. Since this is the first round and I'm playing against a fresh player, I'll signal my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n6. Choosing stag demonstrates trust and aims for the optimal collective outcome.\n\n[move] stag"

This suggests my opponent may be playing strategically for their own benefit rather than seeking mutual optimal outcomes.\n\n3. Given this pattern, I need to adjust my strategy. If they continue choosing hare, I'd be better off also choosing hare (2 points) than stag (1 point).\n\n4. Even if they switch to stag (perhaps thinking I'll choose stag again), choosing hare would give me 4 points versus the 6 I'd get from mutual stag hunting.\n\n5. While the mutual stag choice (6 points each) is theoretically optimal, my opponent has demonstrated they're not pursuing this strategy.\n\n6.

We've now established and maintained stable mutual cooperation for twelve consecutive rounds.\n\n3. This stag-stag equilibrium has consistently delivered the maximum possible mutual benefit (6 points each).\n\n4. After initial exploration in the first two rounds, we quickly identified and locked into the optimal strategy.\n\n5. There's no strategic reason to deviate from this pattern:\n   - It would immediately reduce my points (from 6 to 4)\n   - It would break a long-established pattern of trust\n   - It would likely trigger a cycle of lower payoffs in subsequent rounds\n\n6. The principles of repeated game theory strongly favor maintaining this Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium.\n\n7. I'll continue with our proven mutual cooperation strategy.\n\n[move] stag"
