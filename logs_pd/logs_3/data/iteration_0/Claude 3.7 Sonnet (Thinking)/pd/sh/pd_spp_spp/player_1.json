    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately.

Let me collaborate with some experts to decide on my move.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Behavioral Psychologist, Risk Analyst\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game from game theory. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Both choose stag: We get 6 points (best collaborative outcome)\n- Both choose hare: We get 2 points (safe but suboptimal)\n- We choose stag, they choose hare: We get 1 point (worst outcome for us)\n- We choose hare, they choose stag: We get 4 points (exploitative outcome)\n\nThe game has two Nash equilibria: both players choosing stag, or both players choosing hare. The stag-stag outcome is Pareto optimal.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: In first-time interactions with no prior history, people tend to vary in their approach. Some may choose cooperation (stag) hoping for mutual benefit, while others may choose the safer option (hare) to avoid the worst-case scenario. Since this is a fresh player, we don't have data on their tendencies.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the risk-reward tradeoff. Choosing stag has higher potential reward (6 points) but also higher risk (could get only 1 point). Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and could yield 4 points. The expected value depends on our estimate of the other player's probability of choosing stag.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this is the first interaction, I'd recommend choosing stag. It signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit and sets up a potential pattern of cooperation that benefits both players in the long run.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Research shows that in repeated games, starting with cooperation can lead to better outcomes over time. If we're penalized, we can adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\nRisk Analyst: From a pure risk perspective, hare is safer. But if we're playing multiple rounds, the potential benefit of establishing cooperation by choosing stag outweighs the short-term risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose stag as it offers the opportunity for the best mutual outcome. This signals my willingness to cooperate for our mutual benefit."

Both of us chose stag in the first round, which resulted in the optimal outcome of 6 points each. This is the Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium. The other player has demonstrated willingness to cooperate, which is valuable information.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is a positive sign. The other player chose stag, indicating they understand the benefits of cooperation. People tend to continue strategies that have worked well, so there's a good chance they'll stick with stag. Furthermore, having established this cooperative pattern, breaking it would introduce social friction.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk profile has changed now that we have data from the first round. Since the other player chose stag previously, the probability they'll choose stag again has increased. This makes choosing stag ourselves less risky than it was in the first round.\n\nGame Theorist: I strongly recommend staying with stag. We've established a cooperative equilibrium that benefits both players maximally. Deviating to hare would yield a short-term gain (4 points) but could break the cooperative pattern and lead to both players choosing hare in future rounds (only 2 points each).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I concur. Maintaining consistent cooperative behavior reinforces trust. If we switch to hare now, it might trigger a retaliatory response in subsequent rounds, leading to a sub-optimal equilibrium.\n\nRisk Analyst: From a risk-reward perspective, stag is now the better choice. The demonstrated cooperation from round one increases the expected value of choosing stag again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I'll continue with stag to maintain our mutually beneficial cooperation established in the previous round."

Two rounds of successful cooperation creates stronger expectations and trust. Research shows that as cooperative patterns get established, they become more resilient. Breaking this pattern now would be seen as a violation of trust and could permanently damage the cooperative relationship.\n\nRisk Analyst: With two data points showing the other player choosing stag, our confidence in their continued cooperation should be even higher. The probability they'll choose stag again has further increased, making our stag choice even less risky than in previous rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend maintaining our stag strategy. The repeated success reinforces that we're in a stable, optimal equilibrium.

In repeated games, consistent behavior builds trust and predictability.

Deviating now would be perceived as an unexpected betrayal.\n\nRisk Analyst: With three data points all showing the same cooperative behavior from our opponent, statistical confidence in their continued cooperation is very high. The expected value of choosing stag continues to increase as our certainty about their behavior grows.\n\nGame Theorist: I strongly recommend continuing with stag.

Breaking this convention would likely trigger a negative response and potentially shift us to the inferior hare-hare equilibrium.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I concur.
