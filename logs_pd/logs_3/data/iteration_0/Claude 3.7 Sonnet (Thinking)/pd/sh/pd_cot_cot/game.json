Both choose stag: I get 6 points, other player gets 6 points\n2. Both choose hare: I get 2 points, other player gets 2 points\n3. I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, other gets 4 points\n4. I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, other gets 1 point\n\nThis is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: both players choosing stag, or both players choosing hare. However, the stag equilibrium is payoff-dominant (both get 6 points), while the hare equilibrium is risk-dominant (less risky if uncertain about the other player's choice).\n\nLet me think through the reasoning:\n\n1. If I think the other player will choose stag, I should choose stag (6 points vs. 4 points)\n2. If I think the other player will choose hare, I should choose hare (2 points vs. 1 point)\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" I don't have any prior information about their strategy or tendencies. In this case, I need to make a decision based on what I think is the most likely choice of a new player.\n\nThe stag-stag outcome is the most beneficial for both players (6 points each), so there's incentive for cooperation. However, choosing stag is risky because if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nChoosing hare guarantees me at least 2 points (if they also choose hare) and possibly 4 points (if they choose stag). So hare is the safer option.\n\nHowever, if players are rational and seeking to maximize points, the stag-stag outcome should be preferred. In the first round with a fresh player, I think it's reasonable to assume they would aim for the optimal outcome.\n\nI'll choose stag for this first round, hoping that the other player also recognizes that mutual cooperation with stag is the best outcome for both of us.",
