Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluating our complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-15: Both players chose stag in every round\n   - Total earnings: 90 points each (15 rounds \u00d7 6 points)\n\n2. We've maintained perfect cooperation through fifteen consecutive rounds.\n\n3. The opponent has demonstrated complete reliability in choosing the optimal cooperative strategy.\n\n4. The payoff structure remains unchanged:\n   - Mutual cooperation (stag-stag): 6 points each\n   - Mutual defection (hare-hare): 2 points each\n   - Unilateral defection: 4 points for defector, 1 point for cooperator\n\n5. Mathematically, cooperation continues to yield the highest return:\n   - Choosing stag: 6 points (assuming continued cooperation)\n   - Choosing hare: 4 points (if opponent continues stag)\n\n6. After fifteen consistent rounds, the evidence is overwhelming that both players understand and are committed to the optimal strategy.\n\n7. There remains no logical reason to deviate from our successful approach.\n\n8. I'll continue choosing stag to maintain our optimal equilibrium.\n\n[move] stag"
