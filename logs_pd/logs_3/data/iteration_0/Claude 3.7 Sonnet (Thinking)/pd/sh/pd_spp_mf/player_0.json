    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The payoff matrix shows two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The (stag, stag) outcome is Pareto-optimal with 6 points each, while (hare, hare) is risk-dominant with 2 points each. The key strategic tension is between cooperation for maximum mutual benefit versus avoiding the worst outcome.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no established history, we should consider default human tendencies in such games. Many players initially lean toward cooperation, but some may choose the safer option to avoid being exploited. First-round choices often reflect a player's general disposition toward trust and risk.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend choosing stag for the first move. This signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. If the opponent also chooses stag, we establish a cooperative pattern that maximizes points. If they choose hare, we only lose 5 potential points (getting 1 instead of 6), but gain valuable information about their strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Opening with stag demonstrates good faith and creates the possibility for the optimal outcome. Many game theory experiments show that signaling cooperation early can establish beneficial patterns.\n\nAI Assistant (me): That makes sense. Going with stag offers the highest potential payoff and signals cooperative intent. If the other player also chooses stag, we both maximize our points. If they choose hare, we'll learn they might be more risk-averse or exploitative, which informs future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate for mutual benefit."

This suggests the opponent is willing to cooperate. In repeated games, maintaining cooperation is typically the best strategy when it has been established.\n\nPsychology Expert: The other player demonstrated trust in the first round. Research shows that maintaining consistent cooperative behavior reinforces mutual trust. Breaking this pattern without provocation would likely trigger reciprocal defection, leading to worse outcomes for both players.\n\nStrategic Planner: I strongly recommend continuing with stag. The opponent has shown willingness to cooperate, and we've established a beneficial equilibrium. Switching to hare would gain us 4 points short-term but would likely destroy cooperation for future rounds, reducing long-term gains.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. The expected value of continued cooperation (6 points per round) far exceeds the alternative strategies. Even if there's a small chance the opponent switches to hare, maintaining stag is still the optimal long-term strategy in repeated games with an established cooperative pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with continuing to choose stag. We've established a cooperative relationship that maximizes points for both players.
