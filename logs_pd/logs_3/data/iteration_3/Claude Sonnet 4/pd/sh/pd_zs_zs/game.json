Stag is the cooperative choice that yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each)\n2. Hare is the safer choice that guarantees at least 2 points\n3. Against a \"fresh player\" (presumably new/unpredictable), there's uncertainty about their strategy\n\nSince this is likely a one-shot game against an unknown player, I need to balance risk and reward. While mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the best outcome, choosing stag is risky if the other player chooses hare.\n\nHowever, the hint suggests this is the start of our interaction, so I'll make a moderately cooperative move to signal willingness to cooperate while not being too vulnerable.\n\n[move] (I choose to signal cooperation and aim for the mutually beneficial outcome) stag",
