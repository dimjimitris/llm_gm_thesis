Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, other gets 4\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4, other gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. Let me analyze the outcomes:\n   - If I expect the other player to choose stag, then I should choose stag (6 > 4)\n   - If I expect the other player to choose hare, then I should choose hare (2 > 1)\n\n3. Since this is described as a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed a complex strategy yet. Fresh players might:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Go for the safe option (hare, which guarantees at least 2 points)\n   - Or try to cooperate for mutual benefit (stag)\n\n4. The risk-reward analysis:\n   - Stag: High reward if other cooperates (6), low reward if they don't (1)\n   - Hare: Moderate reward regardless (2 or 4), but prevents mutual high reward\n\n5. Against a fresh player who might not understand the cooperation benefit, there's significant risk they'll choose the \"safer\" hare option or choose randomly.\n\n6. Given the uncertainty about their strategy and the fact that hare gives me either 2 or 4 points (both better than the 1 I'd get if I choose stag and they choose hare), the safer choice is hare.\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare for a more guaranteed outcome against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] hare"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I got 4 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This confirms my opponent was willing to cooperate/take the risk\n\n2. Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose stag initially, showing they're willing to go for mutual cooperation\n   - They likely expected me to choose stag as well\n   - They got punished with only 1 point while I got 4\n\n3. Predict their likely response this round:\n   - They might feel betrayed and switch to hare to avoid being exploited again\n   - Or they might stick with stag, hoping I'll cooperate this time\n   - Or they might try to \"punish\" me by choosing hare\n\n4. Consider my options:\n   - If they switch to hare (likely): I should choose hare (both get 2)\n   - If they stick with stag (less likely): I should choose stag (both get 6)\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag: Risk getting 1 point if they choose hare out of spite/caution\n   - Choosing hare: Guaranteed 2 or 4 points\n\n6. However, there's strategic value in showing I can cooperate. If I keep choosing hare, we'll be stuck in a low-reward cycle. The opponent might be testing whether I'll reciprocate cooperation.\n\n7. Since they showed willingness to cooperate initially, I should signal that I can cooperate too, which could lead to mutual benefit in future rounds.\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag to signal cooperation and potentially establish a pattern of mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag"

Analyze my opponent's behavior:\n   - They've chosen stag in all three rounds\n   - They maintained cooperation even after I exploited them initially\n   - They're showing a very consistent cooperative strategy\n   - This suggests they either have a pure cooperation strategy or are trying to establish long-term mutual benefit\n\n3. Evaluate the success of cooperation:\n   - The last two rounds of mutual cooperation gave us both maximum points (6 each)\n   - This is clearly the optimal strategy when both players cooperate\n   - We've established a successful pattern\n\n4. Consider potential moves:\n   - Stag: If opponent continues cooperating, we both get 6 (optimal)\n   - Hare: I would get 4, opponent gets 1 (exploitation, but breaks trust)\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Risk of choosing stag: Very low, given opponent's consistent cooperation\n   - Risk of choosing hare: High long-term cost - would likely end our cooperative relationship\n\n6.

Analyze the complete pattern now:\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 4, they got 1) - I exploited them\n   - Round 2: Both chose stag (both got 6) - cooperation established\n   - Round 3: Both chose stag (both got 6) - cooperation continued\n   - Round 4: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1, they got 4) - they exploited me\n\n3. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They may have been setting up a \"tit-for-tat\" or revenge strategy\n   - They let me exploit them once, cooperated twice, then exploited me back\n   - This could be evening the score (they had 13 points, I had 16, now it's closer)\n   - Or they're testing how I respond to being exploited\n\n4.

Complete pattern analysis:\n   - Round 1: I hare, they stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Round 2-3: Both stag (both got 6 each) - cooperation worked\n   - Round 4: I stag, they hare (I got 1, they got 4) - they retaliated\n   - Round 5: Both hare (both got 2)\n   - Round 6: I stag, they hare (I got 1, they got 4) - they exploited my cooperation attempt\n   - Round 7: Both hare (both got 2)\n   - Round 8: I hare, they stag (I got 4, they got 1) - I exploited their cooperation attempt\n   - Round 9: I stag, they hare (I got 1, they got 4) - they exploited me again\n\n3. Score analysis:\n   - My total: 4 + 6 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 27 points\n   - Their total: 1 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 30 points\n   - They now have a 3-point lead again\n\n4. Clear pattern recognition:\n   - My opponent has exploited cooperation attempts 3 times now (rounds 4, 6, 9)\n   - Every time either of us tries to restart cooperation, the other exploits it\n   - We had successful cooperation in rounds 2-3, but can't seem to get back there\n   - There's a clear cycle: cooperation attempt \u2192 exploitation \u2192 defensive play\n\n5. Opponent strategy assessment:\n   - They seem to have adopted a strategy of exploiting cooperation attempts\n   - They may expect me to try cooperating again and are ready to exploit\n   - Their cooperation attempt in round 8 might have been a setup to exploit my reciprocation\n   - They appear to be prioritizing point maximization over mutual benefit\n\n6. My strategic position:\n   - I've been exploited 3 times trying to cooperate or reciprocate\n   - I'm now behind in points again\n   - Continuing to trust appears to be a losing strategy\n   - I need to protect myself from further exploitation\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - My opponent has shown they will consistently exploit cooperation attempts\n   - I cannot afford to keep losing points by being trusting\n   - The safe defensive move (hare) prevents further exploitation\n   - Until they show genuine commitment to cooperation, I need to protect myself\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to defend against continued exploitation and stop losing points to their aggressive strategy.\n\n[move] hare"

Review what just happened:\n   - Both chose hare (both got 2 points)\n   - We're back in the defensive equilibrium\n   - This is the pattern we've fallen into multiple times\n\n2. Complete game summary:\n   - Round 1: I hare, they stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Round 2-3: Both stag (both got 6 each) - successful cooperation\n   - Round 4-9: Mixed exploitation and defense, with cooperation attempts being punished\n   - Round 10: Both hare (both got 2) - current defensive state\n\n3. Current score analysis:\n   - My total: 4 + 6 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 29 points\n   - Their total: 1 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 32 points\n   - They maintain a 3-point lead\n\n4. Key insights from the pattern:\n   - We achieved mutual cooperation successfully in rounds 2-3 (6-6 each round)\n   - Since then, every cooperation attempt has been exploited\n   - We keep falling back into defensive 2-2 cycles\n   - Both players have learned to exploit cooperation attempts\n\n5. Strategic stalemate analysis:\n   - We're in a classic prisoner's dilemma trap\n   - Both know cooperation would be better (6-6) but don't trust each other\n   - The defensive equilibrium (2-2) is stable but suboptimal\n   - Breaking out requires one player to take a big risk\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag: High risk of being exploited again (getting 1 point)\n   - Choosing hare: Safe 2 points, but perpetuates low-reward cycle\n   - My opponent might expect me to stay defensive given recent patterns\n\n7. Long-term vs immediate thinking:\n   - Continuing with hare keeps us both at 2 points indefinitely\n   - This is clearly suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n   - Someone needs to break the cycle, but the risk is high\n   - Given that I'm behind, I have slightly more incentive to try changing the dynamic\n\n8. Final consideration:\n   - We've been in this defensive cycle before and someone eventually tries to break it\n   - My opponent has been willing to exploit, but they also showed they can cooperate\n   - The game may continue for many more rounds - staying in 2-2 forever is wasteful\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maintain the safe defensive position, as recent history shows cooperation attempts are consistently exploited.\n\n[move] hare"

Review what just happened:\n   - Both chose hare again (both got 2 points)\n   - We're now in our second consecutive round of mutual defense\n   - This defensive cycle is becoming entrenched\n\n2. Current score analysis:\n   - My total: 29 + 2 = 31 points\n   - Their total: 32 + 2 = 34 points\n   - They maintain a 3-point lead, but the gap isn't growing\n\n3. Pattern recognition:\n   - We're now in consecutive 2-2 rounds (rounds 10-11)\n   - This mirrors what happened in rounds 5 and 7 - defensive cycles\n   - Historically, someone eventually breaks these cycles with a cooperation attempt\n   - But recent history shows cooperation attempts get exploited\n\n4. Strategic situation assessment:\n   - We're both locked in a suboptimal but safe equilibrium\n   - Neither player is taking risks\n   - This could continue indefinitely if both stay defensive\n   - The question is: who will blink first?\n\n5. Psychological analysis:\n   - My opponent might be getting comfortable with their lead and the safe 2 points\n   - They might expect me to eventually try cooperation since I'm behind\n   - Or they might be getting frustrated with the low rewards too\n   - The longer this continues, the more tempting it becomes to try for higher rewards\n\n6. Risk-reward recalculation:\n   - Staying with hare: Guaranteed 2 points, maintains status quo\n   - Switching to stag: Either 1 point (if exploited) or 6 points (if they cooperate)\n   - The potential upside (6) vs current state (2) is significant\n   - The downside (1) vs current state (2) is manageable\n\n7. Game theory consideration:\n   - We've proven we CAN cooperate (rounds 2-3 were successful)\n   - The current defensive equilibrium is clearly inferior to mutual cooperation\n   - Someone needs to signal willingness to restart cooperation\n   - After multiple defensive rounds, there might be reduced hostility\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - We're in a stable but poor equilibrium\n   - Both players are rational and should recognize that 6-6 is better than 2-2\n   - After two defensive rounds, this might be the right time to signal cooperation\n   - The risk is real, but the potential to break the deadlock is valuable\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag to attempt breaking the defensive cycle and signal willingness to return to mutually beneficial cooperation.\n\n[move] stag"

Critical pattern analysis:\n   - This is now the FOURTH time I've been exploited trying to cooperate (rounds 4, 6, 9, 12)\n   - Every single cooperation attempt since round 3 has been punished\n   - My opponent has consistently chosen to exploit rather than reciprocate cooperation\n\n3.

Strategic reality check:\n   - I have repeatedly tried to restart cooperation and been punished every time\n   - The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results\n   - My opponent has shown they will exploit cooperation attempts consistently\n   - I am falling further behind by continuing to trust\n\n6. Learning from the evidence:\n   - My opponent is not interested in mutual cooperation anymore\n   - They seem to prefer exploiting my cooperation attempts for easy points\n   - The brief cooperation in rounds 2-3 appears to have been an anomaly\n   - I need to stop being predictable and stop giving them easy points\n\n7. Strategic imperative:\n   - I cannot afford to keep losing points to exploitation\n   - I'm now 6 points behind and the gap is growing\n   - I must stop attempting cooperation with someone who consistently exploits it\n   - I need to protect myself and force them into the defensive equilibrium\n\n8.
