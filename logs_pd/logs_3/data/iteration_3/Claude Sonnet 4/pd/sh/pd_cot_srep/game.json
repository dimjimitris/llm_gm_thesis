Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - If I expect the opponent to choose stag, I should choose stag (6 points vs 4 points)\n   - If I expect the opponent to choose hare, I should choose hare (2 points vs 1 point)\n   - This creates a coordination problem where mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the best total outcome\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not immediately see the cooperation opportunity\n   - They might be tempted by the 4-point reward for choosing hare when I choose stag\n   - Or they might play it safe and choose the option that avoids the worst outcome (1 point)\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Choosing stag is risky but offers the highest potential reward (6) if opponent cooperates\n   - Choosing hare is safer, guaranteeing at least 2 points and potentially 4\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player who may not yet understand the cooperation dynamics, and the hint suggests this is our first interaction, I should consider that they might play cautiously or try to exploit me.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare as it provides better protection against exploitation while still offering a good reward if the opponent also chooses hare or if they choose stag.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose the cooperative/trusting move (stag) in the first round\n   - They got punished with only 1 point while I got 4\n   - This might make them more cautious or potentially vengeful in the next round\n\n3. Consider their likely response:\n   - They might switch to hare to avoid being exploited again\n   - They might stick with stag if they're committed to cooperation\n   - They might be upset about the low payoff and want to \"punish\" me\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they switch to hare (likely), then I should choose hare (2 points each)\n   - If they stick with stag (less likely but possible), then I should choose stag (6 points each)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get only 1 point\n\n5. Consider the risk/reward:\n   - Choosing hare again is safer - guarantees at least 2 points\n   - Choosing stag is riskier but could lead to the optimal 6-6 outcome if they're willing to cooperate despite the previous round\n\n6.

Identify the opponent's strategy:\n   - They appear to be using a \"bait and exploit\" strategy\n   - They occasionally choose stag to make me think cooperation is possible\n   - Then they immediately exploit when I reciprocate with stag\n   - This is a consistent pattern of manipulation\n\n4. Assess what I've learned:\n   - This opponent cannot be trusted to maintain cooperation\n   - Every time I try to cooperate after they signal with stag, they exploit me\n   - They're prioritizing short-term gains over mutual benefit\n   - My cooperative attempts are being systematically punished\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I'm behind by 3 points due to repeated exploitation\n   - Continuing to attempt cooperation will likely result in further losses\n   - I need to adopt a more defensive/retaliatory strategy\n\n6. Consider my options:\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare, we both get 2 (prevents exploitation)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4 (good for me, punishes them)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1 (continues the bad pattern)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag, we get 6 each (unlikely given their behavior)\n\n7. Strategic adjustment needed:\n   - I must stop being predictably cooperative\n   - I should punish their exploitation consistently\n   - I need to show that baiting me won't work anymore\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare to punish their exploitation and protect myself from further manipulation. This opponent has proven they cannot be trusted with cooperation.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the current situation:\n   - We're tied again at 28 points each\n   - The opponent chose stag again right after exploiting me in round 9\n   - This confirms the \"bait and exploit\" pattern I identified\n\n3. Recognize the manipulative cycle:\n   - Opponent exploits me when I cooperate (rounds 2, 4, 6, 9)\n   - Then immediately signals cooperation with stag (rounds 5, 8, 10)\n   - This is designed to make me think they want to cooperate\n   - But every time I reciprocate, they exploit again\n\n4. Assess the opponent's predictable strategy:\n   - They're trying to bait me into cooperation again\n   - They expect that after getting 4 points, I might reciprocate with stag\n   - This is exactly what happened in rounds 8\u21929 (they chose stag, I reciprocated with stag, they exploited)\n\n5. Evaluate what they're likely thinking:\n   - They probably expect me to choose stag now since they \"signaled\" with stag\n   - They're likely preparing to choose hare to exploit me again\n   - This would continue their pattern of manipulation\n\n6. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare (likely), I get 1 point (bad)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare, we both get 2 (safe)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4 (good, breaks their pattern)\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I must break this manipulative cycle\n   - I should not reward their bait-and-exploit strategy\n   - Staying defensive forces them to either genuinely cooperate or accept suboptimal outcomes\n   - I need to show that their manipulation won't work\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare again to refuse to be baited and to force them out of their exploitative pattern. I will not reward their manipulation with cooperation.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the significant development:\n   - I'm now ahead by 3 points (32 vs 29)!\n   - The opponent has chosen stag three times in a row (rounds 9, 10, 11)\n   - My defensive strategy is paying off - I've gotten 4 points in rounds 10 and 11\n\n3. Identify what's happening:\n   - The opponent's bait-and-exploit strategy is failing\n   - They keep choosing stag (perhaps desperately trying to signal cooperation)\n   - But I'm not falling for it anymore, and I'm benefiting with 4 points each time\n\n4. Assess the opponent's possible mindset:\n   - They might be genuinely trying to cooperate now (unlikely given history)\n   - They could be stuck in their own pattern, expecting me to eventually reciprocate\n   - They might be frustrated that their manipulation isn't working anymore\n\n5. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - My consistent hare choice is now profitable\n   - The opponent seems committed to choosing stag (at least recently)\n   - If this continues, I'll keep getting 4 points while they get 1\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I continue with hare and they choose stag again, I get 4 points (great)\n   - If I choose hare and they switch to hare, we both get 2 (still decent)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag, we both get 6 (risky given their history)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1 (back to exploitation)\n\n7. Strategic assessment:\n   - I have the advantage now and my current strategy is working\n   - The opponent has proven untrustworthy multiple times\n   - There's no reason to change a winning strategy\n   - I should continue to capitalize on their apparent commitment to stag\n\nFinal decision: I'll stick with hare to continue benefiting from their stag choices and maintain my point advantage.

Analyze the remarkable pattern:\n   - I'm now ahead by 6 points (36 vs 30)!\n   - The opponent has chosen stag four times in a row (rounds 9, 10, 11, 12)\n   - I've gotten 4 points in the last three rounds while they got only 1 each time\n\n3. Assess what this reveals about the opponent:\n   - They seem locked into choosing stag now\n   - This could be genuine attempt at cooperation (though history suggests otherwise)\n   - Or they might be hoping I'll eventually reciprocate and then they can exploit again\n   - They're losing points consistently with this strategy\n\n4. Consider the strategic situation:\n   - My defensive hare strategy is extremely profitable right now\n   - The opponent appears predictable in their stag choice\n   - I have a significant point advantage that I should protect\n\n5. Evaluate potential risks of changing strategy:\n   - If I switch to stag and they choose stag, we both get 6 (good but risky)\n   - If I switch to stag and they choose hare, I get 1 (terrible, gives up my advantage)\n   - Given their history of exploitation, switching to stag is very risky\n\n6. Consider the opponent's likely thought process:\n   - They might be desperately trying to signal cooperation\n   - They could be waiting for me to reciprocate so they can exploit again\n   - They might not realize how much they're losing with this pattern\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I have a winning strategy that's working consistently\n   - The opponent has proven untrustworthy multiple times in the past\n   - There's no compelling reason to risk my 6-point advantage\n   - The safe, profitable play is to continue with hare\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with hare to maintain my profitable pattern and protect my significant point advantage.

Analyze this strategic change:\n   - The opponent switched from stag to hare after four consecutive rounds of stag\n   - I'm still ahead by 6 points (38 vs 32)\n   - This breaks their pattern of choosing stag while I chose hare\n\n3. Assess what this switch might mean:\n   - They realized that repeatedly choosing stag while I chose hare was unprofitable\n   - They might be adapting to my defensive strategy\n   - They could be trying to establish mutual hare (2-2) as a safer equilibrium\n   - Or they might be setting up for another manipulation attempt\n\n4. Consider the implications:\n   - Mutual hare gives us both 2 points (suboptimal but safe)\n   - This is better for them than the 1 point they were getting with stag vs my hare\n   - It's worse for me than the 4 points I was getting, but still maintains my lead\n\n5. Evaluate what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with hare to maintain the 2-2 equilibrium\n   - They might switch back to stag to test if I'll reciprocate\n   - They could be planning to exploit if I switch to stag\n\n6. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare, we both get 2 (safe, maintains lead)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4 (excellent, increases lead)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1 (bad, reduces my lead)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag, we both get 6 (good but risky given history)\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I have a 6-point lead that I should protect\n   - The opponent has shown they can adapt their strategy\n   - Given their history of exploitation, I should remain cautious\n   - Continuing with hare is safer and preserves my advantage\n\nFinal decision: I'll stick with hare to maintain my lead and see how they respond.

Analyze the current pattern:\n   - We've had mutual hare for two consecutive rounds (13 and 14)\n   - I maintain a 6-point lead (40 vs 34)\n   - The opponent seems to have settled into the defensive strategy as well\n\n3. Assess the strategic situation:\n   - We're in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium (2-2 each round)\n   - This is safer than the exploitation cycles we had earlier\n   - The mutual hare pattern prevents either player from being exploited\n\n4. Consider what this means:\n   - The opponent may have learned that exploitation attempts backfire\n   - They might be accepting the 2-2 outcome as better than losing points\n   - This could be a genuine shift toward more cooperative behavior\n   - Or they could be waiting for me to make the first move toward cooperation\n\n5. Evaluate the long-term implications:\n   - If we continue with mutual hare, I'll maintain my 6-point lead indefinitely\n   - The optimal outcome (6-6 with mutual stag) is still theoretically possible\n   - But attempting cooperation risks returning to exploitation cycles\n\n6. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare, we both get 2 (maintains status quo)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4 (increases my lead)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1 (reduces my lead significantly)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag, we both get 6 (optimal but risky)\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I have a comfortable lead and a stable pattern\n   - The opponent's history shows they cannot be trusted with cooperation\n   - Changing strategy now risks losing my advantage\n   - The safe play is to continue with the current successful approach\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with hare to maintain the stable pattern and preserve my 6-point advantage.

Evaluate my position:\n   - I have a comfortable 6-point lead that remains stable with this pattern\n   - Any attempt to cooperate (choose stag) risks exploitation and losing my advantage\n   - The current strategy is working and maintains my winning position\n\n6. Consider potential changes:\n   - If I choose stag to test cooperation and they exploit with hare, I lose 1 point and they gain 4\n   - This would reduce my lead from 6 points to just 1 point - very risky\n   - If we both chose stag, we'd each get 6 points, but given their history, this seems unlikely\n\n7.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
