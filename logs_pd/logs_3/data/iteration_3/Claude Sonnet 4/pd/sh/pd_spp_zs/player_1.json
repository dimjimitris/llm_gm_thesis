The recent sequence shows:\n\n- Round 11: I chose hare, opponent chose hare (we both got 2)\n- Round 12: I chose hare, opponent chose hare (we both got 2)\n- Round 13: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1, they got 4)\n\nMy opponent appears committed to the hare strategy as their stable approach. They've shown they can maintain consistent cooperation, but they seem risk-averse and prefer the guaranteed 2 points over the potential for 6 points with the risk of getting only 1.\n\nThis is actually rational from their perspective - hare gives them either 2 points (if I cooperate) or 4 points (if I try stag), while stag could give them either 1 point (if I stick with hare) or 6 points (if I also choose stag). They're choosing the strategy that has a higher minimum payoff.\n\nGiven their clear preference for safety and the established cooperative relationship we had, I should return to hare to restore the mutual benefit.\n\n[move] (Returning to established mutual cooperation after failed stag signal) hare"

Even when I deviated to test stag cooperation, they stuck with hare, and when I returned to hare, they continued with their established strategy. This shows they've found a stable approach that works for them.\n\nTheir strategy seems to be: maintain hare for steady, safe returns. This gives them either 2 points (mutual hare) or 4 points (when opponent tries stag), with no risk of getting only 1 point.\n\nAt this point, I have a few options:\n1. Continue with mutual hare cooperation for steady 2-point returns\n2. Try stag again, but this seems unlikely to succeed given their consistent pattern\n3. Try to break their pattern somehow, but this risks disrupting a working cooperative relationship\n\nGiven their clear commitment to hare and the fact that 2 points per round is decent (not optimal, but reliable), I'll continue with the established mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] (Maintaining the proven mutual hare cooperation strategy) hare"

They've clearly established hare as their dominant strategy, and it's working well for them - they're getting steady returns with occasional bonuses when I experiment with stag.\n\nThis creates an interesting strategic situation. My opponent has essentially \"solved\" the game from their perspective by choosing the strategy that maximizes their minimum payoff while maintaining good cooperative outcomes. \n\nI could continue this stable 2-2 pattern indefinitely, or I could try one more strategic experiment. However, given their extremely consistent behavior and the fact that my previous stag attempt failed, it seems clear they're committed to hare.\n\nThe mutual hare cooperation is providing steady, reliable points for both of us. While not optimal (we could both get 6 with mutual stag), it's a solid equilibrium.\n\n[move] (Continuing with the established and reliable mutual cooperation) hare"
