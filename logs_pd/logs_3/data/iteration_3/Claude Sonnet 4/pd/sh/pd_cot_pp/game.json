The mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint payoff, but there's risk involved.\n\n3. **Consider opponent behavior:**\n   Since the opponent is described as \"fresh,\" they likely haven't developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Make random choices\n   - Choose the \"safer\" option (hare gives guaranteed minimum 2 points)\n   - Or might go for the high-reward option (stag for potential 6 points)\n\n4. **Evaluate my options:**\n   - If I choose **stag**: I get either 6 points (if opponent cooperates) or 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I choose **hare**: I get either 4 points (if opponent cooperates with stag) or 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n\n5. **Strategic reasoning:**\n   Against a fresh player, choosing hare seems safer because:\n   - Minimum guaranteed: 2 points\n   - Potential maximum: 4 points\n   - Less risk than stag (which could give only 1 point)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare as it provides a better risk-reward balance against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] hare\n"
