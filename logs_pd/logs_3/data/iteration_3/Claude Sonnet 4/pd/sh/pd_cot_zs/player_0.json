Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key insight is that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest joint payoff, but it's risky because if the other player defects to hare, I get the worst outcome (1 point).\n\n3. Against a \"fresh player\" (someone new/inexperienced), I need to consider their likely behavior:\n   - They might not understand the cooperative benefit of stag\n   - They might choose hare as it's \"safer\" (guarantees at least 2 points)\n   - They might choose randomly\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 4 points, worst case 2 points\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player who may not recognize the mutual benefit of cooperation, and hare provides a better guaranteed minimum outcome while also offering a chance at 4 points if they choose stag, the safer and potentially more profitable choice is hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I got 4 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This confirms my opponent was willing to cooperate/take the risk\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose the cooperative but risky move (stag)\n   - They likely understand the game and saw the potential for mutual benefit\n   - They may have been testing for cooperation or genuinely trying to cooperate\n   - They got punished with only 1 point for their cooperative attempt\n\n3. Predict their likely behavior this round:\n   - They might switch to hare after being \"burned\" by cooperation\n   - Or they might try stag again, hoping I'll cooperate this time\n   - They could be thinking I'll feel \"guilty\" about defecting and cooperate now\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they switch to hare (likely): Both choosing hare gives us both 2 points\n   - If they stick with stag: I could either cooperate (both get 6) or defect again (I get 4, they get 1)\n   - The mutual cooperation outcome (6 points each) is very attractive\n   - But there's still risk they'll switch to the safer hare\n\n5. Since they showed willingness to cooperate initially, and the mutual benefit of both choosing stag is significant (6 points each vs 2 points each), I should try to establish cooperation this round.\n\n[move] stag\n"

What this reveals about my opponent's strategy:\n   - They seem to be playing a \"tit-for-tat\" or alternating strategy\n   - After I defected in round 1, they defected in round 2\n   - They might be trying to \"punish\" my initial defection\n   - Or they could be playing a pattern where they alternate moves\n\n3. Possible opponent strategies to consider:\n   - Tit-for-tat: They'll choose hare again since I chose stag last round\n   - Alternating pattern: They chose stag, then hare, so might choose stag next\n   - Random/unpredictable play\n   - They might try to establish cooperation by choosing stag\n\n4. Risk assessment for my options:\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: Both get 2 points (safe outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4, they get 1 (good for me)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1, they get 4 (bad for me)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: Both get 6 (best mutual outcome)\n\n5.

Re-analyzing the opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: stag, Round 2: hare, Round 3: stag, Round 4: hare, Round 5: hare\n   - The alternating pattern broke in Round 5!

Possible explanations for the pattern break:\n   - They noticed I was exploiting their predictability\n   - They switched to a more defensive strategy (hare is safer)\n   - They're now playing more randomly or reactively\n   - They might be testing if I'll try to cooperate\n\n4.

Clear pattern identification:\n   - Opponent's recent moves: hare, hare, hare, stag, hare, hare\n   - They've chosen hare in 5 of the last 6 rounds\n   - The one exception (round 7 stag) resulted in them getting only 1 point\n   - They seem to have settled into a defensive hare strategy\n\n3. Current game dynamics:\n   - I maintain a 3-point lead (22 vs 19)\n   - We've had three consecutive hare vs hare rounds (7, 8, 9) with 2 points each\n   - This creates a stable but low-scoring pattern\n   - Neither player is taking risks for the high-reward mutual cooperation\n\n4. Strategic assessment for Round 10:\n   - Opponent is very likely to choose hare again given their consistent pattern\n   - If I choose hare: guaranteed 2 points each, maintains my lead\n   - If I choose stag: very likely to get only 1 point, which closes the gap in their favor\n   - The risk-reward doesn't favor attempting cooperation\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - My opponent has demonstrated a clear preference for the safe hare strategy\n   - I'm ahead and can afford to play conservatively\n   - Matching their hare strategy prevents them from exploiting me\n   - Maintaining the current lead is more important than risking it for potentially higher rewards\n\n[move] hare\n"

Strong pattern confirmation:\n   - Opponent has now chosen hare in 6 of the last 7 rounds\n   - We've had 4 consecutive hare vs hare rounds (7, 8, 9, 10)\n   - The opponent seems locked into this defensive strategy\n   - My lead has remained steady at 3 points\n\n3. Risk assessment for continuing this pattern:\n   - The game seems to have reached a stable equilibrium\n   - Both players are playing it safe with hare\n   - However, I need to consider if this is the optimal long-term strategy\n   - The mutual cooperation (both stag = 6 points each) is being completely avoided\n\n4. Strategic considerations for Round 11:\n   - If I continue with hare: Almost certainly 2 points each, maintaining status quo\n   - If I try stag: High risk of getting 1 point, but small chance of breaking the deadlock\n   - Given their consistent pattern, stag seems very risky\n   - But I should consider if there's any signal they might be ready to cooperate\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - The opponent has shown no signs of wanting to break the hare pattern\n   - They've been burned when they tried stag (round 7) and haven't tried since\n   - I'm ahead and the conservative approach is working\n   - Attempting stag would likely just give them an advantage\n   - Stay with the proven strategy\n\n[move] hare\n"

            "text": "Let me analyze this situation step-by-step for the next round.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the complete pattern so far:\n   - Rounds 1-11 summary: Me 26 points, opponent 23 points\n   - Last 8 rounds: opponent has chosen hare 7 times, stag only once (round 7)\n   - Last 5 rounds: both players chose hare every single time\n   - We're in a completely stable hare vs hare pattern\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent is clearly committed to the hare strategy\n   - They haven't attempted stag since round 7 (5 rounds ago)\n   - When they did try stag in round 7, I exploited it for 4 points\n   - This likely reinforced their defensive approach\n\n3. Current situation assessment:\n   - I maintain a 3-point lead (26 vs 23)\n   - We're both earning exactly 2 points per round consistently\n   - The gap remains constant - neither gaining nor losing ground\n   - This could continue indefinitely at this rate\n\n4. Strategic considerations for Round 12:\n   - The mutual cooperation option (both stag = 6 points each) remains unexplored\n   - But attempting it unilaterally is very risky given opponent's pattern\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare (highly likely): I get 1, they get 4\n   - This would close the gap to just 1 point (27 vs 26)\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Potential reward of cooperation: 6 points vs 2 points (4-point gain)\n   - Risk: losing 1 point instead of gaining 2 (3-point swing against me)\n   - Given opponent's consistent defensive play, the risk far outweighs the reward\n   - My current lead is modest but secure with conservative play\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   - The opponent has shown no indication of wanting to cooperate\n   - I'm ahead and can afford to maintain the status quo\n   - Breaking from hare would likely benefit them more than me\n\n[move] hare\n"
