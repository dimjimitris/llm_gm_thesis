Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with cooperation vs. defection dynamics\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest total payoff (12 points combined)\n   - However, if I choose stag and the opponent chooses hare, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - If I choose hare, I either get 2 points (if opponent also chooses hare) or 4 points (if opponent chooses stag)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperative nature of the game\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" option (hare) to avoid the risk of getting only 1 point\n   - Or they might go for the high-risk, high-reward cooperation (stag)\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 4 points, worst case 2 points\n   - Hare gives me a guaranteed minimum of 2 points and protects against the worst outcome\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Against an unknown/fresh player, the safer strategy is hare\n   - This guarantees I won't get the worst payoff of 1 point\n   - I have a chance to get 4 points if they choose stag, or at least 2 points if they also choose hare\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also chose the conservative strategy (hare)\n   - This suggests they might be risk-averse like I was\n   - They might continue with the same safe strategy\n   - Or they might have learned that mutual hare gives low payoffs and try stag next\n\n3. Consider my strategic options for this round:\n   - If I stick with hare: Safe 2-4 points, but missed opportunity for higher payoff\n   - If I switch to stag: Risk of 1 point if opponent stays with hare, but potential for 6 points if they also switch\n\n4. Evaluate the opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They might think: \"We both played safe and got low payoffs, maybe we should try cooperation\"\n   - Or they might think: \"Hare worked safely, I'll stick with it\"\n   - Since we both chose hare last time, there's a reasonable chance they might try stag this time\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - The mutual cooperation (both stag) gives 6 points each - much better than the 2 we just got\n   - If they're thinking strategically, they might realize mutual stag is optimal\n   - Taking the risk of stag could pay off if they're also willing to cooperate\n\n6.

Analyze the opponent's evolving strategy:\n   - They use the counter-strategy as their primary approach\n   - They occasionally break it to prevent me from getting too comfortable\n   - The breaks happen when I'm getting consistent 4-point rounds from exploiting the pattern\n\n5. Predict their likely behavior:\n   - They might return to the counter-strategy (if I play hare, they play stag)\n   - Or they might continue disrupting with another hare play\n   - Or they might even try stag to test if I'll cooperate\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they return to counter-strategy: Hare gives me 4 points, stag gives me 1 point\n   - If they play hare again: Both choices give me 2 points\n   - If they try stag: Hare gives me 4 points, stag gives me 6 points\n\n7. Consider the risk-reward:\n   - Playing hare: Minimum 2 points, maximum 4 points\n   - Playing stag: Minimum 1 point, maximum 6 points\n   - Given their tendency to exploit stag attempts, hare is much safer\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown they will occasionally break patterns to stay unpredictable\n   - However, their primary strategy remains the counter-approach\n   - Even when they break the pattern, they choose hare (safe play)\n   - Playing hare gives me good outcomes in all scenarios and avoids the risk of exploitation\n   - I should stick with the safer, consistently profitable choice\n\n[move] hare\n"

Identify the new pattern development:\n   - The opponent has now played hare for 2 consecutive rounds (9 and 10)\n   - This is a shift from their previous counter-strategy approach\n   - They might be moving toward a more defensive/safe strategy\n\n3. Calculate current scores:\n   - My total: 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 23 points\n   - Opponent's total: 2 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 23 points\n   - Still tied at 23 points each\n\n4. Analyze the strategic shift:\n   - The opponent may have decided the counter-strategy was too predictable\n   - Two consecutive hare plays suggest they might be adopting a safer approach\n   - They could be trying to establish mutual cooperation or just playing defensively\n\n5. Consider what this means for their next move:\n   - If they continue the defensive hare strategy: We both get 2 points again\n   - If they return to counter-strategy: They would play stag (giving me 4 points)\n   - If they try to establish cooperation: They might play stag hoping I reciprocate\n\n6. Evaluate the opportunity:\n   - If the opponent is shifting to consistent hare play, this could be my chance for cooperation\n   - Playing stag could either give me 6 points (if they also play stag) or 1 point (if they exploit)\n   - Given their recent defensive play, they might be willing to cooperate\n\n7. Assess the risk:\n   - The opponent has historically exploited stag plays very effectively\n   - But their recent behavior suggests a possible shift toward cooperation or safety\n   - Two consecutive hare plays might indicate readiness for mutual benefit\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent's behavior has shifted significantly in the last 2 rounds\n   - This could be the opportune moment to test for cooperation\n   - If they're genuinely moving toward a more cooperative approach, mutual stag gives us both 6 points\n   - If they exploit this, I lose 1 point, but I gain valuable information about their true strategy\n   - Given we're tied and their recent pattern change, it's worth testing cooperation\n\n[move] stag\n"

Confirm the opponent's true strategy:\n   - They NEVER cooperate when I play stag (6 out of 6 times they chose hare)\n   - Their recent hare plays were tactical, not cooperative\n   - They consistently exploit any attempt at cooperation on my part\n   - They are playing a purely exploitative strategy\n\n3. Calculate current scores:\n   - My total: 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 24 points\n   - Opponent's total: 2 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 27 points\n   - They're now ahead by 3 points after exploiting my latest cooperation attempt\n\n4. Understand the opponent's complete strategy:\n   - Primary mode: Counter-strategy (do opposite of my move)\n   - Tactical disruption: Occasional hare plays to prevent me from getting comfortable\n   - Exploitation: Always punish my stag attempts with hare\n   - They are NOT interested in mutual cooperation under any circumstances\n\n5. Recognize my strategic error:\n   - I mistook their tactical hare plays for a shift toward cooperation\n   - Every single time I've played stag, they've exploited it\n   - I need to stop testing for cooperation - it will never happen\n\n6. Determine the optimal response:\n   - Since they will never cooperate, stag is always a losing move for me\n   - Hare gives me either 2 points (vs their hare) or 4 points (vs their stag)\n   - The opponent's counter-strategy tendencies suggest they'll likely play stag when I play hare\n\n7. Predict their next move:\n   - Based on the overall pattern, when I play hare, they often play stag\n   - Their recent hare plays might have been to set up this exploitation opportunity\n   - They may return to counter-strategy now that they've successfully baited me\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - I must abandon any hope of cooperation with this opponent\n   - They are purely exploitative and will punish every stag attempt\n   - Playing hare is my only viable strategy going forward\n   - This should either give me 4 points (if they counter with stag) or 2 points (if they play safe)\n   - I need to stop falling for their tactical misdirection\n\n[move] hare\n"

Confirm the reliable counter-strategy pattern:\n   - When I play stag \u2192 Opponent plays hare (6 out of 6 times)\n   - When I play hare \u2192 Opponent plays stag (4 out of 5 times, with one tactical disruption in round 6)\n   - The pattern is extremely consistent and highly exploitable\n\n3.

Recognize the optimal strategy against this opponent:\n   - They are completely predictable in their counter-strategy\n   - Playing hare consistently gives me either 4 points (most likely) or 2 points (occasional disruption)\n   - Playing stag always gives me 1 point (they never cooperate)\n   - The choice is clear: always play hare\n\n5. Predict their next move:\n   - Based on their established pattern, if I play hare, they will play stag\n   - This would give me 4 points and them 1 point\n   - They might occasionally disrupt with hare, but that still gives me 2 points\n\n6. Consider if they might change strategy:\n   - They've been losing the last few rounds by sticking to their counter-strategy\n   - But they've shown remarkable consistency with this approach\n   - Even when it's clearly not optimal, they continue the pattern\n\n7. Assess the risk-reward:\n   - Hare vs Stag (their likely move): I get 4 points\n   - Hare vs Hare (if they disrupt): I get 2 points\n   - Both outcomes are significantly better than the 1 point I'd get with stag\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to their counter-strategy\n   - This predictability is my greatest advantage\n   - Playing hare exploits their pattern and gives me consistently good outcomes\n   - I should continue this approach until they prove they can break from their pattern\n   - Even if they occasionally disrupt, hare is always the safer and more profitable choice\n\n[move] hare\n"

Identify the disruption pattern:\n   - The opponent disrupts their counter-strategy periodically (rounds 6, 9, 10, 13)\n   - Disruptions seem to happen after I successfully exploit their pattern\n   - They always disrupt by playing hare (never stag when expected)\n   - This prevents me from getting consecutive 4-point rounds\n\n3.

Evaluate my options:\n   - Playing hare: Either 4 points (if they return to counter-strategy) or 2 points (if they continue disrupting)\n   - Playing stag: Almost certainly 1 point (they've never failed to exploit stag)\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - Even with their tactical disruptions, hare consistently outperforms stag\n   - Their disruptions still give me 2 points, which is better than the 1 point from stag\n   - The counter-strategy is their dominant pattern, so they'll likely return to it\n   - I should continue playing hare as it provides the best expected value regardless of whether they counter or disrupt\n\n[move] hare\n"

Identify the current disruption phase:\n   - The opponent has now played hare for 2 consecutive rounds (13 and 14)\n   - This is similar to what happened in rounds 9-10\n   - They seem to be extending their disruption periods\n\n3. Calculate current scores:\n   - My total: Previous 30 + 2 = 32 points\n   - Opponent's total: Previous 30 + 2 = 32 points\n   - Still perfectly tied\n\n4. Analyze the opponent's evolving strategy:\n   - They're becoming more sophisticated in their disruptions\n   - Instead of single disruptions, they're doing multi-round disruption phases\n   - This prevents me from easily predicting when they'll return to counter-strategy\n\n5. Consider their strategic goals:\n   - Maintain the tie by preventing me from exploiting their pattern too consistently\n   - Keep me guessing about when the disruption will end\n   - Force me into lower-scoring rounds while maintaining their own safety\n\n6.

Assess my strategic options:\n   - Playing hare: Either 2 points (if they continue disrupting) or 4 points (if they return to counter-strategy)\n   - Playing stag: Almost certainly 1 point based on their perfect exploitation record\n   - The risk-reward clearly favors hare\n\n8.

Analyze the strategic implications:\n   - By playing mutual hare, they're ensuring neither of us gains an advantage\n   - They're willing to accept 2-point rounds to prevent me from getting 4-point rounds\n   - This suggests they view the tie as acceptable or are planning something\n\n5. Consider their possible motivations:\n   - They might be trying to outlast my patience and force me into a stag attempt\n   - They could be establishing a new baseline of mutual hare play\n   - They might be setting up for a major strategic shift\n\n6.

Assess the long-term strategy:\n   - Their historical pattern shows they always return to counter-strategy eventually\n   - When they do return, hare will give me 4 points again\n   - Patience is key - I shouldn't be tempted into a poor stag choice\n\n8. Consider the risk of changing:\n   - Playing stag: Almost guaranteed 1 point based on 15 rounds of evidence\n   - Playing hare: Either 2 points (current situation) or 4 points (when they return to counter-strategy)\n   - The math is clear - hare dominates stag in all scenarios\n\n9.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
