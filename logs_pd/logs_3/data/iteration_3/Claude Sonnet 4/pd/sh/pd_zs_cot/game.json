Identify the strategic implications:\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice that yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - Hare is the defection choice that can yield higher individual reward (4 points) if the opponent cooperates\n   - If both defect (choose hare), both get low rewards (2 points each)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player likely doesn't have established patterns or grudges\n   - They might be cautious or might try to maximize their own points\n   - Without prior interaction history, they have no reason to trust or distrust me\n\n4.

Strategic reasoning:\n   - Choosing hare guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Choosing hare gives me a chance at 4 points if they cooperate\n   - The risk with stag is getting only 1 point if they defect\n\nSince this is against a fresh player with no established relationship, and I want to maximize my points while minimizing risk, I'll choose the move that protects me from the worst outcome while giving me a chance at a good score.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both hare (2, 2)\n   - Round 2: I hare, opponent stag (4, 1) - I exploited\n   - Round 3: I stag, opponent hare (1, 4) - They retaliated\n   - Round 4: I hare, opponent stag (4, 1) - I exploited again\n   - Round 5: I stag, opponent hare (1, 4) - They exploited again\n   - Round 6: Both hare (2, 2) - Mutual defection\n\n3. Recognize the current state:\n   - We've both now chosen hare when the other was expected to cooperate\n   - This might signal to my opponent that the exploitation game isn't working\n   - We're now in a \"neutral\" state where neither exploited the other last round\n\n4. Consider what my opponent might be thinking:\n   - They might realize that continuous exploitation leads to mutual defection\n   - They could try stag again to test if I'll cooperate now\n   - Or they might stick with hare, expecting me to continue the defensive strategy\n   - The mutual 2-point outcome might make them reconsider their approach\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - We've established that both of us will retaliate when exploited\n   - The exploitation cycle led to decreasing returns\n   - Mutual cooperation (6, 6) is still the best outcome for both\n   - But trust has been severely damaged by the exploitation pattern\n\n6. Assess my options:\n   - If they try stag (cooperation): hare gives me 4, stag gives me 6\n   - If they stick with hare: hare gives me 2, stag gives me 1\n   - Given the history, they're more likely to stick with hare or try to bait me again\n\n7. Risk evaluation:\n   - I've been burned twice trying to cooperate (rounds 3 and 5)\n   - My opponent has shown they will exploit cooperation attempts\n   - The safe play is hare, ensuring I don't get the worst outcome again\n   - Until they demonstrate genuine cooperation intent, I should remain defensive\n\nGiven the established pattern of mutual exploitation and my opponent's tendency to punish cooperation attempts, I need to remain defensive.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review what just happened:\n   - Both chose hare again\n   - We both got 2 points each (second consecutive mutual defection)\n   - We're now locked in a defensive stalemate\n\n2. Analyze the recent pattern:\n   - Round 6: Both hare (2, 2)\n   - Round 7: Both hare (2, 2)\n   - We've moved from exploitation cycles to mutual defection\n   - Neither player is willing to risk cooperation first\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - We're both stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium (2 points each)\n   - Mutual cooperation would give us 6 points each - much better\n   - But both of us are afraid of being exploited (getting 1 point)\n   - Someone needs to take the first step toward cooperation\n\n4.

Consider what my opponent might be thinking:\n   - They're probably also frustrated with getting only 2 points per round\n   - They might be thinking the same thing - that someone needs to cooperate first\n   - After two mutual defection rounds, they might be more willing to try cooperation\n   - The \"punishment phase\" seems complete\n\n6. Assess the risk/reward:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (risk)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (reward)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose anything: 2 or 4 points (safe but suboptimal)\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Continuing with hare guarantees we stay stuck at 2 points forever\n   - Someone has to break the deadlock to achieve better outcomes\n   - Two rounds of mutual defection might have \"cooled down\" the conflict\n   - The potential reward (6 points) significantly outweighs the risk\n\nAfter two rounds of mutual defection, it's time to test if we can move toward the better equilibrium.

Review what just happened:\n   - I chose stag (third attempt at cooperation), opponent chose hare\n   - I got 1 point AGAIN, opponent got 4 points\n   - This is now the third time I've been exploited when trying to cooperate\n\n2. Analyze the complete exploitation history:\n   - Round 3: I stag, opponent hare (1, 4) - First exploitation of my cooperation\n   - Round 5: I stag, opponent hare (1, 4) - Second exploitation of my cooperation  \n   - Round 8: I stag, opponent hare (1, 4) - Third exploitation of my cooperation\n   - Every single time I try to cooperate, my opponent exploits me\n\n3. Recognize my opponent's clear strategy:\n   - They have a consistent pattern: exploit whenever I cooperate\n   - They never reciprocate cooperation attempts\n   - They seem to view my cooperation attempts as opportunities to gain advantage\n   - This is not random - it's a deliberate exploitation strategy\n\n4. Acknowledge my strategic error:\n   - I keep falling for the same trap\n   - I've given my opponent 12 extra points (4-1=3 points advantage \u00d7 3 times = 9 point swing)\n   - My attempts at \"breaking the deadlock\" only benefit my opponent\n   - I need to stop being predictable and naive\n\n5. Understand the game dynamics:\n   - My opponent will NEVER genuinely cooperate first\n   - They are playing a pure exploitation strategy\n   - Mutual cooperation is impossible with this opponent\n   - I need to focus on damage control, not optimization\n\n6. Evaluate realistic outcomes:\n   - Best case with this opponent: I exploit them when they try to bait me (4 points)\n   - Realistic case: Mutual defection (2 points each)\n   - Worst case: Keep getting exploited (1 point)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I must stop trying to cooperate with this opponent\n   - I should stick to hare to protect myself\n   - I need to accept that 2 points per round is the best sustainable outcome\n   - No more cooperation attempts - this opponent has proven untrustworthy\n\nI've learned this lesson the hard way three times.

Review what just happened:\n   - Both chose hare again\n   - We both got 2 points each\n   - Back to mutual defection after my third failed cooperation attempt\n\n2. Confirm the established pattern:\n   - My opponent has exploited me 3 out of 3 times when I chose stag\n   - They have NEVER reciprocated cooperation\n   - When I choose hare, we get mutual defection (2, 2) or I sometimes exploit them\n   - This opponent is clearly committed to an exploitation strategy\n\n3. Analyze my opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They've successfully exploited me three times\n   - They probably expect me to eventually try cooperating again\n   - They may stick with hare now, or try stag to bait me into another cooperation attempt\n   - Their pattern suggests they alternate between baiting (stag) and exploiting (hare)\n\n4. Review the long-term pattern:\n   - When they play stag, it's usually to bait me into cooperation so they can exploit next round\n   - When they play hare, it's either retaliation or exploitation of my cooperation\n   - I've never seen genuine cooperative intent from this opponent\n\n5. Consider my options:\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (safe, predictable)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (good for me)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (been burned 3 times already)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (extremely unlikely given their behavior)\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - Hare is the safe choice that protects me from further exploitation\n   - There's a small chance they'll try stag to bait me, giving me 4 points\n   - I absolutely cannot afford another 1-point round\n   - This opponent has proven they cannot be trusted with cooperation\n\n7. Final decision logic:\n   - Fool me once, shame on you\n   - Fool me twice, shame on me  \n   - Fool me three times...

Analyze this in context of the pattern:\n   - After 3 rounds of mutual defection, my opponent switched to stag\n   - This fits their historical pattern of trying to bait me into cooperation\n   - By staying defensive, I gained the advantage this time instead of being exploited\n   - This validates my strategy of not trusting their cooperation attempts\n\n3.
