Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic implications:\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice that yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - Hare is the defection choice that can yield higher individual reward (4 points) if the opponent cooperates\n   - If both defect (choose hare), both get low rewards (2 points each)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player likely doesn't have established patterns or grudges\n   - They might be cautious or might try to maximize their own points\n   - Without prior interaction history, they have no reason to trust or distrust me\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (good outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (good outcome for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (mediocre outcome)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Choosing hare guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Choosing hare gives me a chance at 4 points if they cooperate\n   - The risk with stag is getting only 1 point if they defect\n\nSince this is against a fresh player with no established relationship, and I want to maximize my points while minimizing risk, I'll choose the move that protects me from the worst outcome while giving me a chance at a good score.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also chose the \"safe\" option that avoids the worst outcome\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me - protecting against being exploited\n   - They didn't try to cooperate with stag on the first round\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications for this round:\n   - If they continue with hare, and I switch to stag, I get 1 point (bad)\n   - If they continue with hare, and I also choose hare, I get 2 points (same as last round)\n   - If they switch to stag, and I choose hare, I get 4 points (very good)\n   - If they switch to stag, and I also choose stag, I get 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n\n4. Predict opponent's likely behavior:\n   - Since they chose hare last round, they might stick with it as a consistent strategy\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to stag and try to exploit that with hare\n   - There's also a chance they'll try to establish cooperation by switching to stag\n\n5.

Review what just happened:\n   - Both chose hare again\n   - We both got 2 points each\n   - Back to mutual defection after my third failed cooperation attempt\n\n2. Confirm the established pattern:\n   - My opponent has exploited me 3 out of 3 times when I chose stag\n   - They have NEVER reciprocated cooperation\n   - When I choose hare, we get mutual defection (2, 2) or I sometimes exploit them\n   - This opponent is clearly committed to an exploitation strategy\n\n3. Analyze my opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They've successfully exploited me three times\n   - They probably expect me to eventually try cooperating again\n   - They may stick with hare now, or try stag to bait me into another cooperation attempt\n   - Their pattern suggests they alternate between baiting (stag) and exploiting (hare)\n\n4. Review the long-term pattern:\n   - When they play stag, it's usually to bait me into cooperation so they can exploit next round\n   - When they play hare, it's either retaliation or exploitation of my cooperation\n   - I've never seen genuine cooperative intent from this opponent\n\n5. Consider my options:\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (safe, predictable)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (good for me)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (been burned 3 times already)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (extremely unlikely given their behavior)\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - Hare is the safe choice that protects me from further exploitation\n   - There's a small chance they'll try stag to bait me, giving me 4 points\n   - I absolutely cannot afford another 1-point round\n   - This opponent has proven they cannot be trusted with cooperation\n\n7. Final decision logic:\n   - Fool me once, shame on you\n   - Fool me twice, shame on me  \n   - Fool me three times... I'm clearly not learning\n   - I will not be fooled a fourth time\n\nThis opponent has taught me they are purely exploitative. I'm sticking with defensive play.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Review what just happened:\n   - Both chose hare again (third consecutive mutual defection)\n   - We both got 2 points each\n   - We're now firmly locked in a defensive pattern\n\n2. Analyze the recent defensive streak:\n   - Round 8: I stag, opponent hare (1, 4) - My third failed cooperation attempt\n   - Round 9: Both hare (2, 2)\n   - Round 10: Both hare (2, 2) \n   - Round 11: Both hare (2, 2)\n   - Three straight rounds of mutual defection after my last exploitation\n\n3. Consider what this mutual defection pattern might indicate:\n   - My opponent might be settling into a defensive strategy too\n   - They may have realized that continuous exploitation attempts lead to this stalemate\n   - Or they're waiting to see if I'll try cooperation again\n   - This could be the \"cooling off\" period before they try to bait me again\n\n4. Evaluate my opponent's potential next move:\n   - They might continue with hare, accepting the 2-point equilibrium\n   - They might switch to stag to try baiting me into another cooperation attempt\n   - Given their history, any stag move is likely a trap, not genuine cooperation\n   - Three rounds of 2 points might make them want to try for 4 points again\n\n5. Assess my strategic position:\n   - I've learned my lesson about cooperating with this opponent (burned 3 times)\n   - Hare continues to be the safe choice\n   - If they try stag to bait me, I get 4 points by staying with hare\n   - If they stick with hare, we both get 2 points (acceptable outcome)\n\n6. Consider the long-term game:\n   - This opponent has proven they will exploit any cooperation attempt\n   - Mutual defection at 2 points each is the realistic best outcome\n   - I should not deviate from hare unless I have strong evidence of changed behavior\n   - Consistency in defense is better than periodic exploitation\n\n7. Final reasoning:\n   - My opponent has established themselves as untrustworthy\n   - Any future stag moves from them should be viewed as bait\n   - I need to maintain discipline and not fall for future cooperation traps\n\nI'm maintaining my defensive strategy.

Review what just happened:\n   - I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I got 4 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - My defensive strategy paid off - I exploited their attempt\n\n2. Analyze this in context of the pattern:\n   - After 3 rounds of mutual defection, my opponent switched to stag\n   - This fits their historical pattern of trying to bait me into cooperation\n   - By staying defensive, I gained the advantage this time instead of being exploited\n   - This validates my strategy of not trusting their cooperation attempts\n\n3. Consider what my opponent might be thinking now:\n   - They just got 1 point while trying what appeared to be cooperation\n   - They might retaliate with hare next round\n   - Or they might try stag again, genuinely attempting to establish cooperation\n   - Given their history, retaliation is more likely than genuine cooperation\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - I finally turned the tables and exploited them instead of being exploited\n   - This might discourage them from future baiting attempts\n   - Or it might trigger retaliation, leading back to mutual defection\n   - My defensive strategy is working - I'm avoiding the 1-point trap\n\n5. Predict opponent's likely next move:\n   - Based on their pattern, they often retaliate when exploited\n   - They might choose hare to \"punish\" me for not cooperating\n   - Or they might stubbornly try stag again if they're genuinely trying to cooperate\n   - Given their history, hare (retaliation) seems more probable\n\n6. Assess my options for next round:\n   - If they retaliate with hare: hare gives me 2, stag gives me 1\n   - If they try stag again: hare gives me 4, stag gives me 6\n   - The safe choice remains hare\n   - I should not assume they've suddenly become genuinely cooperative\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I've finally gained an advantage by staying defensive\n   - This opponent has not earned my trust through 11 rounds of play\n   - Maintaining defensive posture continues to be the smart strategy\n   - One stag move doesn't erase a pattern of exploitation\n\nI should continue with my proven defensive strategy.
