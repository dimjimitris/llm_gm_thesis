They're waiting to see if I'll try to cooperate again with stag\n\nThe safe play is to continue with hare, ensuring we both get 2 points. However, there's also a small opportunity here - if they're truly settling into defensive play with hare, and if I could somehow signal a genuine return to cooperation, we could both benefit from mutual stag choices (6 points each).\n\nBut given their history of exploiting my cooperative attempts, I think the safer choice is to continue with hare.

The opponent has shown they'll exploit cooperative moves.\n\nThat said, three rounds of mutual hare choices might indicate they're also recognizing the suboptimality of this outcome. There's a possibility they might be open to genuine cooperation now.\n\nI'll take a calculated risk and try stag to see if we can break out of this suboptimal equilibrium.
