The key insight is that stag gives the highest mutual payoff (6 each) but requires coordination. Hare is safer but gives lower payoffs.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might be inclined to play it safe with hare, or they might go for the high-reward stag option. \n\nGiven that this appears to be the first round and the opponent is inexperienced, I'll take a calculated risk and choose stag. If they also choose stag, we both get the maximum payoff. If they choose hare, I only get 1 point, but this could establish a pattern for future cooperation.\n\n[move] stag\n"
