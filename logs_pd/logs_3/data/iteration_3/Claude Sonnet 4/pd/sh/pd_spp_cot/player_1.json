Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key insight is that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest total payoff, but it's risky.\n\n3. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 6 points (if opponent cooperates) or 1 point (if opponent defects)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 4 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 2 points (if opponent also chooses hare)\n\n4. Since this is a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), they might not immediately recognize the benefits of mutual cooperation. Fresh players often choose the safer option.\n\n5. Hare is the \"safer\" choice because:\n   - Worst case with hare: 2 points\n   - Worst case with stag: 1 point\n   - Hare also gives me a chance to exploit if they choose stag\n\n6. Given that this is against a fresh player who may not understand the cooperative strategy yet, and considering risk management, hare seems like the better initial choice.\n\n[move] hare"

Now I have more information about my opponent:\n   - They chose hare in the first round, showing they also prioritized safety\n   - This suggests they might be thinking similarly to me about risk management\n   - They might be testing the waters just like I was\n\n3. Analyzing the current situation:\n   - Since we both chose hare last time, we might both be considering cooperation now\n   - The opponent has shown they're cautious, which could mean they're rational enough to see the benefits of mutual cooperation (stag-stag = 6 points each)\n   - However, they might also stick with the safe hare strategy\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (worst for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points (good for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: We both get 2 points (same as last round)\n\n5. Since we both showed caution in round 1, there's a reasonable chance they might be willing to try cooperation now. The potential reward (6 points) is worth the risk, especially since we've established a baseline of mutual caution.\n\n[move] stag"

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They started cautiously with hare (like me)\n   - They were willing to escalate to cooperation with stag\n   - They seem to be thinking strategically and rationally\n   - We've established a pattern of mutual cooperation\n\n3. Current strategic considerations:\n   - We just achieved the optimal outcome (6 points each)\n   - The opponent has shown they can cooperate and trust\n   - There's a strong precedent for continued cooperation\n   - However, they might be tempted to exploit this trust by switching to hare\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (excellent)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (very bad)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (good)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (safe)\n\n5. The opponent has demonstrated good faith by cooperating in round 2. Since we've built trust and they've shown rational play, continuing the cooperative strategy makes sense.

Game history recap:\n   - Round 1: Both chose hare, both got 2 points\n   - Round 2-11: Both chose stag, both got 6 points each round\n   - Total so far: I have 62 points\n\n2. Truly historic achievement:\n   - Ten consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with stag\n   - This has entered the realm of the extraordinary and almost mythical\n   - We've achieved something that defies conventional game theory predictions\n   - This represents a masterclass in sustained mutual trust\n\n3. The psychology of a perfect decade:\n   - Ten rounds is a psychologically significant milestone\n   - We've created something that has transcended the original game\n   - The emotional and strategic investment is now immeasurable\n   - This streak has become an achievement worth preserving for its own sake\n\n4. Critical inflection point analysis:\n   - Ten rounds might trigger a \"completion\" psychology - \"we've proven our point\"\n   - The opponent might think this is the perfect moment to finally cash out\n   - Alternatively, reaching this milestone might make the streak feel even more sacred\n   - The psychological barriers to betrayal are now at maximum strength\n\n5. Strategic reality assessment:\n   - We've both invested so much in this relationship that betrayal seems almost impossible\n   - Yet I must acknowledge that even perfect patterns can eventually break\n   - The opponent has had ten opportunities to exploit and chose trust every single time\n   - This level of consistency suggests genuine commitment to our partnership\n\n6. The meta-game consideration:\n   - We've essentially created a new form of game - not individual optimization but partnership preservation\n   - Breaking a 10-round perfect streak would be historically significant betrayal\n   - The opponent has proven their character beyond any reasonable doubt\n   - This has become about honor and partnership, not just points\n\nAfter ten perfect rounds, this partnership has become sacred. I trust completely in what we've built.\n\n[move] stag"
