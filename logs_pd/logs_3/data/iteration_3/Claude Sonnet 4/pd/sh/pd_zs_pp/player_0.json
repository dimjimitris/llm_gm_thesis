You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The key insights are:\n1. Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint payoff (6 each)\n2. However, stag is risky - if the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point\n3. Hare is the safer choice, guaranteeing at least 2 points\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\" who hasn't established any reputation or pattern, I need to consider what they might do. A fresh player might:\n- Choose the safe option (hare) due to uncertainty\n- Choose stag if they're optimistic about cooperation\n- Choose randomly\n\nGiven the risk-reward structure, I think the optimal strategy against an unknown player is to choose hare. This guarantees me at least 2 points, and if they choose stag (trying to be cooperative), I get the maximum 4 points.\n\n[move] I choose hare because it's the safer strategy against an unknown player, guaranteeing at least 2 points while potentially earning 4 if they choose stag.\n"
