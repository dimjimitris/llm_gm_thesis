    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The potential reward of mutual cooperation (6 points each) outweighs the risk, especially since we want to maximize points. I'll choose Stag as a cooperative opening move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Choose Stag - this maximizes potential points through cooperation and signals good faith to the other player.\n\n[move] I choose Stag.

The opponent chose hare while we chose stag, giving us only 1 point while they got 4. This tells us several things:\n1. The opponent is either risk-averse or strategic\n2. They may have predicted we'd cooperate and exploited it\n3. They might continue this pattern if they think we're \"cooperative types\"\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** This is crucial information about our opponent. They revealed they're willing to defect when they expect cooperation. Now we have two main options:\n1. Punish their defection by choosing hare (ensuring they get at most 2 points)\n2. Try cooperation again to see if they'll reciprocate now that they've \"won\" once\n\nGiven they showed they'll exploit cooperation, the rational response is to choose hare to protect ourselves.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're right. They've shown they're willing to take advantage of cooperative moves. If I choose stag again, they might expect it and choose hare again for another 4 points. If I choose hare, the worst I can do is get 2 points, and if they choose stag thinking I'll cooperate again, I'll get 4 points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly. In repeated games, you often need to establish that defection has consequences. By choosing hare now, we either:\n1. Get 4 points if they choose stag (thinking we'll cooperate again)\n2. Get 2 points if they also choose hare (mutual defection)\nEither outcome is better than the 1 point we just received.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst:** This is a classic \"tit-for-tat\" response. We cooperated first, they defected, so now we defect to show that exploitation has consequences. This might encourage future cooperation if there are more rounds.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The logic is sound. I'll switch to hare to protect against further exploitation and potentially punish their previous defection.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Choose Hare - protect against exploitation and potentially punish their previous defection.\n\n[move] (They exploited my cooperation last round, so now I need to protect myself and show that defection has consequences) hare\n"
