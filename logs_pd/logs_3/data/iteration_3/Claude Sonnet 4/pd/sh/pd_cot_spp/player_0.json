Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with intuition\n   - They might be risk-averse or risk-seeking\n\n3. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 6 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Stag is high-risk, high-reward: potential for 6 points but risk of only 1 point\n   - Hare is safer: guaranteed at least 2 points, with potential for 4 points\n\n5. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" who might be unpredictable and possibly risk-averse, they might lean toward the safer hare option. However, they might also see the appeal of the mutual cooperation (stag-stag) for maximum joint benefit.\n\n6. Given that I want to maximize my points and a fresh player's behavior is uncertain, I should choose the move that gives me the best expected outcome while protecting against the worst case.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare because it provides better protection against uncertainty - I'm guaranteed at least 2 points and have a good chance of getting 4 points if the fresh player chooses the cooperative stag option.\n\n[move] hare"

Previous round analysis:\n   - Both the opponent and I chose hare\n   - This suggests the opponent might also be thinking defensively/safely\n   - The opponent showed they're not necessarily going for the high-risk stag option\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They might be risk-averse like I was\n   - They could be thinking similarly about protecting against uncertainty\n   - Or they might have chosen hare for the same strategic reasons I did\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If my opponent continues the same safe strategy, they'll likely choose hare again\n   - If they learned from the previous round and think I'll choose hare again, they might switch to stag to try to get 4 points\n   - If they think cooperatively, they might choose stag hoping I'll do the same for mutual 6 points\n\n4. My options analysis:\n   - If I stick with hare: Safe 2 points if they choose hare, or 4 points if they choose stag\n   - If I switch to stag: 6 points if they choose stag, or only 1 point if they choose hare\n\n5. Risk vs reward assessment:\n   - The opponent showed cautious behavior in round 1\n   - But now they have information about my choice too\n   - They might reason that I'll stick with the safe hare choice\n   - This could make them more likely to choose stag to exploit my expected hare choice\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - Since my opponent also chose hare last round, they might be thinking I'll do the same\n   - This creates an opportunity for me to switch to stag and potentially get 4 points if they choose hare\n   - However, if they're thinking the same way, we might both switch to stag and get the mutual benefit of 6 points\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to stag this round. The opponent's previous hare choice suggests they might expect me to play hare again, giving me a chance to get 4 points. And if they're also thinking strategically about cooperation, we could both benefit with 6 points each.\n\n[move] stag"

Pattern recognition:\n   - My opponent and I have chosen the same move both times\n   - This suggests we might be thinking similarly or the opponent is mirroring my strategy\n   - We've now experienced both outcomes of mutual cooperation\n\n3. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They switched from hare to stag just like I did\n   - They might be reasoning through the same strategic considerations\n   - They could be adapting their strategy based on previous rounds\n   - They seem willing to take risks when the situation calls for it\n\n4. Opponent's possible thinking for this round:\n   - They might think: \"We both got 6 points with stag, let's stick with it\"\n   - Or they might think: \"They'll expect me to choose stag again, so I'll switch to hare to get 4 points\"\n   - Or they might reason: \"The pattern shows we're both strategic, so continued cooperation makes sense\"\n\n5. My strategic options:\n   - Stick with stag: 6 points if they choose stag, 1 point if they choose hare\n   - Switch to hare: 4 points if they choose stag, 2 points if they choose hare\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - The opponent has shown they can think strategically (switching from hare to stag)\n   - Since we both benefited maximally last round, there's incentive to maintain cooperation\n   - However, they might try to exploit if they think I'll stick with stag\n   - The safest approach might be to assume they'll stick with what worked (stag)\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - We've established a pattern of mutual benefit\n   - The opponent has demonstrated they can make strategic switches\n   - Continued cooperation with stag gives us both the maximum joint benefit\n   - Breaking this cooperation would be risky and potentially less rewarding\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag again.

Pattern recognition:\n   - We've now had two consecutive rounds of mutual stag cooperation\n   - The opponent has consistently matched my strategic thinking\n   - We've established a stable cooperative equilibrium\n   - Both players are benefiting maximally from this arrangement\n\n3. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They clearly understand the value of cooperation\n   - They're not trying to exploit the situation for short-term gain\n   - They seem committed to the mutually beneficial strategy\n   - They've shown consistency in maintaining cooperation once established\n\n4. Temptation analysis:\n   - There might be temptation to switch to hare to try to get 4 points while they stick with stag\n   - However, this would be a betrayal of the established cooperation\n   - If they're thinking similarly, they might also be tempted to defect\n   - Breaking cooperation could lead to both of us getting worse outcomes\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - The current strategy is working perfectly - we're both getting maximum points\n   - Any deviation risks destroying the cooperative relationship\n   - The opponent has shown they value long-term cooperation over short-term exploitation\n   - Maintaining trust is crucial for continued mutual benefit\n\n6.

Pattern solidification:\n   - We've now had three consecutive rounds of mutual stag cooperation\n   - This is no longer just a pattern - it's become a stable strategy\n   - The opponent has consistently demonstrated commitment to cooperation\n   - We've achieved the optimal outcome repeatedly\n\n3. Psychological considerations:\n   - After this many successful cooperative rounds, both players likely expect stag\n   - The trust level is very high at this point\n   - Breaking cooperation now would be particularly surprising and potentially damaging\n   - The opponent has had multiple opportunities to defect but hasn't\n\n4. Strategic temptation analysis:\n   - The very predictability of our cooperation might create temptation to exploit\n   - If I think \"they definitely expect me to choose stag,\" I might consider hare for 4 points\n   - However, the opponent might be thinking the exact same thing\n   - This could lead to mutual defection and only 2 points each\n\n5. Game theory considerations:\n   - We've reached what appears to be a stable Nash equilibrium\n   - Both players are maximizing their outcomes given the other's strategy\n   - Any unilateral deviation would result in a worse outcome for the deviator\n   - The repeated nature of the game reinforces cooperative behavior\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Risk of staying with stag: Minimal - worst case is still 6 points if opponent cooperates, 1 point if they defect\n   - Risk of switching to hare: Could get 4 points but risk destroying established cooperation\n   - Expected value strongly favors continuing cooperation\n\n7. Long-term vs short-term thinking:\n   - Short-term: Switching to hare could yield 4 points this round\n   - Long-term: Maintaining cooperation ensures 6 points per round indefinitely\n   - The opponent has shown they think long-term too\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with stag.

Psychological dynamics:\n   - At this point, both players likely have very high confidence in continued cooperation\n   - The predictability might actually make the cooperation stronger, not weaker\n   - Breaking this pattern would be shocking and potentially relationship-ending\n   - The opponent has had numerous opportunities to exploit but consistently chooses cooperation\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - The temptation to defect might actually be lower now due to the established trust\n   - Both players understand we've found the optimal solution\n   - Any deviation would likely lead to retaliation and worse outcomes for both\n   - The cooperative equilibrium is self-reinforcing\n\n5.

Strategic reliability:\n   - The opponent has proven to be completely trustworthy over multiple rounds\n   - There's been zero deviation from cooperation once it was established\n   - This level of consistency suggests a player who understands long-term optimization\n   - The predictability has become a strength, not a weakness\n\n4. Temptation resistance analysis:\n   - If there was going to be a betrayal, it likely would have happened by now\n   - The longer the cooperation continues, the more costly betrayal becomes\n   - Both players have invested heavily in this cooperative relationship\n   - Breaking it now would sacrifice all future potential gains\n\n5. Game theory implications:\n   - We've achieved what's called a \"cooperative equilibrium\" in repeated games\n   - Both players are using what's known as a \"tit-for-tat\" or \"always cooperate\" strategy\n   - This is actually the mathematically optimal solution for repeated games\n   - The shadow of future interactions reinforces current cooperation\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Risk of continuing cooperation: Virtually zero - pattern is extremely stable\n   - Risk of defection: Very high - would likely trigger retaliation and end cooperation\n   - Expected value: Continuing cooperation gives near-certain 6 points\n   - The established trust makes stag the dominant strategy\n\n7.
