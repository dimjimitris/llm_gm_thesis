    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag is high-risk, high-reward (6 or 1 points)\n   - Choosing hare is more consistent (4 or 2 points, both better than the worst stag outcome)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against an unpredictable fresh player, the safer choice of hare gives me a guaranteed minimum of 2 points\n   - If they choose stag (which they might do randomly), I get 4 points\n   - This minimizes my risk while still giving good upside\n\n[move] I choose hare\n"

Consider the opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They chose stag in the first round, showing they might be aiming for the high cooperative payoff\n   - Since they got only 1 point while I got 4, they might reconsider their strategy\n   - They could either switch to hare to avoid being exploited, or stick with stag hoping I'll cooperate\n\n3. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they switch to hare: I get 1 point (bad for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag again: I get 4 points again\n   - If I choose hare and they switch to hare: I get 2 points\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - The opponent showed willingness to cooperate initially\n   - After being exploited once, they might be more cautious\n   - However, they might also try stag again if they think I'll reciprocate\n   - Playing hare again is safer but less rewarding if they stick with stag\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Since they chose stag once, there's a reasonable chance they might do it again\n   - The risk-reward favors hare again: guaranteed 2+ points vs potential 1 point loss\n\n[move] (Opponent showed cooperative tendency with stag, so hare continues to be the safer choice with good upside) hare\n"
