Evaluate strategic options going forward:\n   - The reliable pattern is gone, so I need to adapt\n   - They might continue with more hares or return to some pattern\n   - Hare remains the safer choice (guarantees 2+ points)\n   - Stag is riskier but could pay off if they stick with hare\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Since they broke their pattern and chose hare unexpectedly, they might continue with hare\n   - If they choose hare again and I choose hare: 2 points (safe)\n   - If they choose stag and I choose hare: 4 points (good)\n   - Hare continues to be the smart choice given the uncertainty\n\n[move] (My opponent just broke their predictable pattern by choosing hare instead of the expected stag, so with this new uncertainty I'll stick with hare as the safer option) hare\n"

Previous round analysis:\n   - Both players chose hare\n   - We both got 2 points each\n   - This confirms the opponent also played safely\n\n2. Updated information about my opponent:\n   - They also chose the safe option (hare)\n   - This suggests they might be risk-averse or thinking similarly to me\n   - They might continue with the safe strategy\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If they stick with hare again, choosing stag would give me only 1 point\n   - If they stick with hare again, choosing hare gives me 2 points (same as last round)\n   - If they switch to stag, choosing hare gives me 4 points\n   - If they switch to stag, choosing stag gives me 6 points\n\n4. Opponent behavior prediction:\n   - They played safe in round 1\n   - They might realize that mutual cooperation (stag) gives higher payoff\n   - Or they might stick with the safe hare strategy\n\n5. Risk vs reward analysis:\n   - Stag: High risk (1 point if opponent chooses hare) but high reward (6 points if opponent chooses stag)\n   - Hare: Medium risk, consistent reward (2-4 points)\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Since opponent showed risk-averse behavior, I'll continue with hare\n   - This maintains my guaranteed minimum while capitalizing if they switch to stag\n\n[move] (Continuing with the safe strategy since opponent also played conservatively last round) hare\n"

Statistical assessment:\n   - Opponent's hare strategy has been unwavering for 9 rounds\n   - My stag attempts (rounds 3, 6, 10) were all punished with 1 point\n   - The predictability is now near 100%\n\n3. Strategic consideration:\n   - We're deeply locked in a stable equilibrium\n   - Both players getting consistent 2 points per round\n   - The opponent shows absolutely no signs of changing strategy\n\n4. Alternative perspective:\n   - Sometimes in long games, players get bored with repetitive patterns\n   - After 9 rounds of hare, opponent might consider changing\n   - But their behavior suggests extreme risk aversion\n\n5. Cost-benefit analysis:\n   - Continuing hare: guaranteed 2 points\n   - Trying stag: very high probability of 1 point, tiny chance of 6 points\n   - The expected value strongly favors hare\n\n6. Final decision:\n   - The opponent has demonstrated complete commitment to hare\n   - No rational reason to break from the successful pattern\n   - Maintain the steady, predictable outcome\n\n[move] (Opponent unchanged for 9 consecutive rounds, maintaining the established equilibrium) hare\n"

Statistical confidence:\n   - 10 consecutive hare choices by opponent\n   - Zero deviation from this strategy in over two-thirds of the game\n   - Opponent's behavior is highly predictable at this point\n\n3.

Risk assessment:\n   - Any deviation to stag has historically resulted in 1 point for me\n   - The opponent has never rewarded my cooperation attempts\n   - Expected value of stag is far below hare at this point\n\n6.
