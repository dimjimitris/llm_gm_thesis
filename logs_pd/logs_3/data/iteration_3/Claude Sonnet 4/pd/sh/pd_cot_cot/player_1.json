Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Last 5 rounds (5, 6, 7, 8, 9): opponent chose hare every time\n   - We've been locked in hare-hare outcomes for the last 4 rounds\n   - Opponent seems to have completely abandoned stag strategy\n\n3. Strategic assessment:\n   - The opponent appears to be playing it extremely safe now\n   - They might be thinking I'll eventually try stag again and want to exploit it\n   - Or they're content with the guaranteed 2 points per round\n\n4. Game theory consideration:\n   - Both players choosing hare indefinitely gives us both steady 2 points\n   - But the optimal outcome (6 points each) requires mutual cooperation with stag\n   - The opponent might be waiting for me to signal cooperation\n\n5. Breaking the deadlock analysis:\n   - If I choose stag and opponent sticks with hare: I get 1 point (bad)\n   - If I choose stag and opponent also chooses stag: we both get 6 points (optimal)\n   - The risk is significant but the reward could be worth it\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - We're stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium\n   - The opponent might be ready to cooperate if I show trust\n   - Taking the risk to break the pattern could lead to the optimal outcome\n   - Even if it fails once, it might signal my willingness to cooperate\n\n[move] (Breaking the safe pattern to signal cooperation and attempt the optimal mutual outcome) stag\n"

My strategic position:\n   - Every stag attempt has been punished with 1 point\n   - My best outcomes (4 points) came when opponent chose stag and I chose hare\n   - But opponent hasn't chosen stag since round 4\n\n5.
