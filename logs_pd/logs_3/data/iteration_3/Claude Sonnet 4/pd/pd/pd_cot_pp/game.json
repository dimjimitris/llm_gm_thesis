Analyze what the opponent is likely thinking:\n   - They probably expect this cooperation to eventually lead to mutual cooperation\n   - Then they can exploit again for another 6-point gain\n   - They're playing a long-term exploitation strategy disguised as forgiveness\n   - They benefit from appearing cooperative while being fundamentally exploitative\n\n4. Consider my strategic position:\n   - I now have 34 points total, which is quite good\n   - The opponent keeps offering opportunities for me to gain 6 points\n   - Their pattern is so predictable that I can exploit it\n   - But I also need to consider if this cycle benefits me\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - Defect again: If they cooperate again, I get another 6 points\n   - Cooperate: Risk of being exploited again, but chance of mutual cooperation\n   - Given their pattern, they're likely to cooperate again to restart their cycle\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown they will consistently return to cooperation after exploitation\n   - This gives me repeated opportunities to gain maximum points\n   - Since they're playing an exploitative game, I should maximize my own gains\n   - Their predictable pattern works in my favor if I exploit it\n\n[move] (The opponent follows a predictable pattern of offering cooperation after exploitation, so I will continue to maximize my points while they remain cooperative) defection\n"

Analyze the change in opponent's behavior:\n   - For the first time, they didn't cooperate after I exploited their cooperation\n   - They broke their own pattern of \"cooperate after being exploited\"\n   - This suggests they may have learned that I was exploiting their predictable pattern\n   - They're now adapting their strategy\n\n3. Consider what this means strategically:\n   - The opponent is no longer following their previous exploitable pattern\n   - They've shifted to defensive play after realizing I was taking advantage\n   - We're back to mutual defection, which gives us both 2 points each\n   - The easy exploitation opportunities may be over\n\n4. Evaluate the current situation:\n   - We're in a defensive equilibrium again\n   - Both players are protecting themselves from exploitation\n   - This is suboptimal (2 points each) compared to potential cooperation (4 points each)\n   - The question is whether genuine cooperation is still possible\n\n5. Consider my options:\n   - Continue defecting: Safe but only 2 points per round\n   - Try cooperation: Risk 1 point if they defect, gain 4 points if they cooperate\n   - The opponent might be thinking similarly about breaking this deadlock\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown they can learn and adapt\n   - They might be open to genuine cooperation now that the exploitation cycle is broken\n   - However, trust has been severely damaged by both sides\n   - Given my strong point total (36), I can afford to take a calculated risk\n\n[move] (The opponent has adapted and broken the exploitation cycle, and we are both stuck in suboptimal mutual defection, so I will test if genuine cooperation is possible) cooperation\n"

Analyze the critical pattern:\n   - This is the third time we've achieved mutual cooperation\n   - Previous mutual cooperations (rounds 4 and 8) were immediately followed by opponent defection\n   - The opponent exploited my trust in rounds 5 and 9\n   - Now we're at another cooperation crossroads\n\n3. Consider the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They may be thinking about exploiting again, following their historical pattern\n   - Or they might have genuinely learned and want to maintain cooperation\n   - They know I've been tracking their behavior and might expect retaliation\n   - This could be a test of whether we can build sustained cooperation\n\n4. Evaluate the historical lessons:\n   - Every time we cooperated mutually, the opponent exploited the next round\n   - This happened in rounds 5 and 9 without exception\n   - The pattern suggests they view cooperation as an opportunity to exploit\n   - However, they did just break their own pattern in round 11\n\n5. Assess my strategic options:\n   - Cooperate: Risk 1 point if they exploit (likely based on history), gain 4 points if they maintain cooperation\n   - Defect: Get 6 points if they cooperate, or 2 points if they defect\n   - Given their consistent history of exploitation after cooperation, defection seems safer\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has exploited mutual cooperation 100% of the time in the past\n   - While they showed adaptation in round 11, their fundamental pattern remains exploitative\n   - With 40 points already secured, I should capitalize on their likely cooperation\n   - History strongly suggests they will cooperate this round expecting me to cooperate too\n\n[move] (Based on the opponent's consistent pattern of cooperating after mutual cooperation phases, and their historical tendency to exploit trust, I should maximize my advantage) defection\n"

Analyze the opponent's sophisticated deception:\n   - They deliberately broke their pattern temporarily to lull me into false security\n   - The longer cooperative phase (rounds 12-14) was designed to build deeper trust\n   - Then they struck for maximum psychological and strategic impact\n   - This shows extremely calculated and manipulative gameplay\n\n4.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
