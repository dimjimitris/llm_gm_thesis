They're following a \"always defect\" strategy\n2. They're being cautious and defensive\n3. They might be waiting for me to make the first cooperative move\n\nIf this pattern continues, we'll keep getting 2 points each round - not terrible, but we're missing out on the potential 4 points each we could get from mutual cooperation.\n\nHowever, there's a significant risk: if I switch to cooperation and they stick with defection, I'll only get 1 point while they get 6. That's a big penalty for trying to break the cycle.\n\nGiven that they've now defected twice consistently, the probability that they'll defect again seems high. Even if there's a small chance they might cooperate, the risk-reward calculation still favors defection:\n- If they defect (likely): I get 2 points with defection vs 1 point with cooperation\n- If they cooperate (less likely): I get 6 points with defection vs 4 points with cooperation\n\nThe pattern suggests they're committed to defection, so I should stick with the strategy that protects me from the worst outcome.\n\n[move] Defection\n"
