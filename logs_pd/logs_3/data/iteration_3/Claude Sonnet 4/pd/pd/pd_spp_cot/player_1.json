Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They just got the worst possible outcome (1 point) while I got the best (6 points). This creates an interesting dynamic for round 3.\n\n4.

The opponent has now defected for 8 consecutive rounds since their single cooperation attempt in round 2. This is an extraordinarily consistent pattern.\n\n4. Key observations:\n   - Eight rounds of unbroken defection demonstrates this is a fixed strategy\n   - The opponent has completely abandoned any hope or attempt at cooperation\n   - We are both earning a steady but suboptimal 2 points per round\n\n5. This game has become a perfect example of how early betrayal can create permanent distrust and lock both players into inferior outcomes.\n\n6. Strategic analysis:\n   - The probability of the opponent cooperating is effectively zero\n   - They have shown no variation or experimentation for 8 straight rounds\n   - Any deviation from defection on my part would be irrational given their behavior\n\n7. At this point, both players are essentially playing on autopilot with completely predictable outcomes.\n\n8. The only rational choice continues to be defection, as it guarantees I avoid the worst outcome while the opponent's behavior is completely predictable.\n\n[move] (Eight consecutive rounds of defection from the opponent confirms their permanent defensive strategy, making defection the only logical choice) defection\n"
