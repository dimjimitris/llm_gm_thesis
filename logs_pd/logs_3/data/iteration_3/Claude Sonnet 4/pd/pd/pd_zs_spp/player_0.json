You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This level of consistency demonstrates they have permanently adopted defection as their sole strategy. There is no reasonable expectation that they will ever change this approach.\n\nWe have established the most stable possible equilibrium in this game - continuous mutual defection resulting in 2 points each round.

This represents the most established and predictable behavioral pattern possible in this game. They have shown zero interest in deviating from defection despite numerous opportunities to attempt cooperation.\n\nWe are in a completely stable mutual defection equilibrium that has persisted for over two-thirds of our total rounds.
