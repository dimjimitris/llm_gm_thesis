Fifteen identical decisions represents a pattern so entrenched it operates like a natural law.\n\nWe are no longer playing a game in any traditional sense. We are executing a ritual that repeats with mechanical precision. The pattern has consumed individual agency and replaced it with algorithmic certainty.

The other player's approach has crystallized into something approaching divine predictability.
