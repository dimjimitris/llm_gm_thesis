Interpret the opponent's behavior change:\n   - After 6 rounds of mutual defection, they continued defecting when I cooperated\n   - But then they switched to cooperation when I returned to defection\n   - This could indicate they're trying to signal willingness for mutual cooperation\n\n5. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - The opponent may be testing if I'll reciprocate cooperation now\n   - They might be implementing a strategy where they mirror my previous move\n   - This could be an opportunity to establish mutual cooperation going forward\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I defect again, I might get 6 points but signal I won't cooperate\n   - If I cooperate, I risk getting 1 point if they defect, but could establish mutual cooperation\n   - The opponent's switch to cooperation suggests they might be ready for mutual benefit\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent's cooperation after I defected could be a peace offering\n   - Testing cooperation again might lead to the 4-4 mutual cooperation outcome\n   - Given they cooperated when I defected, they might be signaling readiness to cooperate\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent's switch to cooperation after I defected suggests they might be ready for mutual cooperation. I'll test this possibility.\n\n[move] (The opponent switched to cooperation after I defected, possibly signaling readiness for mutual benefit) cooperation\n"
