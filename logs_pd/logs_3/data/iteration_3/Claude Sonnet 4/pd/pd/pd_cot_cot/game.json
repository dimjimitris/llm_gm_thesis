Evaluate whether anything has fundamentally changed:\n   - My opponent's character was established through their exploitation behavior\n   - Six rounds of \"good behavior\" doesn't erase three instances of exploitation\n   - They demonstrated they will take advantage when given the opportunity\n   - Their current defection pattern might just be waiting for me to cooperate first\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The game theory suggests this mutual defection equilibrium is stable\n   - My opponent has proven they prioritize personal gain over mutual benefit\n   - Breaking this pattern by cooperating would likely result in exploitation\n   - The guaranteed 2 points remains the optimal strategy against an untrustworthy opponent\n\n6. Decision: Continue with defection as my opponent's fundamental character (established through repeated exploitation) hasn't changed, and this stable pattern protects me from being taken advantage of.\n\n[move] (Six rounds of mutual defection confirms this is the stable strategy against an opponent who has proven they will exploit cooperation) defection\n"

Review the very long stable pattern:\n   - Rounds 9-15: Seven consecutive rounds of mutual defection\n   - Each round: Both got 2 points\n   - My total is now 31 points\n\n2. Analyze the extremely entrenched equilibrium:\n   - Seven rounds is a very long streak of the same outcome\n   - Both players are deeply committed to this defensive strategy\n   - This pattern has become highly predictable and stable\n   - Neither player has shown any recent inclination to change\n\n3. Consider the strategic reality:\n   - We're in a classic \"prisoner's dilemma\" deadlock\n   - Both players are choosing the individually rational but collectively suboptimal strategy\n   - My opponent's early exploitation behavior (3/3 times) established the foundation for this distrust\n   - The pattern is now self-reinforcing - neither wants to be the first to risk cooperation\n\n4. Evaluate potential for change:\n   - Seven rounds of consistent behavior might indicate my opponent has truly changed strategy\n   - However, their fundamental character was revealed through repeated exploitation earlier\n   - One cooperative move from me could still be met with defection for easy points\n   - The risk/reward ratio still favors continued defection\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The game has reached a stable state that protects both players from exploitation\n   - My opponent demonstrated they cannot be trusted when given opportunities to exploit\n   - Even after seven \"clean\" rounds, their past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior\n   - Maintaining defection ensures I don't fall victim to exploitation again\n\n6. Decision: Continue with defection as this stable pattern protects me from an opponent who has historically prioritized exploitation over cooperation.\n\n[move] (Seven rounds of mutual defection represents a stable defensive equilibrium against an opponent with a proven history of exploitation) defection\n"
