Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Risk calculation for cooperation:\n   - Best case: Opponent also switches to cooperation, both get 4 points\n   - Worst case: Opponent continues defecting, I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - The potential gain is 4-2=2 extra points\n   - The potential loss is 2-1=1 point compared to continued defection\n\n5.

Analysis of what just happened:\n   - Round 9: Both players defected (2 points each)\n   - This breaks the recent pattern where opponent cooperated after I defected\n   - The opponent has shifted their strategy again\n\n2. Review of the complete pattern so far:\n   - Rounds 1-3: Mutual defection (2 points each)\n   - Round 4: I cooperated, opponent defected (1 vs 6)\n   - Rounds 5-6: I defected, opponent cooperated (6 vs 1 each)\n   - Round 7: I cooperated, opponent defected (1 vs 6)\n   - Round 8: I defected, opponent cooperated (6 vs 1)\n   - Round 9: Both defected (2 points each)\n\n3. Current score analysis:\n   - Previous total: 26 points for me, 21 points for opponent\n   - After round 9: 26 + 2 = 28 points for me, 21 + 2 = 23 points for opponent\n   - I maintain a 5-point advantage\n\n4. Strategic assessment of opponent's behavior change:\n   - They may have realized their cooperative responses were being exploited\n   - They've returned to defection, possibly to protect themselves\n   - This could signal a return to the mutual defection equilibrium from early rounds\n   - Or they might be testing a new strategy\n\n5. Decision considerations:\n   - If we're returning to mutual defection, both get 2 points per round\n   - If I cooperate and they continue defecting, I get exploited again (1 vs 6)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate, I get 6 points\n   - Given their unpredictable strategy changes, defection remains the safest choice\n   - The opponent has shown they will exploit cooperation when given the chance\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection for protection\n\n[move] (The opponent broke their pattern and returned to defection, confirming their unpredictable and exploitative nature - I'll stick with defection to maintain protection) defection\n"
