Analyze the strategic situation:\n   - This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma game\n   - If I assume the opponent will cooperate, defecting gives me 6 points vs 4 points for cooperating\n   - If I assume the opponent will defect, defecting gives me 2 points vs 1 point for cooperating\n   - Defection dominates cooperation in terms of maximizing my individual payoff\n\n3. Consider the opponent is \"fresh\" (new player):\n   - Fresh players often start with cooperative behavior\n   - They may not immediately recognize the dominant strategy\n   - This increases the likelihood they will cooperate\n\n4. Calculate expected outcomes:\n   - If opponent cooperates and I defect: I get 6 points (best outcome for me)\n   - If opponent defects and I defect: I get 2 points (better than getting 1)\n   - Defection protects me from the worst outcome while giving me the chance for the best outcome\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since defection maximizes my points regardless of what the opponent chooses, and the opponent being fresh suggests they may cooperate, I should defect.\n\n[move] Defection"

Consider a critical strategic reassessment:\n   - At eleven rounds, I need to question whether my analysis is becoming too rigid\n   - While the opponent has been perfectly consistent, perhaps I should consider that they might be thinking the same way about me\n   - Maybe they're waiting for ME to signal cooperation first\n   - Both of us might be trapped in the same logical loop of \"the other will defect\"\n\n4. Evaluate the potential for breaking the cycle:\n   - If both players are rational and stuck in this pattern, someone needs to take the risk\n   - Eleven rounds might actually be the perfect time to attempt cooperation - it's unexpected\n   - The opponent might be surprised by a cooperation move and reciprocate\n   - However, the risk remains: very likely to get only 1 point if they continue defecting\n\n5. Consider long-term vs immediate optimization:\n   - Continuing to defect guarantees 2 points but perpetuates suboptimal outcomes\n   - One round of cooperation risk (potentially losing 1 point) could unlock much better future outcomes\n   - After eleven rounds, even a small chance of breaking into mutual cooperation could be worth the risk\n   - But the evidence still heavily suggests this opponent will defect regardless\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: While eleven rounds creates compelling statistical evidence for continued defection, and the risk of cooperation remains high, the established pattern is so strong that attempting cooperation would almost certainly result in only 1 point.

Consider the critical juncture:\n   - Seven rounds is an extremely strong behavioral sample\n   - At some point, continuing the same analysis becomes circular\n   - If this opponent was ever going to cooperate, some signal might have appeared by now\n   - However, maybe they're thinking the same thing about me\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic options:\n   - Continue defecting: Almost guaranteed 2 points, maintaining safe but suboptimal status quo\n   - Attempt cooperation: Very high risk of getting 1 point, but could potentially break the cycle\n   - The mathematical expectation still heavily favors defection given the opponent's perfect defection record\n\n5. Consider breaking the deadlock:\n   - Seven rounds of identical play suggests both players are stuck in this pattern\n   - In game theory, sometimes one player needs to take a calculated risk to improve outcomes\n   - However, with such consistent defection, the opponent may be committed to this strategy regardless\n   - The cost of being wrong remains significant\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Seven rounds of perfect mutual defection shows an extremely committed opponent. While theoretically someone should attempt cooperation to break suboptimal equilibria, the evidence strongly suggests this opponent will defect regardless. I should continue defecting to secure the reliable 2 points.\n\n[move] Defection",

Analyze the strategic deadlock:\n   - We're in an extremely entrenched mutual defection cycle\n   - Both players have \"lost\" 16 potential points compared to mutual cooperation (2 extra points \u00d7 8 rounds)\n   - This is now beyond just a pattern - it's become a defining characteristic of this opponent\n   - The predictability is at absolute maximum\n\n3. Consider the mathematical reality:\n   - With 8 rounds of evidence, the probability of opponent defecting approaches near certainty\n   - Expected value of cooperation: ~1 point (opponent almost certainly defects)\n   - Expected value of defection: ~2 points (continuing established pattern)\n   - The risk/reward ratio has not fundamentally changed despite the long history\n\n4. Evaluate strategic thinking evolution:\n   - At this point, both players are clearly committed to defection\n   - Eight rounds suggests this isn't experimentation - it's a core strategy\n   - Either the opponent is purely rational and will never cooperate, or they're waiting for me to signal first\n   - But given their consistency, even my cooperation signal might not change their behavior\n\n5. Consider the possibility of permanent defection:\n   - Some players adopt \"always defect\" as their strategy regardless of opponent behavior\n   - Eight rounds of perfect consistency suggests this might be such a player\n   - Attempting cooperation could be seen as weakness to exploit rather than a cooperation signal\n   - The fundamental game theory math hasn't changed - defection remains dominant\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Eight rounds of unwavering mutual defection indicates an opponent who is extremely committed to defection.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
