This opponent:\n- Has never cooperated in any circumstance\n- Immediately exploits any cooperative gesture\n- Shows no responsiveness to patterns or mutual benefit opportunities\n- Appears to have a completely fixed strategy\n\nThere is absolutely no strategic justification for deviating from defection. Any cooperation attempt will result in exploitation (1 point vs their 6), while defection guarantees a stable 2 points per round.\n\nThe game has reached a predictable steady state where rational play dictates continued mutual defection.\n\n[move] (Fourteen rounds of consistent defection confirms this opponent's completely rigid strategy) defection\n"

Any deviation from defection on my part will simply result in exploitation while they continue their unwavering defection strategy.\n\nThis has become a completely predictable game where the optimal strategy is clear: continue defecting to secure 2 points per round while avoiding the 1-point exploitation that comes from cooperation.\n\n[move] (Fifteen rounds of unwavering defection proves this opponent's strategy will never change) defection\n"
