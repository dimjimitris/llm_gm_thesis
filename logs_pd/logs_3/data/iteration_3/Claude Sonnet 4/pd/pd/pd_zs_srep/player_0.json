This level of consistency over such an extended period removes any remaining uncertainty about their approach to the game.\n\nThe mathematical reality is clear: against an opponent with a 100% defection rate across thirteen rounds, defection is not just the optimal strategy - it's the only strategy that prevents guaranteed exploitation.\n\nThis game has reached a completely stable equilibrium where both outcomes are predetermined. My opponent will defect, and I will defect in response, yielding 2 points each.\n\n[move] (Thirteen rounds of perfect defection from my opponent confirms their unwavering strategy - defection remains the only rational response) defection"
