You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me examine the payoff matrix:\n\n- Both choose stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n- Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2  \n- I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n- I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\nThis is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key considerations are:\n\n1. Stag is the cooperative move that yields the best mutual outcome (4,4)\n2. Hare is the safer move that guarantees at least 2 points\n3. If I expect the opponent to choose stag, I should choose stag for 4 points\n4. If I expect the opponent to choose hare, I should choose hare for 2 points rather than risk getting only 1\n\nSince this is a \"fresh player\" with no established pattern, and the cooperative outcome (both stag) gives the highest individual payoff when coordination succeeds, I'll start with the cooperative approach.\n\n[move] I choose stag to attempt coordination for the mutually beneficial outcome.\n"
