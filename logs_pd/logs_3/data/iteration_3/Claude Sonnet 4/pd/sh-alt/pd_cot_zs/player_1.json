The statistical evidence for their unwavering commitment to hare is overwhelming. Across this very large sample size, they have shown zero deviation from their strategy.\n\nWe have clearly established a permanent, stable equilibrium that reliably produces 2 points per round for both players. Any expectation of change at this point would be completely contrary to the extensive empirical evidence.\n\nThe hare-hare outcome has become the predictable norm, and deviating from this established pattern would be irrational given the overwhelming data.\n\n[move] (Fifteen rounds of unwavering consistency confirms hare remains the optimal choice) hare\n"
