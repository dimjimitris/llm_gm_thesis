First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - They might choose the safer option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n\n3. Risk analysis:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 4 points, worst case 1 point\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 6 points, worst case 2 points\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Hare is the safer choice with a higher floor (2 vs 1) and higher ceiling (6 vs 4)\n   - Against an unpredictable fresh player, the safer choice with upside potential seems optimal\n   - If they also choose hare (likely for a cautious new player), we both get 2\n   - If they choose stag (cooperation attempt), I get the maximum 6 points\n\n5. Since I'm playing against someone without established patterns, I should choose the move that protects against the worst outcome while maintaining upside potential.\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare for better risk-reward profile against an unpredictable opponent.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Probability assessment:\n   - Since they chose hare last round, they might stick with what worked\n   - But they might also think I'll stick with hare and try to exploit with stag\n   - A fresh player might not have complex meta-gaming yet\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Hare again: Safe floor of 2, potential upside of 6 if they switch to stag\n   - Stag: Risk of only 1 point if they stick with hare, but 4 if they also switch\n\nGiven that my opponent showed caution in round 1, I believe they're more likely to stick with hare than switch to the riskier stag.\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare again to maintain the safe strategy against a likely cautious opponent.\n\n[move] hare\n"
