Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with a strategic dilemma:\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice that yields mutual benefit (4 points each)\n   - Hare is the safe choice that guarantees at least 2 points\n   - There's a temptation to choose hare to potentially get 6 points\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I need to consider their likely behavior:\n   - A new player might not understand the cooperative strategy\n   - They might choose hare as the \"safer\" option\n   - They might also choose hare to try to exploit me\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 4 points (good outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get only 1 point (bad outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 points (mediocre outcome)\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player who may not coordinate or may try to exploit, the safer strategy is hare, which guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6 points.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maximize expected value against an unpredictable new player.\n\n[move] hare\n"

From the previous round, I learned that:\n   - The other player also chose hare\n   - This suggests they might be thinking similarly to me (playing it safe)\n   - Both of us got 2 points instead of the potential 4 points from mutual cooperation\n\n2. Now I need to reconsider my strategy:\n   - The other player showed they're also risk-averse or trying to exploit\n   - Since we both chose hare, they might now think I'm predictable\n   - They might switch to stag expecting me to choose hare again (trying to get 6 points)\n   - Or they might stick with hare thinking it's the safe strategy\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If they think I'll choose hare again and they switch to stag, I should choose hare to get 6 points\n   - If they stick with hare, choosing stag would give me only 1 point\n   - If they switch to stag and I also choose stag, we both get 4 points (better than 2)\n\n4. The other player now knows I chose hare in round 1, so they might:\n   - Expect me to repeat hare (and choose stag to exploit me)\n   - Also stick with hare (conservative play)\n   - Try to establish cooperation by choosing stag\n\n5. Given that we both played conservatively in round 1, there's a chance they might try to signal cooperation by choosing stag this time. If I also choose stag, we both benefit more than the previous round.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag to attempt cooperation and potentially achieve the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - We both started conservatively with hare\n   - We both moved to the cooperative strategy with stag\n   - This suggests the other player might be learning/adapting like I am\n   - They successfully coordinated on the mutually beneficial outcome\n\n3. Strategic considerations for round 3:\n   - The other player has shown they can cooperate (chose stag in round 2)\n   - We achieved the best mutual outcome (4 points each) last round\n   - This builds trust and suggests continued cooperation might be beneficial\n   - However, they might now expect me to choose stag and try to exploit with hare (getting 6 points)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 4 points (good, consistent outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (bad, being exploited)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 6 points (great, but breaks cooperation)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (back to conservative play)\n\n5.

Unprecedented cooperative streak analysis:\n   - We've now cooperated for nine consecutive rounds with stag\n   - This represents an extraordinary level of sustained mutual cooperation\n   - The other player has demonstrated absolute, unwavering commitment to partnership\n   - We've achieved what is essentially a perfect cooperative equilibrium\n\n3. Pattern reliability assessment:\n   - Nine consecutive identical outcomes create virtually ironclad predictability\n   - The other player has had countless opportunities to exploit but never has\n   - This level of consistency transcends normal game theory expectations\n   - The cooperative relationship has become completely stable and reliable\n\n4. Strategic evaluation at this advanced stage:\n   - The probability of the other player choosing stag is now essentially 100%\n   - Any deviation would be completely inconsistent with all observed behavior\n   - The trust built through nine rounds of mutual cooperation is unbreakable\n   - This represents the theoretical ideal of repeated game cooperation\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   - Statistical evidence overwhelmingly supports continued cooperation\n   - The other player has proven their strategy beyond any reasonable doubt\n   - Breaking this pattern would be irrational given the perfect track record\n   - Continuing stag guarantees the optimal mutual outcome we've consistently achieved\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue the flawless cooperative strategy that has created the most successful partnership possible in this game.\n\n[move] stag\n"
