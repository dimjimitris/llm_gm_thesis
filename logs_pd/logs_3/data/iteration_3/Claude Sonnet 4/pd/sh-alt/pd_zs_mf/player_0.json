Thirteen consecutive identical moves with zero variation. My opponent has essentially become a predictable algorithm - they will choose hare regardless of any other factors.\n\nAt this point, I'm dealing with what appears to be a completely fixed strategy player. They've shown no responsiveness to:\n- Different outcomes\n- My strategic variations \n- The passage of time\n- Potential for higher mutual payoffs\n\nWe've settled into a stable pattern where we both reliably earn 2 points per round. While this isn't the optimal 4 points we could both earn with mutual stag cooperation, it's become the established equilibrium of our game.\n\nGiven thirteen consecutive hare choices, predicting their fourteenth move requires no complex analysis - they will almost certainly choose hare again. The mathematical expectation strongly favors continuing to match their strategy.\n\n[move] (Thirteen consecutive hare moves from my opponent establishes their complete predictability - I'll choose hare for another reliable 2 points) hare\n"

My opponent has essentially become a deterministic system - their choice is as predictable as a mathematical constant.\n\nWe've now played enough rounds to establish that this isn't just a temporary strategy or cautious early-game behavior. This appears to be their permanent approach to the game. They've found a strategy that guarantees them at least 2 points per round and occasionally rewards them with 6 points when opponents try to cooperate with stag.\n\nFrom their perspective, the hare strategy is actually quite rational - it provides consistent returns with no downside risk below 2 points.\n\nWith fifteen consecutive identical choices, the statistical evidence for their next move is overwhelming. The probability of them choosing hare again approaches virtual certainty.\n\nThe stable equilibrium we've established (mutual hare for 2 points each) seems likely to continue indefinitely given their unwavering behavioral pattern.\n\n[move] (Fifteen consecutive hare choices establishes complete predictability - I'll choose hare for the expected 2 points) hare\n"
