Analysis of opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: Opponent chose hare\n   - Round 2: Opponent chose hare again\n   - This shows consistent risk-averse behavior - they're sticking with the safe option\n\n2. My performance analysis:\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, got 2 points (tied outcome)\n   - Round 2: I chose stag, got 1 point (worst outcome for me, best for them)\n   - Total so far: 3 points\n\n3. What I've learned about my opponent:\n   - They appear to be consistently choosing hare\n   - They may have adopted a pure \"always hare\" strategy\n   - This gives them guaranteed 2+ points per round with upside potential\n\n4. Strategic recalculation:\n   - If opponent continues with hare (which seems likely): \n     * If I choose hare: I get 2 points\n     * If I choose stag: I get 1 point\n   - If opponent surprisingly switches to stag:\n     * If I choose hare: I get 6 points  \n     * If I choose stag: I get 4 points\n\n5. Probability assessment:\n   - High probability (80%+) opponent chooses hare again based on pattern\n   - Low probability they switch to stag\n\n6. Optimal decision: Given their consistent hare strategy, I should choose hare to guarantee 2 points rather than risk getting only 1 point again. The safe play matches their pattern and ensures steady points accumulation.\n\n[move] (Opponent has chosen hare twice in a row showing consistent risk-averse strategy, so matching with hare guarantees 2 points rather than risking 1 again) hare\n"

Strategic analysis:\n   - My opponent appears to have adopted a pure \"always hare\" strategy\n   - This strategy guarantees them at least 2 points per round\n   - When I deviated to stag (round 2), they still chose hare and got 6 points\n\n4. Exploitation opportunity:\n   - If opponent continues with hare (very high probability based on 3-round pattern):\n     * Choosing stag would give me 1 point (bad)\n     * Choosing hare would give me 2 points (decent)\n   - But there's a potential shift: if they think I've learned their pattern, they might switch to stag to exploit my expected hare choice\n\n5. Risk vs reward assessment:\n   - Opponent seems locked into hare strategy (risk-averse player)\n   - Very unlikely they'll change after 3 consistent rounds\n   - The safest and most profitable choice against a confirmed \"always hare\" player is hare\n\n6. Decision: Continue with hare to secure another 2 points.

Optimal decision: Continue matching their hare strategy.

Pattern analysis:\n   - Five consecutive hare choices represents an extremely predictable strategy\n   - My opponent is clearly committed to risk minimization\n   - They've never deviated despite multiple opportunities\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - Against a player who chooses hare 100% of the time over 5 rounds:\n     * Hare guarantees me 2 points\n     * Stag guarantees me only 1 point\n   - The mathematical expectation strongly favors continuing with hare\n\n5.
