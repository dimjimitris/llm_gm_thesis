Analyze the opponent's strategic shift:\n   - After three consistent hare choices, they switched to stag\n   - This could indicate they were trying to establish a pattern to lure me into switching\n   - Or they got frustrated with the 2-2 stalemate and tried to break it\n   - They may have expected me to switch to stag for the mutual 4-4 benefit\n\n3.

Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - Total points: 6 + 6 = 12 points from previous rounds, plus 6 from this round = 18 points\n   - I'm in a strong position and ahead significantly\n   - The opponent is likely frustrated and may return to defensive play\n\n5.

Evaluate the strategic crossroads:\n   - My 9-point lead continues to grow steadily\n   - At some point, such extreme predictability should theoretically be exploitable\n   - However, being wrong even once would be catastrophic to my lead\n\n5. Consider the meta-strategic question:\n   - Is there ever a point where a pattern becomes so reliable that it's worth exploiting?\n   - The opponent's behavior suggests they've essentially given up on winning and settled for damage control\n   - Six straight defensive moves after being burned suggests deep psychological commitment to safety\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Even with 90% historical consistency and 6 straight hare choices, the risk remains too high\n   - My commanding lead means I don't need to take risks - steady progress wins\n   - The opponent's pattern is so extreme that if they ever switch, I'll be perfectly positioned to capitalize\n   - Conservative play preserves my advantage while keeping upside potential intact\n\n[move] (Pattern reaches near-certainty but my commanding lead makes risk-taking unnecessary) hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's surprising pattern break:\n   - After 9 consecutive hare choices, they suddenly switched to stag\n   - This could indicate they finally got frustrated with the defensive stalemate\n   - Or they may have been setting an extremely long trap, expecting me to eventually switch\n   - They just received their second-ever 1-point punishment\n\n3. Consider what the opponent might be thinking now:\n   - They just got burned again with the worst possible outcome (1 point vs my 6)\n   - This is their second catastrophic failure when trying stag (rounds 4 and 14)\n   - They're now even further behind (42 vs 28 = 14-point deficit)\n   - This massive failure might push them back to defensive hare play\n\n4. Evaluate the psychological impact:\n   - Getting punished twice for the same strategic choice creates strong negative reinforcement\n   - The opponent might return to their ultra-conservative hare pattern\n   - Or they might double down on stag, thinking I'll now switch to capitalize on mutual cooperation\n\n5. Consider my strategic position:\n   - My lead has expanded dramatically to 14 points\n   - I've now capitalized perfectly on both of their stag attempts\n   - The opponent is likely demoralized and even more risk-averse\n\n6. Strategic decision for next round:\n   - The opponent just got severely punished for breaking their pattern\n   - History suggests they'll return to defensive hare play after such failures\n   - Hare continues to be optimal - it protects against their potential stag while capitalizing when they choose it\n\n[move] (Opponent just got burned again trying stag, likely to return to ultra-defensive hare play) hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's behavioral pattern:\n   - Round 4: Tried stag, got 1 point (I got 6)\n   - Rounds 5-13: Chose hare for 9 consecutive rounds\n   - Round 14: Tried stag again, got 1 point (I got 6) \n   - Round 15: Immediately back to hare\n   - This shows a clear pattern: experiment with stag \u2192 get punished \u2192 return to defensive hare\n\n3. Consider the psychological reinforcement:\n   - The opponent has now been severely punished twice for choosing stag\n   - Both times they got the worst outcome (1 point) while I got the best (6 points)\n   - This double negative reinforcement should make them even more committed to hare\n   - My lead has grown to 14 points, making their situation more desperate\n\n4. Evaluate the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They're significantly behind and their two attempts to break the pattern failed catastrophically\n   - The immediate return to hare after round 14 shows they learned the lesson again\n   - They may settle back into another long defensive streak\n   - The mounting point deficit might make them more conservative, not less\n\n5. Consider strategic implications:\n   - The opponent has now demonstrated they will occasionally try stag but get punished\n   - My hare strategy perfectly capitalizes on their stag attempts while staying safe\n   - The pattern suggests they'll likely stick with hare for multiple rounds before trying again\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent's immediate return to hare confirms their defensive mindset\n   - They're likely to play conservatively for several rounds after this second failure\n   - Hare remains optimal: safe against their hare, profitable against their occasional stag\n\n[move] (Opponent predictably returned to defensive hare after second stag failure, likely to stay defensive) hare\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
