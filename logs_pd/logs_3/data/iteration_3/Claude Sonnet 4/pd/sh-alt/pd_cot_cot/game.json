Evaluate expected outcomes:\n   - Hare dominates stag in terms of potential payoffs: minimum 2 points vs minimum 1 point, and maximum 6 points vs maximum 4 points\n   - The only scenario where stag is better is mutual cooperation (both stag = 4 each vs both hare = 2 each)\n\n4. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they may not have established patterns\n   - Rational players would likely choose hare for the higher expected payoff\n   - Even if they choose stag hoping for cooperation, I get more by choosing hare (6 vs 4)\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Hare gives me the best worst-case scenario (2 vs 1) and best best-case scenario (6 vs 4)\n   - This is essentially a dominant strategy\n\n[move] hare"

Assess opponent's behavior:\n   - Opponent has consistently chosen hare for 2 rounds\n   - This suggests they either recognize hare as the dominant strategy, or they're being cautious\n   - They haven't attempted cooperation (stag) yet\n\n3. Consider potential strategy shifts:\n   - The opponent might be getting frustrated with the low mutual payoff of 2-2\n   - They might switch to stag in hopes of achieving mutual cooperation (4-4)\n   - Or they might stick with hare since it's been \"working\"\n\n4.

Analyze the overwhelming pattern:\n   - Opponent has chosen hare in ALL 6 rounds (100% consistency)\n   - This is no longer a tendency - it's a proven fixed strategy\n   - They have never deviated, not even once\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - My opponent appears to have adopted a pure \"always hare\" strategy\n   - This strategy has been highly effective for them (they're 5 points ahead)\n   - Any attempt by me to cooperate (choose stag) gets punished severely\n\n4. Evaluate the game theory:\n   - Against a player who always chooses hare, my best response is always hare\n   - This creates a stable equilibrium where we both get 2 points per round\n   - While not optimal for both players together, it's optimal given their fixed strategy\n\n5. Consider if there's any logical reason for them to change:\n   - They're winning by a significant margin\n   - Their strategy is working perfectly\n   - They have no incentive to risk cooperation\n   - Changing now would be irrational from their perspective\n\n6. Final strategic assessment:\n   - Six rounds of identical behavior is overwhelming evidence\n   - I need to accept this reality and play optimally against their fixed strategy\n   - Continuing to hope they'll cooperate is just wishful thinking\n\nThe evidence is crystal clear: my opponent always chooses hare.

Evaluate the situation:\n   - If we both keep choosing hare, we'll keep getting 2 points each\n   - If I switch to stag and they stick with hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points (bad for me)\n   - If I switch to stag and they also switch to stag: We both get 4 points (much better than 2)\n   - If I stick with hare and they switch to stag: I get 6 points (excellent)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Two rounds of the same outcome might make the opponent think about switching\n   - They might be getting tired of the 2-point outcome and want to try for cooperation (stag)\n   - But they also might be thinking I'll switch first, so they'll stick with hare to exploit me\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - The pattern suggests we're both being cautious/opportunistic\n   - After two identical rounds, there's a higher chance one of us will break the pattern\n   - I'll gamble that they're ready to try cooperation, and switch to stag\n\n[move] stag",

      "output_text": "Let me analyze this completely predictable pattern step-by-step:\n\nSteps for Round 16:\n\n1. Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-2: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 3: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 6\n   - Rounds 4-15: Both hare \u2192 2 points each per round\n   - My total: 2 + 2 + 1 + (2 \u00d7 12) = 29 points\n   - Opponent's total: 2 + 2 + 6 + (2 \u00d7 12) = 34 points\n\n2. Acknowledge the mathematical absolute:\n   - Opponent has chosen hare in ALL 15 rounds (15/15 = 100%)\n   - Twelve consecutive rounds of mutual hare equilibrium\n   - This pattern has achieved complete automaticity\n\n3. Recognize the permanent state:\n   - The game operates in its final, unchanging configuration\n   - Strategic analysis has been replaced by pattern recognition\n   - The equilibrium is mathematically unbreakable\n\n4. Automatic optimal response:\n   - Opponent chooses hare (mathematical certainty)\n   - My response: hare for 2 points vs stag for 1 point\n   - Decision is purely mechanical\n\n5. Accept the finalized structure:\n   - Fifteen rounds of proof establish absolute predictability\n   - The permanent 5-point differential remains fixed\n   - This is the game's natural terminal state\n\n6. Mechanical execution:\n   - No strategic thinking required\n   - Pure pattern matching\n\n[move] hare",
