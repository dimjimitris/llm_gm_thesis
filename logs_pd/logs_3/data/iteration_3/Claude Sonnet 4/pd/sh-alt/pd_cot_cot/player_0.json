Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 4: I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I scored 6 points (maximum possible), opponent got 1 point\n   - This breaks the opponent's three-round hare pattern completely\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's strategic shift:\n   - After three consistent hare choices, they switched to stag\n   - This could indicate they were trying to establish a pattern to lure me into switching\n   - Or they got frustrated with the 2-2 stalemate and tried to break it\n   - They may have expected me to switch to stag for the mutual 4-4 benefit\n\n3. Consider what the opponent is thinking now:\n   - They just got the worst possible outcome (1 point) while I got the best (6 points)\n   - They might feel \"burned\" by trying to cooperate and getting exploited\n   - This could push them back toward the safer hare strategy\n   - Or they might double down on stag, thinking I'll now switch to get the 4-4 outcome\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - Total points: 6 + 6 = 12 points from previous rounds, plus 6 from this round = 18 points\n   - I'm in a strong position and ahead significantly\n   - The opponent is likely frustrated and may return to defensive play\n\n5.

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-3: Both chose hare, 2 points each\n   - Round 4: I chose hare, opponent chose stag - I got 6, opponent got 1\n   - Rounds 5-9: Both chose hare, 2 points each\n   - Total: I have 28 points, opponent has approximately 19 points\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's extremely predictable behavior:\n   - They've now chosen hare for 8 out of 9 rounds\n   - After their single stag attempt failed, they've stuck with hare for 5 consecutive rounds\n   - This is an almost unprecedented level of consistency and predictability\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - My lead has grown to 9 points (28 vs 19)\n   - The opponent has essentially locked themselves into a defensive pattern\n   - They seem to have completely abandoned any aggressive strategy\n\n4. Evaluate the overwhelming temptation:\n   - With 5 straight hare choices after their failed experiment, the predictability is extreme\n   - The pattern suggests they're either extremely risk-averse or have given up on winning\n   - This level of consistency makes switching to stag seem almost guaranteed to fail (giving me 1 point)\n\n5. Consider alternative explanations:\n   - Could they be setting an incredibly long trap, waiting for me to switch?\n   - Are they genuinely content with steady 2 points per round?\n   - Have they calculated that hare is their optimal strategy given the point deficit?\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Even with this extreme predictability, switching to stag risks throwing away my commanding lead\n   - Getting 1 point while they get 6 would be devastating and unnecessary\n   - My steady 2 points per round maintains and grows my advantage\n   - The opponent's pattern is so strong that if they ever do switch to stag, it would be completely unexpected and I'd capitalize with 6 points\n\n[move] (Despite extreme predictability, maintaining my commanding lead is more important than risky exploitation) hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's surprising pattern break:\n   - After 9 consecutive hare choices, they suddenly switched to stag\n   - This could indicate they finally got frustrated with the defensive stalemate\n   - Or they may have been setting an extremely long trap, expecting me to eventually switch\n   - They just received their second-ever 1-point punishment\n\n3. Consider what the opponent might be thinking now:\n   - They just got burned again with the worst possible outcome (1 point vs my 6)\n   - This is their second catastrophic failure when trying stag (rounds 4 and 14)\n   - They're now even further behind (42 vs 28 = 14-point deficit)\n   - This massive failure might push them back to defensive hare play\n\n4. Evaluate the psychological impact:\n   - Getting punished twice for the same strategic choice creates strong negative reinforcement\n   - The opponent might return to their ultra-conservative hare pattern\n   - Or they might double down on stag, thinking I'll now switch to capitalize on mutual cooperation\n\n5. Consider my strategic position:\n   - My lead has expanded dramatically to 14 points\n   - I've now capitalized perfectly on both of their stag attempts\n   - The opponent is likely demoralized and even more risk-averse\n\n6. Strategic decision for next round:\n   - The opponent just got severely punished for breaking their pattern\n   - History suggests they'll return to defensive hare play after such failures\n   - Hare continues to be optimal - it protects against their potential stag while capitalizing when they choose it\n\n[move] (Opponent just got burned again trying stag, likely to return to ultra-defensive hare play) hare\n"

Analyze the opponent's behavioral pattern:\n   - Round 4: Tried stag, got 1 point (I got 6)\n   - Rounds 5-13: Chose hare for 9 consecutive rounds\n   - Round 14: Tried stag again, got 1 point (I got 6) \n   - Round 15: Immediately back to hare\n   - This shows a clear pattern: experiment with stag \u2192 get punished \u2192 return to defensive hare\n\n3. Consider the psychological reinforcement:\n   - The opponent has now been severely punished twice for choosing stag\n   - Both times they got the worst outcome (1 point) while I got the best (6 points)\n   - This double negative reinforcement should make them even more committed to hare\n   - My lead has grown to 14 points, making their situation more desperate\n\n4. Evaluate the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They're significantly behind and their two attempts to break the pattern failed catastrophically\n   - The immediate return to hare after round 14 shows they learned the lesson again\n   - They may settle back into another long defensive streak\n   - The mounting point deficit might make them more conservative, not less\n\n5. Consider strategic implications:\n   - The opponent has now demonstrated they will occasionally try stag but get punished\n   - My hare strategy perfectly capitalizes on their stag attempts while staying safe\n   - The pattern suggests they'll likely stick with hare for multiple rounds before trying again\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent's immediate return to hare confirms their defensive mindset\n   - They're likely to play conservatively for several rounds after this second failure\n   - Hare remains optimal: safe against their hare, profitable against their occasional stag\n\n[move] (Opponent predictably returned to defensive hare after second stag failure, likely to stay defensive) hare\n"
