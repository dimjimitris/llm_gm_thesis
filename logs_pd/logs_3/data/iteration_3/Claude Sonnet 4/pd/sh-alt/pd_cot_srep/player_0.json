Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with coordination and risk elements\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives good payoff for both (4 points each)\n   - But if I choose stag and opponent chooses hare, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses stag, I get the best individual outcome (6 points)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not understand the coordination aspect\n   - They might be tempted by the high payoff (6 points) from choosing hare when I choose stag\n   - Or they might play it safe with hare (guaranteed at least 2 points)\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Choosing stag is risky but could lead to mutual benefit if opponent cooperates\n   - Choosing hare is safer and gives me a chance at the highest payoff (6 points) if opponent chooses stag\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player who may not understand optimal coordination, and I want to maximize my points while minimizing risk, hare seems like the better choice.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also chose hare, suggesting they might be risk-averse\n   - They could be thinking similarly to me - avoiding the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - They might continue with the same safe strategy\n\n3. Consider my strategic options for this round:\n   - If I stick with hare and they stick with hare: We both get 2 points again\n   - If I switch to stag and they stick with hare: I get 1 point (bad for me)\n   - If I switch to stag and they also switch to stag: We both get 4 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I stick with hare and they switch to stag: I get 6 points (best for me)\n\n4. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - The opponent showed they're willing to play safe (chose hare last round)\n   - If they continue this pattern, choosing hare again gives me either 2 points (if they choose hare) or 6 points (if they switch to stag)\n   - Choosing stag is riskier but could lead to the mutually beneficial 4-4 outcome\n\n5.

Analyze what this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They've now chosen hare three times in a row\n   - They either have a very consistent risk-averse strategy, OR\n   - They might be deliberately exploiting the pattern by sticking with hare while expecting me to potentially switch to stag\n   - They just got their best possible reward (6 points)\n\n3.
