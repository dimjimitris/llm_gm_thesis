Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Final decision:\n   - Given the strong pattern of hare choices from my opponent, I should assume they'll likely choose hare again\n   - This means hare gives me 2 points, while stag would give me only 1 point\n   - I'll stick with hare for now\n\n[move] (The opponent has chosen hare twice in a row, so I expect them to continue this pattern, making hare the safer choice for me) hare\n"

Analyze what this pattern means:\n   - My opponent has chosen hare five consecutive times without any deviation\n   - This suggests they are either completely committed to the safe strategy or think I'm completely predictable\n   - We are both definitely trapped in a stable but clearly suboptimal equilibrium\n\n3. Calculate the opportunity cost:\n   - Over 5 rounds, we've each earned 10 points\n   - If we had cooperated with stag each round, we'd each have 20 points\n   - We've each \"lost\" 10 potential points due to this conservative approach\n\n4.

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-5: Both chose hare, both got 2 points each round\n   - Round 6: I chose stag, opponent chose hare - I got 1 point, opponent got 6 points\n   - Rounds 7-8: Both chose hare, both got 2 points each round\n   - Current totals: Me 15 points, opponent 20 points (opponent ahead by 5 points)\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's unwavering pattern:\n   - They have now chosen hare 8 out of 8 times (100% consistency)\n   - They have never shown any inclination toward cooperation or pattern-breaking\n   - When I attempted cooperation, they exploited it without reciprocating\n   - This is an extremely rigid and predictable strategy\n\n3. Assess my strategic position:\n   - I'm currently 5 points behind due to my failed cooperation attempt in round 6\n   - We're locked in a 2-point per round mutual hare pattern\n   - At this rate, I will never close the gap - we'll both just keep earning 2 points per round\n   - My opponent seems content with this outcome since they're ahead\n\n4. Consider alternative strategies:\n   - Continue hare: Maintains current 2-point outcome but never closes the gap\n   - Switch to stag: Almost certainly results in 1-point outcome based on opponent's perfect hare record\n   - The mathematical expectation strongly favors hare given opponent behavior\n\n5. Evaluate long-term implications:\n   - If this game continues indefinitely with mutual hare choices, I remain 5 points behind forever\n   - My opponent has no incentive to change since they benefit from the current situation\n   - Any deviation from hare on my part has historically been punished\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - My opponent has established the most predictable pattern possible (8/8 hare choices)\n   - They have proven they will exploit cooperation attempts\n   - While staying behind by 5 points is frustrating, falling further behind by choosing stag is worse\n   - The rational choice is to maintain the stable outcome\n\n[move] (My opponent has now chosen hare 8 consecutive times with perfect consistency and previously exploited my cooperation attempt, so I will continue with hare to maintain the stable 2-point outcome) hare\n"
