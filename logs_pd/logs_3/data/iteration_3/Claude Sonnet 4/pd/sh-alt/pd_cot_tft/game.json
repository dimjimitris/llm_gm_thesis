First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where cooperation (stag) gives mutual benefit, but defection (hare) can give higher individual rewards if the opponent cooperates.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I need to consider what they might do:\n   - They might not understand the strategic implications yet\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - They might go for the \"safe\" option (hare, guaranteeing at least 2 points)\n   - Or they might try to cooperate (stag) for mutual benefit\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 2 points (if they defect)\n\n5. Expected value consideration: Choosing hare guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point) and gives me a chance at the best individual outcome (6 points).\n\n6. Since this is against a fresh player who might not understand the cooperation dynamic yet, and I want to maximize my points, the safer strategic choice is hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose the \"safe\" option like I did\n   - They might be thinking similarly about minimizing risk\n   - They could be testing the waters in the first round\n   - They might continue with hare as a consistent strategy\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If they stick with hare again, I have two options:\n     * Choose hare: we both get 2 points again\n     * Choose stag: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - If they switch to stag this round:\n     * Choose hare: I get 6 points, they get 1 point  \n     * Choose stag: we both get 4 points\n\n4. Probability assessment:\n   - Since they chose hare in round 1, they might stick with what worked\n   - But they might also think I'll stick with hare and try to exploit that with stag\n   - There's also a chance they want to try cooperation (stag) this round\n\n5. Risk vs reward analysis:\n   - Hare guarantees at least 2 points but caps me at 6\n   - Stag could give me 4 (cooperation) or 1 (if they exploit)\n   - Given that they already showed risk-averse behavior, hare seems likely from them again\n\n6.

Risk assessment for switching to stag:\n   - Best case: They also switch to stag, we both get 4 points (better than 2)\n   - Worst case: They stick with hare, I get 1 point (worse than 2)\n   - The question is: are they likely to break their pattern?\n\n5.

Pattern confirmation:\n   - My experiment in round 10 didn't change their behavior at all\n   - They went right back to hare in round 11\n   - This proves they are completely inflexible and non-adaptive\n   - They will choose hare regardless of what I do\n\n3. Strategic clarity achieved:\n   - I now have complete certainty about their behavior\n   - The experiment cost me 1 point but provided valuable confirmation\n   - Any deviation from hare on my part will only hurt my score\n   - They are not a strategic thinker seeking mutual optimization\n\n4. Optimal strategy going forward:\n   - Choose hare every round to guarantee 2 points\n   - Never deviate again since they won't respond to cooperation signals\n   - Accept the stable (2,2) equilibrium as the best achievable outcome\n   - Focus on consistent point accumulation rather than risky experiments\n\n5. Lessons learned from the experiment:\n   - Some opponents are purely predictable and non-adaptive\n   - Testing cooperation can be valuable but shouldn't be repeated once proven futile\n   - The optimal response to a rigid hare player is always hare\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Return to the mathematically optimal strategy\n   - Maintain consistent 2-point scoring\n   - No more experiments needed\n\n[move] hare\n"

Current situation analysis:\n   - Round 12: Both chose hare, both got 2 points (pattern restored)\n   - Total so far: 23 points for me, 28 points for opponent\n   - My opponent is now 5 points ahead due to my round 10 experiment\n   - The stable (2,2) pattern has been re-established\n\n2. Strategic position assessment:\n   - I'm behind by 5 points because of my stag experiment\n   - However, continuing with hare ensures I don't fall further behind\n   - Each round we both choose hare, the gap remains constant at 5 points\n   - There's no way to catch up while they maintain their rigid hare strategy\n\n3. Mathematical reality:\n   - If they always choose hare, my best response is always hare (2 > 1)\n   - I cannot close the 5-point gap without them changing their strategy\n   - Since they've proven completely inflexible, the gap is permanent\n   - The goal now is to maximize total points, not to catch up\n\n4. Acceptance of strategic reality:\n   - My opponent has found an unbeatable strategy against experimentation\n   - By being completely predictable and rigid, they punish any deviation\n   - The only rational response is to match their strategy\n   - This creates a stable equilibrium where neither player can improve unilaterally\n\n5. Long-term strategy:\n   - Continue choosing hare to guarantee 2 points per round\n   - Accept that the 5-point deficit is permanent\n   - Focus on maximizing total accumulated points\n   - Maintain optimal play regardless of the current score difference\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Stick with the proven optimal strategy\n   - No more deviations or experiments\n   - Consistent hare choice maximizes my expected value\n\n[move] hare\n"
