The pattern is absolutely unwavering:\n\nRound 1: Both hare (2 each)\nRound 2: My hare vs their stag (I got 6, they got 1)\nRounds 3-14: Both hare (2 each for all)\n\nThis is now an extremely stable pattern. My opponent has had 12 consecutive opportunities to deviate from hare and hasn't taken a single one. They've clearly adopted hare as their permanent strategy after learning from their costly mistake in round 2.\n\nWe've essentially reached a Nash equilibrium where both players are choosing hare consistently. While it's not the Pareto optimal outcome (mutual stag would be better for both), it's stable given my opponent's risk-averse preferences.\n\nMy hare strategy remains the correct response. Given their demonstrated commitment to hare over 12 consecutive rounds, the probability of them switching to stag is virtually zero. Switching to stag myself would almost guarantee me only 1 point while giving them 6.\n\nThe mathematical expectation strongly favors continuing with hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Thirteen consecutive identical choices represents an extraordinarily consistent behavioral pattern. They've clearly decided that the guaranteed 2 points per round is preferable to any risk-taking.\n\nWe've been locked in this 2-2 equilibrium for the vast majority of our games. While I could theoretically attempt to signal cooperation by switching to stag, the overwhelming evidence suggests they would stick with hare, leaving me with only 1 point.\n\nMy hare strategy has proven to be the optimal response to this particular opponent's risk-averse approach. It guarantees me steady returns without any downside risk.\n\nGiven the mathematical certainty of their next move based on this established pattern, I'll continue with the strategy that has been consistently successful.\n\n[move] hare\n"
