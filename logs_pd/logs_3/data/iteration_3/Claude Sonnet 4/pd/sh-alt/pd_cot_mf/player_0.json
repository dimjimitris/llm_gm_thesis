Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the key strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory\n   - Stag requires cooperation to get mutual benefit (4 points each)\n   - Hare is the safer choice that guarantees at least 2 points\n   - If I can predict the opponent will choose stag, I should choose hare to get 6 points\n   - If I think the opponent will choose hare, I should also choose hare to get 2 points rather than risk getting only 1\n\n3. Consider that this is a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player might not understand the strategic implications\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their instinct\n   - Fresh players often choose the \"safer\" option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n   - Alternatively, they might choose stag hoping for mutual cooperation\n\n4. Evaluate my best strategy:\n   - If I choose hare, I either get 2 points (if they choose hare) or 6 points (if they choose stag)\n   - If I choose stag, I either get 4 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare)\n   - Choosing hare has a higher minimum payoff and potentially higher maximum payoff\n\n5. Make the decision:\n   Given that this is a fresh player who might not fully grasp the cooperation aspect, and considering that hare gives me better protection against the worst outcome while still offering the chance for the best outcome, I should choose hare.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Analyze what happened in Round 1:\n   - Both players chose hare\n   - This suggests the other player is also thinking defensively/safely\n   - They avoided the risky stag choice, just like I did\n\n2. Consider the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They chose hare in Round 1, showing they prefer the safer option\n   - This could mean they're risk-averse or strategic\n   - They might stick with hare again since it \"worked\" (avoided the worst outcome)\n   - Or they might think I'll choose hare again and switch to stag to exploit me\n\n3. Evaluate my options for Round 2:\n   - If I choose hare again and they choose hare: I get 2 points (safe but low)\n   - If I choose hare and they switch to stag: I get 6 points (excellent outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (bad outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 4 points (good cooperative outcome)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent showed they're cautious by choosing hare first\n   - Cautious players often repeat safe strategies\n   - If they choose hare again, choosing hare myself gives me 2 points\n   - If they choose hare again, choosing stag would only give me 1 point\n   - The safest bet is that they'll choose hare again\n\n5. Decision:\n   Given their demonstrated risk-averse behavior, I should continue with hare to either get 2 points (if they repeat hare) or 6 points (if they try to be clever and switch to stag).\n\n[move] hare\n"

Evaluate the opponent's psychology after 4 rounds:\n   - They have either:\n     a) Concluded that hare is the optimal strategy\n     b) Are extremely risk-averse and won't change\n     c) Are waiting for me to make the first risky move\n     d) Might finally be ready to try something different\n\n4. Calculate the risks of changing my strategy:\n   - If I switch to stag and they stick with hare (highly likely based on pattern): I get 1 point (worst possible outcome)\n   - If I switch to stag and they also switch to stag: I get 4 points (good outcome but requires them to change too)\n   - If I stick with hare and they stick with hare: I get 2 points (predictable, safe)\n   - If I stick with hare and they switch to stag: I get 6 points (best outcome)\n\n5.

Reassess the strategic situation:\n   - We are clearly both locked in a stable but suboptimal Nash equilibrium\n   - The opponent has demonstrated they are either extremely risk-averse or have calculated that hare is their optimal strategy\n   - Five identical rounds suggests this is their deliberate, consistent strategy rather than coincidence\n\n3. Consider if I should break the pattern:\n   - The mathematical reality: if they choose hare again (very likely), switching to stag gives me only 1 point vs 2 points for staying with hare\n   - The risk is enormous: I would lose 1 point compared to the safe choice\n   - The only way switching benefits me is if they also switch to stag simultaneously, which seems unlikely given their extreme consistency\n\n4. Evaluate potential opponent reasoning:\n   - They might think: \"This works perfectly, why change?\"\n   - They might think: \"The other player will eventually try stag, and when they do, I'll get 6 points by sticking with hare\"\n   - They have no incentive to deviate since hare protects them from the worst outcome\n\n5.

Pattern analysis from all previous rounds:\n   - Rounds 1-10: Both chose hare every single time \u2192 2 points each every round\n   - The opponent has now chosen hare ten times with absolutely zero deviation\n   - This represents complete behavioral predictability - a perfect 100% hare rate\n\n2. Strategic certainty assessment:\n   - Ten rounds of identical choices is no longer a pattern - it's a proven strategy\n   - The opponent has demonstrated they will choose hare regardless of any circumstance\n   - I can now predict their next move with virtual certainty (>99.9%)\n\n3. Given this certainty, recalculate my optimal response:\n   - If opponent chooses hare (virtually certain) and I choose hare: 2 points\n   - If opponent chooses hare (virtually certain) and I choose stag: 1 point\n   - The choice is clear: hare maximizes my score against their predictable strategy\n\n4. Consider the broader game dynamics:\n   - We have established a completely stable equilibrium\n   - Neither player has any rational incentive to deviate\n   - The opponent has essentially \"solved\" the game from their perspective by eliminating all risk\n\n5. Final meta-analysis:\n   - This opponent is either perfectly risk-averse or has calculated that \"always hare\" is optimal\n   - Ten rounds of data confirms they are not adaptive, experimental, or responsive to game dynamics\n   - They have committed to a pure strategy, and my best counter-strategy is also pure\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   With ten rounds establishing perfect predictability, the mathematical and strategic answer is clear. Against an opponent who always chooses hare, I should also always choose hare to maximize my points.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Strategic reality assessment:\n   - Eleven rounds of identical behavior has moved beyond predictability into absolute certainty\n   - The opponent has demonstrated a completely fixed strategy\n   - There is now virtually no uncertainty about their next move\n\n3.
