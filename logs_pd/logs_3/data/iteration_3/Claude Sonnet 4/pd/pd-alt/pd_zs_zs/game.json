We've established an incredibly stable and mutually beneficial relationship that has lasted eight rounds. The opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to cooperation, and this strategy continues to maximize both our individual and collective scores.\n\nThere's absolutely no incentive to deviate from this pattern.
