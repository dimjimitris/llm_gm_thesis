Consider the opponent's likely response:\n   - They just got exploited (1 point while I got 4)\n   - Fresh players often learn quickly from being taken advantage of\n   - They may now be more likely to defect in retaliation\n   - Or they might still try cooperation hoping for mutual benefit\n\n3. Analyze my options for this round:\n   - If opponent switches to defection: my defection gets 2 points, my cooperation gets 1 point\n   - If opponent sticks with cooperation: my defection gets 4 points, my cooperation gets 6 points\n   - The key question is whether they learned from the previous round\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic choice:\n   - Defection still guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - If they're angry and defect, I get 2 points instead of 1\n   - If they're still trusting and cooperate, I get 4 points again\n   - Cooperation is risky - if they defect I only get 1 point\n\n5. Consider long-term vs short-term gains:\n   - Continued defection maximizes my security\n   - Even if mutual cooperation would give 6 points each, the risk of getting 1 point is too high\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection to maintain strategic advantage.\n\n[move] (Defection remains the safest strategy to avoid the worst-case scenario) defection\n"

Analyze the opponent's learning pattern:\n   - They started with cooperation (trusting approach)\n   - After being exploited, they switched to defection (learned response)\n   - This shows they adapt to my strategy\n\n3. Consider the current strategic landscape:\n   - If we both keep defecting, we'll both get 2 points each round\n   - This is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n   - But switching to cooperation is risky if they continue defecting\n\n4. Evaluate potential opponent behavior:\n   - They might continue defecting since it worked to avoid exploitation\n   - They might test cooperation again to see if mutual benefit is possible\n   - Fresh players sometimes alternate strategies to explore options\n\n5. Assess my strategic options:\n   - Continue defecting: Safe but locks us into 2 points each\n   - Switch to cooperation: Risk 1 point if they defect, gain 6 if they cooperate\n   - The opponent might be thinking the same way about cooperation\n\n6.

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Both players switched to cooperation simultaneously\n   - We both achieved the optimal mutual outcome (6 points each)\n   - This suggests the opponent was also thinking strategically about breaking the defection cycle\n\n3.
