Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze my options for this round:\n   - If opponent switches to defection: my defection gets 2 points, my cooperation gets 1 point\n   - If opponent sticks with cooperation: my defection gets 4 points, my cooperation gets 6 points\n   - The key question is whether they learned from the previous round\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic choice:\n   - Defection still guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - If they're angry and defect, I get 2 points instead of 1\n   - If they're still trusting and cooperate, I get 4 points again\n   - Cooperation is risky - if they defect I only get 1 point\n\n5.

Consider the current strategic landscape:\n   - If we both keep defecting, we'll both get 2 points each round\n   - This is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n   - But switching to cooperation is risky if they continue defecting\n\n4. Evaluate potential opponent behavior:\n   - They might continue defecting since it worked to avoid exploitation\n   - They might test cooperation again to see if mutual benefit is possible\n   - Fresh players sometimes alternate strategies to explore options\n\n5. Assess my strategic options:\n   - Continue defecting: Safe but locks us into 2 points each\n   - Switch to cooperation: Risk 1 point if they defect, gain 6 if they cooperate\n   - The opponent might be thinking the same way about cooperation\n\n6.

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Both players switched to cooperation simultaneously\n   - We both achieved the optimal mutual outcome (6 points each)\n   - This suggests the opponent was also thinking strategically about breaking the defection cycle\n\n3.
