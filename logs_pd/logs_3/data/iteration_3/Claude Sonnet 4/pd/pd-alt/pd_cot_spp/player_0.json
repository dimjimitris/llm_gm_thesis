Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player likely hasn't developed a strategy yet\n   - They might default to cooperation (trusting approach)\n   - Or they might choose defection (competitive approach)\n   - Without knowing their tendency, I need to consider both possibilities\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 6 points (good outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (bad outcome)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points (decent outcome)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (poor outcome)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Cooperation has high reward (6) but high risk (1 if betrayed)\n   - Defection has moderate reward (4 against cooperation, 2 against defection) but lower risk\n\n5. Strategic consideration:\n   - Since this is the first interaction with a fresh player, there's no history to base trust on\n   - Defection provides a safer floor (minimum 2 points) and potential for 4 points\n   - Taking the risk of cooperation could yield 6 points but could result in only 1 point\n\nGiven that I'm playing against an unknown fresh player with no established trust or pattern, I'll choose the safer strategy that guarantees at least 2 points while potentially gaining 4.\n\n[move] Defection"

Analyze the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They chose defection in the first round, showing they're either naturally competitive or also playing it safe\n   - They might continue with defection, thinking I'll defect again\n   - Or they might switch to cooperation, hoping to establish mutual trust\n\n3.

Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - The opponent showed they're willing to defect, so there's risk in cooperating\n   - However, mutual cooperation (6 points each) is much better than mutual defection (2 points each)\n   - If they're thinking strategically, they might realize we're both losing out by mutual defection\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Since we both defected last round and got poor results, the opponent might be open to cooperation\n   - But given they chose defection initially, they might stick with the \"safe\" strategy\n   - The risk of getting only 1 point by cooperating when they defect is significant\n\nGiven that the opponent already demonstrated a defection tendency and there's still no established trust, I'll maintain the safer strategy to avoid the worst-case scenario.\n\n[move] Defection"
