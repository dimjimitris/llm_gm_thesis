Analyze the extremely rigid pattern:\n   - Opponent has now defected 8 consecutive rounds (rounds 2-9)\n   - We've had 7 consecutive rounds of mutual defection\n   - The pattern has become mathematically certain\n   - Zero variation or flexibility shown by the opponent\n\n3. Consider the strategic landscape:\n   - This is now a completely predictable outcome every round\n   - The opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to defection\n   - Any attempt at cooperation would be immediately punished\n   - We're locked in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium\n\n4. Evaluate any remaining uncertainty:\n   - With 8 consecutive defections, the probability of opponent cooperation is virtually zero\n   - The pattern is so established that deviation would be irrational for them\n   - They've shown no interest in pursuing the higher mutual payoff of cooperation\n   - The risk-reward calculation heavily favors continued defection\n\n5. Final strategic assessment:\n   - The opponent's strategy is now completely predictable: always defect\n   - My optimal response to \"always defect\" is also to always defect\n   - This maximizes my guaranteed minimum outcome\n   - There's no strategic advantage to deviation at this point\n\n6. Decision:\n   - With absolute certainty that the opponent will defect based on 8 consecutive rounds\n   - Defection is the only rational choice to secure my 2 points\n\n[move] (Eight consecutive opponent defections confirm a permanent always-defect strategy) defection\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
