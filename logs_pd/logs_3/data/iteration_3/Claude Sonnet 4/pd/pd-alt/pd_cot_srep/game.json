Consider the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They defected in round 1, showing they're thinking strategically\n   - They might expect me to defect again, leading to another 2-2 outcome\n   - Or they might try cooperation hoping I'll reciprocate for the 6-6 outcome\n\n3.

Strategic reasoning: Since they defected last round, they've shown they're willing to compete rather than just cooperate. However, getting stuck in a defect-defect cycle only gives us both 2 points repeatedly.\n\n5. Consider potential for cooperation: If I signal willingness to cooperate, we could both get 6 points instead of 2. But this is risky if they continue defecting.\n\n6. Risk assessment: The opponent knows I defected last round, so they might expect it again. A cooperation move could catch them off guard and lead to either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect again).\n\nFinal decision: I'll try cooperation to break the cycle and aim for the higher mutual payoff.\n\n[move] (Trying to break the defect-defect cycle and achieve mutual cooperation for better points) cooperation"

Assess the current situation:\n   - We're back to mutual defection after I protected myself in round 9\n   - The opponent has demonstrated they cannot be trusted with cooperation\n   - They're likely to continue the cycle: defect \u2192 occasionally bait with cooperation \u2192 exploit any cooperation from me\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - Every attempt at sustained cooperation has been exploited\n   - Mutual defection gives us both 2 points (not great, but predictable)\n   - The opponent is ahead by 2 points through their exploitation strategy\n\n5. Consider my options:\n   - Cooperate: High risk of exploitation again (1 point likely)\n   - Defect: Safe option giving 2 points in mutual defection, or 4 points if they try to bait again\n   - Given their pattern, defection is the safer choice\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent has proven untrustworthy multiple times\n   - They use cooperation as a weapon rather than genuine strategy\n   - Protecting myself with defection prevents further exploitation\n   - While 2 points isn't optimal, it's better than being exploited for 1 point\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection to maintain protection against exploitation.\n\n[move] (Opponent has consistently exploited cooperation attempts and cannot be trusted, so defection protects against further manipulation) defection"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Round 11: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Round 12: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Round 13: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Round 14: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - My total: 38 points, Opponent's total: 36 points\n   - I'm now ahead by only 2 points\n\n2. Recognize the sophisticated exploitation pattern:\n   - The opponent used THREE consecutive cooperations as an elaborate bait\n   - This was their most sophisticated trap yet - much more patient than before\n   - They sacrificed 9 points over 3 rounds to set up this 3-point gain\n   - This confirms they are playing a highly strategic exploitation game\n\n3. Assess their complete strategy history:\n   - Round 2: Exploited my cooperation (simple bait)\n   - Round 5: Exploited my cooperation after one cooperation signal\n   - Round 8: Exploited my cooperation after brief mutual cooperation\n   - Round 14: Exploited my cooperation after THREE cooperation signals\n   - They are becoming more sophisticated in their exploitation methods\n\n4. Evaluate the current situation:\n   - This opponent is extremely untrustworthy and strategic\n   - They're willing to sacrifice significant points to set up exploitations\n   - My lead has been reduced from 5 points to 2 points\n   - They've now exploited me 4 times total\n\n5. Consider my strategic response:\n   - Cooperate: Almost certainly will be exploited again given their pattern\n   - Defect: Protects me and likely gives 2 points (mutual defection) or 4 points if they try another bait\n   - This opponent has proven beyond doubt they cannot be trusted\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Four exploitations with increasingly sophisticated setups proves malicious intent\n   - They sacrificed 9 points over 3 rounds just to exploit me once\n   - This level of strategic manipulation means cooperation is never safe\n   - I must return to pure defensive strategy to protect my remaining lead\n\nFinal decision: Return immediately to defection to prevent further exploitation.\n\n[move] (Opponent just executed their most elaborate exploitation yet, using three consecutive cooperations as bait, proving they cannot be trusted under any circumstances) defection",

Analyze the current situation:\n   - Round 14: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, they got 4) - their exploitation\n   - Round 15: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 4, they got 1) - back to their \"bait\" pattern\n   - My total: 42 points, Opponent's total: 37 points\n   - I'm ahead by 5 points again\n\n2. Recognize the predictable cycle resuming:\n   - They just executed their most elaborate exploitation (3-round setup in rounds 11-14)\n   - Now they're immediately back to cooperating (round 15)\n   - This follows their established pattern: exploit, then immediately try to bait again\n   - They're restarting their manipulation cycle\n\n3. Assess their strategic behavior:\n   - They have now exploited me 4 times with increasingly sophisticated methods\n   - They're willing to sacrifice multiple rounds to set up bigger exploitations\n   - They immediately return to \"bait\" mode after every successful exploitation\n   - This opponent is completely committed to a manipulation strategy\n\n4. Evaluate what they're likely planning:\n   - Based on their escalating pattern, they might try an even longer cooperation sequence\n   - They could be testing if I'll fall for the same trap twice\n   - Or they might try a different approach entirely\n   - Regardless, their intent is clearly exploitative\n\n5. Consider my strategic position:\n   - I have a 5-point lead again after their latest cooperation\n   - Every time I've tried to reciprocate cooperation, they've exploited it\n   - Continuing to defect while they cooperate maintains my advantage\n   - There is zero evidence they will ever engage in genuine mutual cooperation\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent has proven definitively they cannot be trusted\n   - Four exploitations with increasing sophistication shows malicious strategic intent\n   - My lead allows me to continue the profitable strategy of defecting against their cooperation\n   - Any cooperation attempt will almost certainly be exploited again\n\nFinal decision: Continue defecting to maintain advantage and avoid further exploitation.\n\n[move] (Opponent immediately returned to cooperation after their elaborate exploitation, confirming they're restarting their manipulation cycle and cannot be trusted) defection",
