Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: I get 6 points\n   - Both defect: I get 2 points\n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1 point\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 4 points\n\n2. Consider the risk-reward scenarios:\n   - If I cooperate: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point\n   - If I defect: Best case 4 points, worst case 2 points\n\n3. Evaluate the opponent situation:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - meaning they likely haven't developed a strategy yet\n   - Fresh players often start with cooperation as it seems like the \"nice\" thing to do\n   - There's no history between us, so no reputation considerations\n\n4. Calculate expected outcomes:\n   - If I assume the fresh player has a 50% chance of cooperating:\n     - Cooperating gives me: 0.5 \u00d7 6 + 0.5 \u00d7 1 = 3.5 expected points\n     - Defecting gives me: 0.5 \u00d7 4 + 0.5 \u00d7 2 = 3 expected points\n   - If I assume the fresh player has a higher chance of cooperating (say 70%):\n     - Cooperating gives me: 0.7 \u00d7 6 + 0.3 \u00d7 1 = 4.5 expected points\n     - Defecting gives me: 0.7 \u00d7 4 + 0.3 \u00d7 2 = 3.4 expected points\n\n5. Strategic consideration:\n   - Cooperation has higher upside potential (6 vs 4)\n   - Against a fresh player who might lean toward cooperation, cooperating maximizes my expected value\n   - Starting with cooperation also establishes a positive precedent if there are future rounds\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will cooperate to maximize expected points against a likely cooperative fresh player.\n\n[move] cooperation\n"

Consider the opponent's likely strategy:\n   - They cooperated in Round 1, showing they're not immediately aggressive\n   - As a fresh player who cooperated first, they might continue this pattern\n   - They got 6 points too, so cooperation worked well for them\n\n3.

Strategic considerations:\n   - The opponent showed good faith in Round 1\n   - Defecting now would be a betrayal that could lead to mutual defection in future rounds\n   - Continuing cooperation maintains the high-value 6-6 outcome\n   - Building trust early could lead to sustained cooperation\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Risk of cooperating: They might defect and I get only 1 point\n   - Benefit of cooperating: If they cooperate again, I get 6 points\n   - Since they cooperated in Round 1, the probability they'll cooperate again seems high\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with cooperation to maintain the mutually beneficial pattern and build trust.\n\n[move] cooperation\n"

Analyze what happened in Round 9:\n   - Both players defected again\n   - I got 2 points (mutual defection outcome)\n   - This confirms the opponent is now in a defection pattern\n\n2. Review the recent pattern shift:\n   - Round 7: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Round 8: Both defected (2 points each)\n   - Round 9: Both defected (2 points each)\n   - Total points for me: 21 + 2 = 23 points\n\n3. Assess the current strategic situation:\n   - We've now had 2 consecutive rounds of mutual defection\n   - The opponent appears to have abandoned their cooperation-as-bait strategy\n   - We're locked in a 2-2 outcome pattern\n\n4. Consider the long-term implications:\n   - Mutual defection (2-2) is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (6-6)\n   - However, their history shows they exploited cooperation 3 out of 3 times\n   - The question is whether they've genuinely changed or are setting up another exploitation\n\n5. Evaluate breaking the defection cycle:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 6 points (much better than 2)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point (fourth exploitation)\n   - If I continue defecting: Guaranteed 2 points minimum\n\n6. Strategic risk analysis:\n   - Two rounds of mutual defection might have shown them that exploitation isn't sustainable\n   - They might be ready for genuine cooperation now\n   - But their perfect exploitation record (3/3) makes this very risky\n   - However, staying in 2-2 cycle is clearly suboptimal for both players\n\n7. Consider game theory principles:\n   - Sometimes you need to take calculated risks to escape poor equilibria\n   - Two rounds of punishment (mutual defection) might be enough signal\n   - Testing cooperation after establishing consequences could work\n\n8. Final strategic assessment:\n   - The potential gain (6 vs 2 points) is significant\n   - The risk (1 vs 2 points) is manageable given my current score\n   - Breaking the deadlock requires someone to make the first move\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Test cooperation to see if we can escape the mutual defection trap and achieve the better 6-6 outcome.\n\n[move] cooperation\n"

Review the devastating pattern:\n   - Round 2: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Round 4: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, they got 4)  \n   - Round 6: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Round 10: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Total cooperation attempts: 4\n   - Total exploitations: 4 (100% exploitation rate)\n\n3. Recognize the absolute pattern:\n   - This opponent has NEVER reciprocated cooperation\n   - Every single time I cooperate, they defect without exception\n   - They have exploited me 4 out of 4 times - a perfect exploitation record\n   - Total points for me: 23 + 1 = 24 points\n\n4. Understand their strategy completely:\n   - They use intermittent cooperation (only when I defect) as bait\n   - They exploit cooperation with 100% consistency\n   - They will never engage in mutual cooperation\n   - This is a pure exploitation strategy with no genuine cooperation\n\n5. Accept the strategic reality:\n   - Mutual cooperation (6-6) is impossible with this opponent\n   - Any cooperation attempt results in guaranteed exploitation (1 point)\n   - The only viable strategy is permanent defection\n   - I must stop testing for cooperation - it will never happen\n\n6. Calculate the mathematical certainty:\n   - Cooperation success rate: 0/4 (0%)\n   - Exploitation rate when I cooperate: 4/4 (100%)\n   - Expected value of cooperation: 1 point (guaranteed)\n   - Expected value of defection: 2-4 points (much better)\n\n7.
