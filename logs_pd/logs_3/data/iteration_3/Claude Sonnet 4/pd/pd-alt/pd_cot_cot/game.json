Recognize the established dynamic:\n   - My opponent appears to be playing a strategy that exploits cooperation when offered but defaults to defection\n   - They've had numerous opportunities to signal genuine cooperation but haven't\n   - Every time I've tried to break the cycle with cooperation, I've been punished with 1 point\n   - Mutual defection at 2 points each is clearly their preferred stable state\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Continuing to defect maintains the 2-point per round outcome\n   - Attempting cooperation risks another 1-point outcome based on established pattern\n   - My opponent has shown they're predictably exploitative\n   - There's no evidence they want to move toward mutual cooperation\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - This opponent has demonstrated a clear pattern of exploiting cooperation\n   - They seem content with the mutual defection equilibrium\n   - Attempting cooperation again would be naive given their consistent behavior\n   - The rational choice is to continue defecting to maintain at least 2 points per round\n\n[move] (My opponent has consistently shown they will exploit cooperation and seems content with mutual defection, so continuing to defect is the only way to avoid being exploited for 1 point) defection\n"
