Assess opponent's likely state:\n   - They may be increasingly frustrated with the 2-2 outcomes\n   - After three rounds of mutual defection, they might consider breaking the cycle\n   - However, their track record shows they exploit cooperation 100% of the time\n   - They've shown no indication of genuine reciprocal cooperation\n\n4. Consider risk vs. reward analysis:\n   - Cooperation: 1 point if exploited (very likely based on history) vs. 6 points if reciprocated (never happened)\n   - Defection: 2 points if mutual defection (current pattern) vs. 4 points if they cooperate (possible after long stalemate)\n   - My lead is substantial at 24 points\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has never reciprocated cooperation in the entire game\n   - Extended mutual defection might make them more likely to attempt cooperation\n   - My strong point lead allows me to maintain the safer strategy\n   - If they break first and cooperate, I gain 4 points; if not, I maintain status quo\n\n[move] (Maintaining proven strategy during extended mutual defection, opponent more likely to break cycle first) defection\n"

Consider strategic position:\n   - I have a very strong lead at 26 points\n   - The extended mutual defection actually protects my lead\n   - If the opponent gets frustrated and tries cooperation, I can capitalize for 4 points\n   - My risk tolerance should be lower given my strong position\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has never shown genuine reciprocal cooperation\n   - Four rounds of mutual defection increases the chance they might try cooperation\n   - My substantial lead means I should prioritize protecting my advantage\n   - Defection guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4 if they break first\n\n[move] (Four rounds of mutual defection increases likelihood opponent will attempt cooperation first, maintaining defensive advantage) defection\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
