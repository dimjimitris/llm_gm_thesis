They defected when I defected, giving us both 2 points, which fits the pattern I've observed:\n\nRecent sequence when I consistently defect:\n- They cooperate (I get 4)\n- They defect (I get 2) \n- They cooperate (I get 4)\n- They defect (I get 2)\n- They cooperate (I get 4)\n- They defect (I get 2)\n\nMy opponent is clearly alternating their response to my defection, switching between cooperation and defection. If this pattern holds, they should cooperate next round when I defect, giving me 4 points again.\n\nThis alternating pattern when I defect gives me an average of 3 points per round (4+2)/2 = 3, which is quite good. Meanwhile, every time I've tried cooperation in this game, they've exploited it for 4-1 in their favor.\n\nThe strategy is clear: keep defecting to maintain this favorable alternating pattern rather than risk cooperation and almost certain exploitation.\n\n[move] (Exploiting the predictable alternating pattern by continuing defection to get the expected 4 points this round) defection\n"
