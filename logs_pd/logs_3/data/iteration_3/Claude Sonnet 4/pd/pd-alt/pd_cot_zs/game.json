My opponent cooperated when I cooperated in round 3, giving us both 6 points - the best possible outcome.\n\nLet me analyze the pattern:\n- Round 1: I cooperated, they defected \u2192 I got 1 point\n- Round 2: I defected, they defected \u2192 I got 2 points  \n- Round 3: I cooperated, they cooperated \u2192 I got 6 points\n- Total so far: 9 points\n\nThis suggests my opponent might be using a \"Tit-for-Tat\" or similar responsive strategy:\n- They defected initially (maybe testing or being cautious)\n- They matched my defection in round 2\n- They cooperated when I cooperated in round 3\n\nThis is promising! If they're willing to cooperate when I cooperate, we can both benefit from mutual cooperation going forward. The 6-6 outcome is much better than the 2-2 outcome from mutual defection, and certainly better than the 1-4 split when I'm exploited.\n\nI should continue cooperating to see if we can establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, which would maximize both our scores.\n\n[move] (They responded positively to cooperation last round - let's see if we can maintain mutual cooperation for optimal outcomes) cooperation\n"

This is exactly what we want - mutual cooperation that maximizes both players' scores.\n\nThere's no reason to break this positive cycle. Defecting now would likely cause them to defect in response, returning us to the inferior outcomes we experienced in the early rounds.
