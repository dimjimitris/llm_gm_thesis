Consider the strategic implications:\n   - If I assume the opponent will cooperate, defecting gives me 4 points vs 6 points for cooperating\n   - If I assume the opponent will defect, defecting gives me 2 points vs 1 point for cooperating\n   - So defection dominates cooperation from a pure self-interest perspective\n\n3. However, consider the opponent's reasoning:\n   - They face the same payoff matrix and incentives\n   - If we both think this way, we both defect and get only 2 points each\n   - Mutual cooperation would give us both 6 points each\n\n4. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" with no history:\n   - I don't know their strategy or tendencies\n   - Starting with cooperation could signal willingness to work together\n   - But it also risks being exploited if they defect\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Cooperating: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point\n   - Defecting: Best case 4 points, worst case 2 points\n   - Defection has a higher floor but lower ceiling\n\nGiven that this is the first interaction with an unknown player, I'll choose defection to protect against the worst-case scenario while still having a chance at a decent payoff.\n\n[move] Defection\n"
