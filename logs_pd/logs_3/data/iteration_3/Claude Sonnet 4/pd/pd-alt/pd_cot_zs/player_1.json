You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

That's thirteen consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation, with both of us earning the maximum 6 points each round.\n\nThe pattern remains exceptionally stable:\n- Round 1: I cooperated, they defected (I got 1, they got 4)\n- Round 2: I defected, they cooperated (I got 4, they got 1)\n- Rounds 3-15: Both cooperated (we each got 6 points per round)\n\nWe have now maintained this remarkably successful cooperative relationship for thirteen straight rounds. This impressive streak demonstrates unwavering mutual commitment to the strategy that maximizes our individual and joint outcomes. The trust and predictability we've established has created a winning system that continues to deliver optimal results consistently.\n\nThis cooperative approach has been thoroughly validated by our sustained success.\n\n[move] (Maintaining our proven cooperative strategy that has delivered maximum points for thirteen consecutive rounds) cooperation\n"
