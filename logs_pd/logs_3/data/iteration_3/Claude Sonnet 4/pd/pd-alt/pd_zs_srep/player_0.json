This is a classic risk in repeated games.\n\nDespite this risk, the established pattern of cooperation is strong, and breaking it would likely lead to mutual defection in subsequent rounds (if there are any), which is worse for both players.

Defect - This could lead to mutual defection (2 points each) or punish them if they return to cooperation\n\nGiven that they broke the cooperative pattern, they've shown they're willing to prioritize individual gain over mutual benefit.

If they want to return to cooperation, they'll need to demonstrate that first.\n\nThis follows a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy - cooperate initially, then mirror the opponent's previous move.\n\n[move] (After being betrayed following our cooperative pattern, I need to respond with defection to avoid continued exploitation) defection\n"

The mutual defection was the natural consequence of the trust being broken in the previous round.\n\nNow I'm at a critical decision point. The other player has experienced the consequence of their betrayal - instead of continuing to exploit me, they got the lower payoff of mutual defection. This might make them reconsider their strategy.\n\nI have two main options:\n1. Continue defecting - This ensures I won't be exploited again, but locks us into the suboptimal 2-point outcomes\n2. Return to cooperation - This risks being exploited again, but offers the possibility of returning to the optimal 6-point mutual cooperation\n\nThe key question is whether the other player learned from the consequence of their defection. Since they defected this round (rather than trying to restore cooperation), they might continue with a defection strategy. However, they might also be thinking the same way I am about the benefits of returning to cooperation.\n\nGiven the risk-reward analysis, I think I should give cooperation one more chance.
