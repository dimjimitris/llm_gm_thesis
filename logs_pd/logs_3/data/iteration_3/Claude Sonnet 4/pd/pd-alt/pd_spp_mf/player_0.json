    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Avoid immediate exploitation if they're also thinking strategically\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If this is indeed repeated, cooperation makes sense as an opening move. It signals willingness to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome. We can always adapt based on their response. Starting with defection might trigger a defection spiral, reducing long-term payoffs.\n\n**Behavioral Strategist**: Agreed. Fresh players often mirror initial moves.

This gives us valuable information: the opponent is willing to cooperate, at least initially. This suggests they might be playing a cooperative strategy or testing the waters like we did.\n\n**Behavioral Strategist**: The fact that they also chose cooperation in the first round is very promising. Fresh players who start with cooperation often continue cooperating if it's reciprocated. However, we should be prepared that they might test defection to see if they can exploit us. The question is: should we continue cooperating to maintain the mutually beneficial outcome, or should we defect once to test their response?\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given that we achieved the best mutual outcome (6,6), I'm inclined to continue with cooperation. If they're genuinely cooperative, we'll both keep getting 6 points per round. If they're planning to defect, continuing cooperation at least gives them incentive to keep cooperating for mutual benefit.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I agree. In repeated prisoner's dilemma, a \"Tit-for-Tat\" strategy often works well - start with cooperation and then mirror the opponent's previous move. Since they cooperated, we should cooperate. This rewards their good behavior and maintains the high-payoff equilibrium.\n\n**Behavioral Strategist**: Exactly.

We're accumulating 12 points total so far. The opponent is demonstrating consistent cooperative behavior, which suggests they recognize the mutual benefit of this strategy. This is the ideal scenario in repeated prisoner's dilemma.\n\n**Behavioral Strategist**: This is very encouraging. The opponent appears to have settled into a cooperative strategy. Two rounds of cooperation suggest this isn't just random - they're likely committed to this approach, at least for now. However, we should remain vigilant. Sometimes players cooperate for a few rounds to build trust before attempting to exploit with defection.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The pattern is working perfectly. We're both maximizing our points through mutual cooperation. I see no reason to deviate from this successful strategy. Continuing to cooperate maintains the trust and keeps us both at the optimal payoff.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Agreed. In the absence of any defection from the opponent, the rational choice is to continue cooperating. We're in a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium.

In game theory terms, we've achieved sustained cooperation in a repeated prisoner's dilemma - the ideal outcome.\n\n**Behavioral Strategist**: This is textbook cooperative behavior from both sides. Three rounds establishes a clear pattern and demonstrates mutual trust. The opponent has had multiple opportunities to defect and exploit us, but hasn't taken them. This suggests they're either genuinely cooperative or recognize that sustained cooperation maximizes long-term gains for both players.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The strategy is working flawlessly. We're both consistently earning the maximum possible mutual benefit. There's no strategic reason to change course when we're in such a successful pattern. The opponent has proven reliable through three rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Absolutely. In repeated games, once you establish mutual cooperation, the rational choice is to maintain it. Any deviation risks destroying the trust and triggering a cycle of defection that reduces payoffs for everyone. \"Don't fix what isn't broken\" applies perfectly here.\n\n**Behavioral Strategist**: Completely agree.
