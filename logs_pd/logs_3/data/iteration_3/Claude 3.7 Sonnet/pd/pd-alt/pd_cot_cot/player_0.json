He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Eleven rounds of successful cooperation represents overwhelming evidence that both players are committed to the optimal long-term strategy of mutual cooperation.\n\n6. The probability that the other player will continue their cooperative strategy in the twelfth round is extremely high given their unwavering history across eleven rounds.\n\n7. At this stage, the history of cooperation is so extensive that it would be highly irrational for either player to deviate from a strategy that has been consistently optimal.\n\n8. Even after eleven rounds, the fundamental game theory remains unchanged - mutual cooperation continues to yield the highest sustainable payoff (6 points each) compared to any other outcome.\n\n9. There are no indications of changing game conditions or signals from the other player that would justify abandoning our successful cooperative approach.\n\n10. The extended length of our consistent cooperation suggests this is a long-term repeated interaction where maintaining the cooperative equilibrium continues to be the rational choice.\n\n[move] (After eleven continuous rounds of successful mutual cooperation establishing an exceptionally strong pattern of trust and optimal outcomes, continuing with cooperation remains the most rational and rewarding strategy) cooperation\n"
