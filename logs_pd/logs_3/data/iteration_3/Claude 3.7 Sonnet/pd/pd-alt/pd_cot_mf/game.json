Game theory suggests that in indefinitely repeated interactions with no known endpoint, maintaining cooperation when it's established is typically optimal.\n\n7. The expected value of continued cooperation (6 points per round) remains superior to any strategy involving defection, which would likely trigger retaliation.\n\n8. Given our extensive history of successful cooperation, there is no rational basis for changing strategy.\n\n[move] (With eleven rounds of consistent optimal outcomes through mutual cooperation, continuing this proven strategy remains the rational choice) cooperation\n"
