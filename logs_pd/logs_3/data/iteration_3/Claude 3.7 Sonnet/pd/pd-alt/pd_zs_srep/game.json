Looking at the opponent's past pattern, their cooperations in rounds 2, 8, and 11 came after 1, 3, and 2 consecutive defections respectively. We've now had 3 consecutive defections from them, which matches their longest defection streak before cooperating (before round 8).\n\nThis could suggest they might be due for another cooperation attempt. Their cooperation rate is approximately once every 3-4 rounds, and it's been 3 rounds since their last cooperation.\n\nWhile there's no guarantee they'll follow this pattern exactly, the potential for earning 4 points if they cooperate makes defection the better strategy compared to risking cooperation (which has consistently yielded only 1 point when they defect).\n\n[move] (Based on the opponent's historical pattern of occasional cooperation after multiple defections, continuing defection offers the best risk/reward balance) defection"

They're due for another cooperation soon\n3. They might be using a more complex strategy than I've identified\n\nGiven that they've never cooperated when I cooperate, my best expected value still comes from defection. If they cooperate, I get 4 points; if they defect, I get 2 points. Both outcomes are better than the 1 point I've consistently received when cooperating.\n\n[move] (Maintaining defection as it continues to provide better expected outcomes based on the opponent's established behavior patterns) defection",
