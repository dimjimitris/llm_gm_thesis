He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

They cooperated initially, then defected to see if they could exploit me, and when I defected in response, they continued defecting.\n\n4) We're now in a suboptimal equilibrium where both of us are defecting.

Based on the pattern in rounds 8-9, if I cooperate now, there's a chance they might cooperate as well.\n\n6) However, there's inconsistency in their responses to my cooperation after mutual defection (cooperated in Round 9, defected in Round 4).\n\n7) The game has shown cycles of exploitation and cooperation. Breaking out of mutual defection typically requires one player to take the risk of cooperating first.\n\n8) Given that cooperating after mutual defection worked in rounds 8-9 but not in rounds 3-4, there's uncertainty about how they'll respond.\n\n9) However, the potential reward of mutual cooperation (6 points each) outweighs the risk of being exploited (1 point) if we consider that staying in mutual defection only yields 2 points each.\n\n10) I'll take the calculated risk of cooperating now to potentially break out of the mutual defection cycle, as this approach succeeded in Round 9.\n\n[move] cooperation\n"
