In the absence of prior knowledge, cooperation is often a good starting strategy as it:\n   - Opens the possibility for mutual cooperation (highest joint reward)\n   - Signals willingness to work together\n   - Can establish trust for future rounds if this is part of a repeated game\n\n6. While defection provides protection against exploitation, starting with defection can lead to mutual defection cycles that are hard to break.\n\n7.

Since my opponent has established a pattern of defection (albeit from just one round), the rational response is to protect myself from being exploited repeatedly.\n\n5. In repeated prisoner's dilemma games, tit-for-tat (matching your opponent's previous move) is often an effective strategy.\n\n6. By defecting now, I also send a signal that I won't continue to be exploited, which might encourage cooperation in future rounds if this is part of a longer game.\n\n7.

My opponent had been following a strict alternating pattern (D,C,D,C...) for the first four rounds, but they broke this pattern in round 5 by defecting twice in a row.\n\n3. This suggests either:\n   - Their strategy has changed\n   - They may be responding to my moves in some way\n   - The alternating pattern was coincidental\n\n4. If they were truly alternating regardless of my moves, they should have cooperated in round 5, but they didn't.\n\n5.

Actually, this doesn't fit either. Their pattern seems inconsistent now.\n\n7.

One possibility is that my opponent is trying to establish mutual cooperation after the suboptimal round 5 where we both defected.\n\n6. Since mutual cooperation provides the highest total welfare (12 points total vs. 5 points in mixed strategies or 4 points in mutual defection), maintaining cooperation could be beneficial.\n\n7. If I cooperate and they continue to cooperate, we both get 6 points again, which is the optimal outcome.\n\n8.

Looking at this history more carefully, I notice my opponent might be using a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy:\n   - After round 1, they got 4 points (good outcome), so they cooperated next\n   - After round 2, they got 1 point (bad outcome), so they defected next\n   - After round 3, they got 4 points (good outcome), so they cooperated next\n   - After round 4, they got 1 point (bad outcome), so they defected next\n   - After round 5, they got 2 points (mediocre outcome), so they cooperated next\n   - After round 6, they got 6 points (best outcome), but they defected next - this breaks the pattern\n\n3.

My opponent has maintained their strict alternating pattern between defection and cooperation for all 11 rounds without a single deviation.\n\n4. Based on this extremely consistent pattern, I can predict with very high confidence that my opponent will choose cooperation in round 12.\n\n5. Given this prediction:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate (as predicted), we both get 6 points\n   - If I defect and they cooperate (as predicted), I get 4 points and they get 1 point\n\n6. While mutual cooperation would yield the highest total points (12), my strategy has been to maximize my individual score.\n\n7. In previous rounds when I've predicted cooperation from my opponent (rounds 2, 4, 8, and 10), I've consistently defected and received 4 points each time.\n\n8. Based on this analysis and the continued predictability of my opponent's alternating strategy, I will choose defection for this round to maximize my expected points.\n\n[move] Defection\n"
