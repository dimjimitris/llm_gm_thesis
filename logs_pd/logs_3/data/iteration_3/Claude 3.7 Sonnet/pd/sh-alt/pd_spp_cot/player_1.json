He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, and possibly 6 if the other player chooses stag.\n\n6. For the first move, I think showing willingness to cooperate can establish a positive pattern.

In all eleven previous rounds, both the other player and I have consistently chosen stag, resulting in 4 points for each of us in every round.\n\n2. This perfect consistency over eleven rounds demonstrates an extraordinarily robust cooperative relationship with unwavering mutual trust.\n\n3. The payoff structure remains:\n   - Stag-Stag: 4 points each (cooperative outcome)\n   - Hare-Hare: 2 points each (safe but suboptimal)\n   - Stag-Hare: 1 point for me, 6 points for them (I lose badly)\n   - Hare-Stag: 6 points for me, 1 point for them (I win big)\n\n4. We've now accumulated 44 points each through consistent cooperation, far exceeding what any other strategy would have yielded.\n\n5. After eleven rounds of perfect cooperation:\n   - The other player has demonstrated exceptional commitment to the cooperative strategy\n   - Our mutual trust is now firmly established beyond any reasonable doubt\n   - Both players have clearly demonstrated understanding of the long-term benefits of cooperation\n   - There's no indication of any change in game parameters or that the game is ending\n\n6. At this point in the game:\n   - The pattern of mutual cooperation is so well-established that it would be irrational to deviate\n   - Any temporary gain from defection (2 points at most) would be vastly outweighed by the likely future losses\n   - The consistent history strongly predicts continued mutual cooperation\n   - Breaking eleven rounds of perfect trust would be counterproductive to maximizing total points\n\n7. The evidence for continuing our established strategy is overwhelming. Both players have demonstrated remarkable consistency and understanding of optimal game theory strategy.\n\n8. The rational choice remains clear: continue with the cooperative approach that has proven successful for eleven consecutive rounds.\n\n[move] stag.
