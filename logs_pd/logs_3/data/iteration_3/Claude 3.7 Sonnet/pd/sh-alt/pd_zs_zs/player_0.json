However, choosing stag is risky because if my opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\nSince this is the first round with a new player, there's no history to base my decision on. The cooperative choice (stag) offers the best mutual outcome, but is vulnerable to exploitation. The safer choice (hare) guarantees at least 2 points.\n\nI'll start with a cooperative approach to establish a potential pattern of mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing stag because it offers the best outcome if we both cooperate, allowing us both to get 4 points.\n"
