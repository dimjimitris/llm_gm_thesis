The pattern is beyond question - they appear to be fixed on the hare strategy.\n\nGiven this overwhelming evidence and the consistent results from multiple tests when I chose stag, the rational choice remains clear:\n\n[move] hare With my opponent having chosen hare in 14 consecutive rounds without exception, I'm continuing with hare to secure the consistent 2 points rather than being exploited for 1 point. While this represents a suboptimal outcome compared to mutual cooperation, it is the best response to an opponent who has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to non-cooperation.\n"
