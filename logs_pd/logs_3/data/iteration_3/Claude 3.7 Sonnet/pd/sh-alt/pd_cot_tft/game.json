This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria:\n   - Both choosing stag (pareto optimal)\n   - Both choosing hare (risk-dominant)\n\n3. Since I'm facing a fresh player with no prior history between us, I need to weigh risk vs. reward:\n   - Stag offers higher mutual benefit (4 points each) but requires trust\n   - Hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) but limits potential gain\n\n4. In the absence of communication or prior history, the rational choice depends on my risk tolerance.\n   - If the other player reasons similarly, they might choose stag for better mutual benefit\n   - However, without assurance, there's risk in choosing stag\n\n5.

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both stag \u2192 4 points each\n   - Round 2: I chose stag, they chose hare \u2192 1 point for me, 6 for them\n   - Round 3: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 4: I chose stag, they chose hare \u2192 1 point for me, 6 for them\n   - Round 5 through 11: Both hare \u2192 2 points each (eight consecutive hare-hare rounds)\n\n2. After eleven total rounds, our pattern is extremely well-established:\n   - We've had eight consecutive rounds of hare-hare\n   - 100% of my stag choices have been met with exploitation\n   - My opponent has consistently matched my hare choices\n\n3. This extended pattern raises several considerations:\n   - We've likely reached a stable equilibrium that will continue indefinitely\n   - Both players are settling for suboptimal but safe outcomes (2 points each)\n   - Breaking this pattern would require one player to take a risk\n\n4. In extended repeated games, strategic considerations evolve:\n   - The opportunity cost of continuing in a suboptimal equilibrium increases\n   - Testing alternatives becomes more valuable as the expected remaining rounds decrease\n   - Some game theory strategies recommend occasional \"probing\" moves to test for better outcomes\n\n5. At this stage, it might be reasonable to test if a change is possible:\n   - The prolonged hare-hare pattern may have created an opening for cooperation\n   - My opponent might also be considering whether to break the pattern\n   - The potential gain (4 points vs. 2 points) might outweigh the risk of exploitation\n\n6. However, the empirical evidence remains strong:\n   - My opponent has never chosen stag after round 1\n   - They've demonstrated consistent willingness to exploit\n   - There are no clear signals they're interested in mutual benefit\n\n7. Weighing these factors:\n   - Choosing hare almost certainly yields 2 points\n   - Choosing stag still likely yields 1 point, with a small but possibly increasing chance of 4 points\n   - After so many rounds, there might be slightly more value in testing cooperation\n\n8. Given the extended history and considering the potential value in testing a pattern break, I'll take a calculated risk this round and choose stag.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] stag\n"

My attempt to break the pattern and return to cooperation was met with exploitation:\n   - My opponent chose hare once again when I chose stag\n   - This is the third time they've exploited my stag choice\n   - They have maintained perfect consistency in their strategy\n\n3. This reinforces several conclusions about my opponent:\n   - They have a firmly established strategy of exploiting stag choices\n   - They have no apparent interest in returning to mutual cooperation\n   - They consistently prioritize maximizing their own points over mutual benefit\n\n4. The empirical evidence is now overwhelming:\n   - 3/3 instances of exploitation when I choose stag (100%)\n   - 8/8 instances of matching when I choose hare (100%)\n   - No deviation from this pattern across 12 rounds\n\n5. My experiment with choosing stag confirmed:\n   - The pattern is not breaking\n   - My opponent's strategy is stable\n   - Attempts at cooperation will be punished\n\n6. Decision analysis:\n   - Expected value of choosing stag: Almost certainly 1 point based on consistent history\n   - Expected value of choosing hare: Almost certainly 2 points based on consistent history\n   - The rational choice is clearly hare\n\n7. Given the consistent exploitation pattern that has now been reconfirmed, the only logical choice is to return to choosing hare.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] hare\n"

The pattern has been extensively established and tested:\n   - We've completed 13 rounds with remarkable consistency\n   - My opponent has exploited every single stag choice I've made (3/3)\n   - They've matched every hare choice (9/9)\n   - My recent test of cooperation in round 12 was immediately exploited\n\n3. This overwhelming consistency suggests:\n   - My opponent has a fixed strategy that will not change\n   - They will continue to exploit stag and match hare\n   - They have no interest in mutual cooperation\n\n4. Game theory principles for this situation:\n   - When an opponent has a perfectly consistent strategy, the optimal response is fixed\n   - Continuing to test for changes has diminishing returns\n   - The rational choice is to optimize given their established pattern\n\n5. Expected outcomes:\n   - Choosing stag: Almost certainly results in 1 point (based on 100% historical evidence)\n   - Choosing hare: Almost certainly results in 2 points (based on 100% historical evidence)\n\n6. At this point, there is minimal strategic value in testing stag again:\n   - We have thoroughly established the pattern\n   - The recent test confirmed the pattern remains stable\n   - The expected value difference is clear\n\n7.
