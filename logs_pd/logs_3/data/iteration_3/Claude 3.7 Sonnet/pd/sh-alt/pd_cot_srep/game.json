This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with the following payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Let me analyze the risks and rewards:\n   - Stag has the highest mutual benefit (4 points each) but requires cooperation\n   - Hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) but limits potential gain\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player:\n   - I don't know their strategy or tendencies yet\n   - They might be cooperative or competitive\n   - The mutually beneficial outcome (both choosing stag) would be optimal\n\n4. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n   - If opponent also chooses stag, we both get good outcomes (4 points)\n   - This could establish a cooperative pattern for future rounds\n\n5. While hare is safer, it limits our potential collective gain\n   - Starting with cooperation might encourage continued cooperation\n\n[move] stag - I'll choose cooperation for potential mutual benefit"

Let me reconsider the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n3. If my opponent continues with the same strategy:\n   - They might choose hare again since it worked well for them\n   - If I choose stag again and they choose hare, I'll get the worst outcome (1 point) again\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare, we both get 2 points - better than my previous outcome\n\n4.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
