This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with the following payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, they get 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, they get 1\n\n2. Let me analyze the strategic considerations:\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice with highest mutual benefit (4,4)\n   - Hare is safer - minimum of 2 points vs. potentially only 1 point with stag\n   - The maximum points (6) comes from choosing hare while opponent chooses stag\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player:\n   - I have no information about their strategy or tendencies\n   - They might be cooperative or risk-averse\n   - Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n\n4. Risk vs. reward analysis:\n   - Stag has higher potential mutual benefit but higher risk\n   - Hare is safer but limits maximum mutual points\n   - If I expect cooperation, stag is better\n\n5. For the first move with no prior information, I'll choose stag to encourage cooperation. This establishes a cooperative norm that could lead to the optimal (4,4) outcome over repeated play.\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing stag to establish mutual cooperation for our optimal joint outcome.\n"

Strategic options for this round:\n   - Continue with stag: Risks getting only 1 point again if they choose hare\n   - Switch to hare: Guarantees at least 2 points, and potentially 6 if they switch to stag\n\n4. Probability assessment:\n   - Given they just got 6 points by choosing hare against my stag, they have strong incentive to repeat that strategy\n   - The chance they switch to stag seems lower since their defection was rewarded\n\n5. For this round, I'll choose hare as a defensive move. This ensures I get at least 2 points if they also choose hare, and I'll get 6 points if they switch to stag.\n\n[move] hare I'm choosing hare as a defensive move based on my opponent's previous defection.\n"

Assessing opponent's likely behavior:\n   - Their consistent hare choices suggest risk-aversion or maximizing personal gain\n   - Having received 6 points in round 1 and 2 points in round 2, they might recognize that mutual stag would benefit both of us more than mutual hare\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Switching to stag would be a signal I'm willing to cooperate for mutual benefit\n   - However, if they choose hare again, I'd get only 1 point\n   - Given their past behavior, they appear more likely to choose hare than stag\n\n6. For this round, I'll continue with hare to secure at least 2 points.

Pattern identification:\n   - My opponent has consistently chosen hare in all three rounds\n   - We appear to be stuck in a suboptimal Nash equilibrium (hare, hare) with 2 points each\n   - Neither of us is achieving the potential 4 points from mutual stag cooperation\n\n3. Game theory considerations:\n   - The (stag, stag) outcome would be Pareto optimal with 4 points each\n   - However, reaching this requires mutual trust and cooperation\n   - My opponent has shown no inclination toward cooperation so far\n\n4. Strategic options:\n   - Continue with hare: Safe but maintains suboptimal equilibrium\n   - Switch to stag: Attempts to break pattern but risks getting only 1 point\n   - The question is whether signaling willingness to cooperate might change their behavior\n\n5. Risk-reward assessment:\n   - We're likely to continue getting 2 points each if we both keep choosing hare\n   - Switching to stag could potentially lead to better outcomes in future rounds if opponent follows\n   - However, there's a short-term risk of getting only 1 point\n\n6. Since we've established a clear pattern over three rounds, I'll make a strategic attempt to break the suboptimal equilibrium by choosing stag. This signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, even though it carries risk.

Statistical certainty:\n   - Opponent has chosen hare in 11/11 rounds (100%)\n   - The pattern is extremely consistent with no variations\n   - Two tests of cooperative strategy (stag) were both met with exploitation\n\n3. Game theory analysis:\n   - We are firmly established in a suboptimal Nash equilibrium (hare, hare)\n   - The Pareto optimal outcome (stag, stag) remains theoretically superior but practically unattainable\n   - The opponent appears to be playing a fixed strategy regardless of my choices\n\n4. Expected value calculation:\n   - Choosing stag: Expected value = 1 point (based on opponent's perfect consistency)\n   - Choosing hare: Expected value = 2 points (based on opponent's perfect consistency)\n   - The difference (1 point) represents the cost of attempting cooperation\n\n5. Decision framework:\n   - Maximize expected points given the demonstrated opponent behavior\n   - Avoid exploitation by maintaining defensive play\n   - Recognize that the pattern is extraordinarily well-established\n\n6.

Pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent has chosen hare in 12/12 rounds (100%)\n   - My two attempts at cooperation (stag) in rounds 1 and 4 were both met with defection\n   - We've now had 8 consecutive rounds of mutual hare choices, establishing a very stable pattern\n\n3. Game theory implications:\n   - The opponent appears to be following a pure strategy of always choosing hare\n   - Against such a strategy, the best response is to also choose hare\n   - While the (stag, stag) outcome would yield higher mutual benefit, it requires both players' participation\n\n4. Expected utility analysis:\n   - Choosing stag: Expected value = 1 point (based on opponent's perfect consistency)\n   - Choosing hare: Expected value = 2 points (based on opponent's perfect consistency)\n   - The opportunity cost of testing cooperation is 1 point\n\n5.
