My opponent maintains their strict alternation between Hare and Stag when I consistently play Hare. They just played Stag in round 14, so I expect them to play Hare in round 15.\n\nMy current score is 54 points (1 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6).\n\nBased on the established pattern, my opponent will likely play Hare next. If I play:\n- Hare: We both get 2 points\n- Stag: I get 1 point, they get 6\n\nSince playing Stag against their expected Hare would be disadvantageous, I'll continue with Hare.\n\n[move] Hare.
