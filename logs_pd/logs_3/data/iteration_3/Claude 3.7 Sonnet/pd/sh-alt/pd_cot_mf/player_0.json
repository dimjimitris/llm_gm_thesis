He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I need to consider the incentives:\n   - The highest mutual benefit comes from both choosing stag (4 points each)\n   - Choosing hare is less risky since the worst outcome is 2 points vs. 1 point\n   - But choosing hare means giving up potential higher mutual reward\n\n3. This game is fundamentally about trust and cooperation vs. playing it safe:\n   - Stag represents cooperation, which has higher potential reward but risk of exploitation\n   - Hare represents caution, which limits downside but also caps upside\n\n4. For the first move, I think signaling willingness to cooperate may establish a positive pattern, and the highest mutual outcome comes from both choosing stag.\n\n5. If the other player is rational and also aims to maximize points, they should see that mutual stag hunting is optimal.\n\n[move] stag\n"

My opponent has not chosen stag in either round, suggesting they may be playing cautiously or strategically to maximize their own points.\n\n3. Let's consider the payoff structure again:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (mediocre but safe)\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, they get 6 (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, they get 1 (best for me)\n\n4.

Given that my opponent has shown a preference for hare so far, and I've already tried cooperating with stag in the first round with negative results, I think the safer play is to continue with hare.\n\n7. However, we may be stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium of both choosing hare (2 points each) versus both choosing stag (4 points each). At some point, one of us needs to signal willingness to cooperate.\n\n8.
