Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a classic stag hunt game where cooperation (stag-stag) yields good outcomes for both players, but there's risk involved.\n2. Let me analyze the possible outcomes:\n   - If both choose stag: I get 4 points and opponent gets 4 points (mutual cooperation)\n   - If both choose hare: I get 2 points and opponent gets 2 points (mutual defection)\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point and opponent gets 6 points (I lose badly)\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points and opponent gets 1 point (I win big)\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n4. The stag strategy has the highest mutual benefit (4 points each) but requires trust.\n5. The hare strategy is safer because the worst outcome is 2 points, whereas choosing stag could leave me with only 1 point.\n6. However, if we both choose hare, we only get 2 points each, which is suboptimal compared to mutual stag hunting.\n7. In the first round, I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n8. This could establish a pattern of cooperation if the other player is also rational.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Let me re-examine the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each (optimal mutual outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (suboptimal mutual outcome)\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point (best for me, worst for them)\n4. Since the opponent chose stag in the first round, they've demonstrated willingness to cooperate.\n5. If I continue choosing stag, and they do too, we both maintain the optimal mutual outcome of 4 points.\n6. There's temptation to choose hare to try to get 6 points, but this risks breaking cooperation.\n7. If I choose hare and they continue with stag, I would get 6 points this round, but they might switch to hare in future rounds.\n8. Maintaining stable cooperation (stag-stag) consistently yields more points over multiple rounds than alternating between hare and lower outcomes.\n9.
