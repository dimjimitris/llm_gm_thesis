He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, they get 6\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6, they get 1\n\n2. Let me analyze strategies:\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice that maximizes mutual benefit (4 points each)\n   - Hare is safer since I'd get at least 2 points, and possibly 6 if the other player chooses stag\n   - If the other player chooses stag, I'd benefit most from choosing hare (6 points)\n   - If the other player chooses hare, I'd benefit most from also choosing hare (2 points vs 1 point)\n\n3. Since this is a fresh player with no history, I need to decide whether to be risk-seeking or risk-averse:\n   - Cooperative play (stag) offers good mutual benefit (4 points)\n   - Hare is the \"safer\" play as it guarantees at least 2 points\n   - Since this is the first round, establishing cooperation could benefit us both in the long run\n\n4. I'll choose stag as an initial cooperative signal, hoping the other player also chooses stag so we can both get 4 points.\n\n[move] stag. I'm choosing stag as a cooperative opening move, hoping we can establish mutual trust for our benefit.\n"

Consider possible strategies for this round:\n   - Continue cooperation with stag, which would yield 4 points if the other player also continues\n   - Switch to hare, which could yield 6 points if the other player chooses stag again, but only 2 if they also switch\n\n3. Evaluate the other player's likely move:\n   - Since they chose stag in the first round, they showed willingness to cooperate\n   - They might continue with stag since it worked well for both of us\n   - However, they might also try to exploit by switching to hare\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Maintaining stag has potential for consistent good outcomes (4 points)\n   - Switching to hare could maximize my points if they stay with stag, but could reduce mutual benefit\n   - Since we established cooperation in the first round, maintaining it is valuable\n\n5.
