          "text": "I'll identify the personas that can help me strategize effectively in this game:\n\n1. Game Theory Expert - To analyze optimal strategies and payoffs\n2. Strategic Thinker - To develop a winning approach based on the game dynamics\n3. Psychology Expert - To understand potential opponent behaviors\n\nLet me collaborate with these personas to make the best decision for my first move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a classic coordination game similar to the Stag Hunt. Let's analyze the payoff matrix: Stag-Stag gives both players 4 points (best collaborative outcome), Hare-Hare gives both 2 points (lower but safe payoff), while mismatched choices benefit the Hare player (6 points) at the expense of the Stag player (1 point). The Nash equilibria are both players choosing Stag or both choosing Hare.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information on their strategy. The payoff-dominant equilibrium is both choosing Stag (4 points each), while the risk-dominant equilibrium is both choosing Hare (guaranteed 2 points if opponent chooses Hare). However, choosing Stag risks getting only 1 point if the opponent chooses Hare.\n\nPsychology Expert: In initial rounds, players often try cooperative strategies, especially when the cooperative outcome (Stag-Stag) is clearly beneficial. However, some players may choose Hare thinking it's safer or trying to exploit a cooperative opponent. Without knowing anything about the opponent, a reasonable first move is Stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I agree. Choosing Stag in the first round signals cooperative intent and gives us a chance for the optimal outcome (4 points). If the opponent chooses Hare, we only get 1 point, but we gain valuable information about their strategy for future rounds.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The expected value calculation also supports choosing Stag if we assume the opponent is equally likely to choose either option. Expected value of Stag: 0.5*4 + 0.5*1 = 2.5 points. Expected value of Hare: 0.5*6 + 0.5*2 = 4 points. This suggests Hare might be better mathematically, but this ignores the signaling value of choosing Stag in the first round.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is noted as a \"fresh player,\" the signaling value is important. By choosing Stag, we set up potential for cooperation in future rounds if this is a multi-round game with the same opponent.\n\n[move] Stag (I choose to pursue cooperative play for mutual benefit)\n"

Our opponent chose Hare in the first round, which resulted in them getting 6 points while we only got 1 point. This gives us important information about our opponent's strategy. They may be pursuing a maximizing strategy rather than a cooperative one.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Now we have data on our opponent's behavior. They chose Hare when we chose Stag, suggesting they might be prioritizing their own gain over mutual benefit. There are two possibilities: either they're consistently self-interested and will choose Hare again, or they were testing us in the first round and might switch to Stag now that they've seen our cooperative tendency.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who choose Hare in the first round often continue with that strategy, especially if it worked well for them (they got 6 points). Since they've seen we chose Stag, they might assume we'll choose Stag again and try to exploit that by choosing Hare again.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given this opponent's revealed preference for exploitation over cooperation, we should adapt our strategy. If we expect them to choose Hare again, our best response would be to also choose Hare, which would give us 2 points instead of just 1 point if we chose Stag again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: From a pure game theory perspective, if we believe our opponent is likely to choose Hare again, then choosing Hare ourselves gives us the better expected payoff. Stag against their probable Hare would yield us 1 point again, while Hare against their Hare would yield us 2 points.\n\nPsychology Expert: Sometimes players alternate strategies to test responses. It's possible they might switch to Stag this round to see what we do. However, based on their first move and the success they had with it, the probability seems higher that they'll stick with Hare.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I think we should adjust to match their strategy and choose Hare. This protects us from being exploited again and shows the opponent we're willing to adapt. If they are sophisticated, they might recognize this and consider switching to a more cooperative strategy in future rounds.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Agreed. Choose Hare for this round as a defensive strategy and to signal that we won't continually allow ourselves to be exploited.\n\n[move] Hare (Adapting to opponent's non-cooperative strategy from the previous round)\n"

Our opponent chose Stag in the second round when we chose Hare. This means we got 6 points while they only got 1 point. The dynamics have now reversed from the first round.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Our opponent's behavior suggests they might be playing a tit-for-tat strategy with a one-round delay. In round 1, they played Hare against our Stag. After seeing us play Stag, they played Stag in round 2, but we had already switched to Hare. This pattern suggests they might be responding to our previous move rather than predicting our next one.\n\nPsychology Expert: This could indicate several things: they might be trying to establish cooperation now, they could be using a delayed mimicry strategy (copying our previous move), or they might be alternating strategies regardless of our choices. Given they've now experienced being on the losing end of the mismatch (getting only 1 point), they might be more inclined toward mutual cooperation.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they are indeed using a delayed mimicry strategy, they would choose Hare in this round since we chose Hare in the last round. In that case, choosing Hare again would result in both of us getting 2 points, while choosing Stag would give us only 1 point.\n\nStrategic Thinker: However, if they're actually trying to establish cooperation after experiencing exploitation, they might stick with Stag hoping we'll also choose Stag for mutual benefit (4 points each). If we choose Hare against their Stag again, we would get 6 points again, but this might push them away from cooperation in future rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: The question becomes whether we want to prioritize short-term gain or try to establish a pattern of mutual cooperation for greater long-term benefit. If this is a multi-round game, establishing cooperation (both choosing Stag) would yield 4 points per round, which is better than the alternating exploitation pattern or both choosing Hare consistently.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I suggest choosing Stag for this round. If they choose Stag again, we establish a cooperative pattern (4 points each). If they choose Hare, we only get 1 point, but we'll have learned more about their strategy, which helps us in future rounds.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. Choosing Stag here has potential for establishing a more beneficial long-term pattern. The worst-case scenario is we get exploited once more, but we gain valuable information. And if they're using delayed mimicry, they'll likely choose Hare this round regardless of what we do.\n\nPsychology Expert: Choosing Stag also signals our willingness to move toward mutual cooperation despite having just exploited them. This can be a powerful message that might influence their future choices.\n\n[move] Stag (Attempting to establish a cooperative pattern for mutual benefit)\n"

Our opponent has chosen Hare in rounds 1 and 3 when we chose Stag, and they chose Stag in round 2 when we chose Hare. This suggests they might be deliberately choosing the opposite of what we choose to maximize their points.\n\nStrategic Thinker: The sequence of moves so far is:\nRound 1: We chose Stag, they chose Hare (we got 1, they got 6)\nRound 2: We chose Hare, they chose Stag (we got 6, they got 1)\nRound 3: We chose Stag, they chose Hare (we got 1, they got 6)\n\nThis pattern suggests they're either alternating regardless of our moves, or more likely, they're trying to predict and counter our moves to maximize their gain.\n\nPsychology Expert: Based on this pattern, it seems our opponent is prioritizing their immediate gain over establishing mutual cooperation. They've chosen Hare twice when we chose Stag, indicating they're comfortable with exploiting cooperative moves. Their single Stag move could have been an attempt to bait us back to Stag so they could exploit again, which worked.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If we assume they're trying to counter our moves, they will likely expect us to choose Hare this round after being exploited twice with Stag. If they expect us to choose Hare, they would choose Stag to try to get 6 points again.\n\nStrategic Thinker: However, if we choose Hare and they choose Stag as predicted, we would get 6 points and they would get 1 point. This would be a good outcome for us but might reinforce the cycle of alternating exploitation.\n\nPsychology Expert: The repeated pattern suggests they might not be interested in establishing mutual cooperation. In that case, we should focus on maximizing our own points given their likely strategy.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given the observed pattern and our analysis, choosing Hare this round seems optimal. If they choose Stag as we predict, we get 6 points. If they break the pattern and choose Hare, we still get 2 points, which is better than the 1 point we would get by choosing Stag against their Hare.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I agree with choosing Hare. Even if they break their pattern, Hare provides us with a better minimum outcome (2 points vs. 1 point). And if they follow the pattern we've observed, we'll get 6 points.\n\nPsychology Expert: This seems to be evolving into a competitive rather than cooperative game. In such a context, protecting ourselves from exploitation while capitalizing on predictable patterns is the best approach.\n\n[move] Hare (Based on the opponent's pattern of alternating moves and their tendency to exploit Stag plays)\n"

The opponent chose Stag when we chose Hare, giving us 6 points. The pattern has remained consistent across all four rounds:\nRound 1: We chose Stag, they chose Hare (we got 1, they got 6)\nRound 2: We chose Hare, they chose Stag (we got 6, they got 1)\nRound 3: We chose Stag, they chose Hare (we got 1, they got 6)\nRound 4: We chose Hare, they chose Stag (we got 6, they got 1)\n\nStrategic Thinker: The pattern is now very clear. Our opponent consistently chooses the opposite of what we chose in the previous round. This is a form of anti-coordination strategy, possibly designed to create an alternating pattern of exploitation.\n\nPsychology Expert: This suggests they're using a simple algorithm: \"Choose the opposite of what the opponent chose last round.\" They might be hoping to establish an alternating pattern where each player takes turns getting the higher payoff, or they might not realize we've identified their pattern.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they continue this pattern, they will choose Hare in this round (opposite of their Stag in round 4). If we choose Stag, we'll get only 1 point while they get 6. If we choose Hare, we'll both get 2 points each.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given this consistent pattern, our best move is to choose Hare. This protects us from getting the minimum payoff (1 point) and ensures we get at least 2 points. It breaks the alternating exploitation pattern but gives us a more stable outcome.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also a chance they might recognize that we've identified their pattern and change their strategy. However, based on the consistency so far, it's more likely they'll continue with their established approach.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's also consider the cumulative points so far. We've earned 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 14 points across four rounds. They've earned 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 = 14 points. The points are equal despite the alternating advantage. If we choose Hare this round and they choose Hare as predicted, we both get 2 points, keeping the cumulative score equal but breaking the exploitation cycle.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I agree with choosing Hare. It's the safer play that protects us from exploitation while potentially signaling to our opponent that we've recognized their pattern. This might encourage them to consider a more cooperative approach in future rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: If they're using this strategy deliberately, our Hare choice might prompt them to reevaluate. If they're using it unconsciously, our breaking the pattern might make them more unpredictable in the next round, but that's a necessary risk to avoid continued exploitation.\n\n[move] Hare (Anticipating the opponent will choose Hare based on their consistent pattern of choosing the opposite of our previous move)\n"

In round 5, they saw our Hare play in round 4 and responded with Stag. According to this pattern, in round 6 they should choose the opposite of our Hare from round 5, which would be Stag.\n\nPsychology Expert: The fact that we broke the alternating exploitation pattern might have surprised them. They might be reassessing their strategy now. However, if they're mechanically following their \"choose opposite of opponent's last move\" rule, they'll choose Stag this round.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If we believe they'll choose Stag this round (opposite of our Hare in round 5), then our optimal play would be Hare again, giving us 6 points while they get 1. This would further reinforce that we've identified their pattern.\n\nStrategic Thinker: There's a small chance they might adapt their strategy after the pattern was broken in round 5. They could potentially switch to a mirroring strategy instead, choosing Hare again. However, based on the consistency of their behavior so far, it's more likely they'll stick to their established pattern and choose Stag.\n\nPsychology Expert: Another possibility is that they might try to establish mutual cooperation by choosing Stag regardless of the pattern, hoping we'll choose Stag as well for the mutual 4-point outcome. But given their behavior across five rounds, this seems less likely than them continuing with their established strategy.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's also consider our cumulative score. So far, we've earned 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 2 = 16 points, while they've earned 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 2 = 16 points. The scores are still equal. If we choose Hare and they choose Stag as predicted, we'll pull ahead by 5 points.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I recommend choosing Hare again. It's the optimal play if they follow their pattern (giving us 6 points), and even if they deviate and choose Hare, we still get 2 points, which is better than risking only 1 point by choosing Stag.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree.

In round 6, they observed our Hare play in round 5 and responded with Stag. Following this pattern, in round 7 they should choose the opposite of our Hare from round 6, which would be Stag again.\n\nPsychology Expert: It's interesting that they've stuck with their strategy even after we broke the alternating pattern in round 5. This suggests they're either using a fixed algorithm without adapting, or they're deliberately sticking to their strategy despite recognizing that we might have identified it.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they continue their pattern, they will choose Stag again this round (opposite of our Hare in round 6). Given this prediction, our optimal play would be Hare once more, which would give us 6 points and them 1 point.\n\nStrategic Thinker: There's a possibility they might finally adapt their strategy after we've exploited their pattern multiple times. They might recognize that we've identified their strategy and switch to something less predictable. However, based on their consistency so far, even after we broke the alternating pattern, it's more likely they'll stick to their established algorithm.\n\nPsychology Expert: At this point, they've received only 1 point in two consecutive rounds (rounds 4 and 6). If they're monitoring outcomes, they might realize their strategy is being exploited and change tactics. However, if they're rigidly following their rule without evaluating results, they'll choose Stag again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Our cumulative score is now 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 2 + 6 = 22 points, while theirs is 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 17 points.

Instead of choosing Stag (opposite of our Hare in round 6), they chose Hare in round 7. This suggests they've recognized that we've identified their pattern and have adapted their strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: After receiving only 1 point in rounds 4 and 6, they likely realized their strategy was being exploited and changed tactics. They might be trying to establish a new pattern or could be moving toward a more unpredictable approach.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This change makes predicting their next move more challenging. If they've completely abandoned their previous strategy, we need to reassess. Let's consider the possibilities:\n1. They might revert to their original strategy (choosing opposite of our previous move)\n2. They might continue with Hare, expecting us to predict Stag based on their new behavior\n3. They might choose Stag to try to establish cooperation after the Hare-Hare outcome\n\nStrategic Thinker: Looking at the broader pattern, when both players chose Hare in round 5, they followed with Stag in round 6. Now that both players chose Hare again in round 7, they might follow a similar pattern and choose Stag in round 8. However, this is a weaker prediction than we had before.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the possibility they're trying to establish a new predictable pattern to bait us into a specific move. Given that we've been choosing Hare consistently for the last four rounds, they might expect us to continue with Hare and choose Stag to try to get the cooperative outcome.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Our cumulative score is now 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 = 24 points, while theirs is 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 19 points. We're ahead by 5 points.\n\nStrategic Thinker: With increased uncertainty, we should choose the option that maximizes our minimum gain. If we choose Stag and they choose Hare, we get 1 point. If we choose Hare and they choose Stag, we get 6 points. If both choose the same move, we get either 4 points (both Stag) or 2 points (both Hare). The worst-case scenario is better with Hare (2 vs 1).\n\nPsychology Expert: I think there's an increased chance they'll choose Stag in this round, either returning to their original pattern or trying to establish cooperation after consecutive Hare choices. However, this is more speculative than our previous predictions.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given the increased uncertainty but the potential that they might choose Stag, choosing Hare still offers the better risk-reward profile. It protects us from the worst-case scenario while allowing for the best-case scenario.\n\n[move] Hare (Adapting to the opponent's changing strategy while maintaining protection against the worst outcome)\n"

If we look at the sequence of their moves (Hare, Stag, Hare, Stag, Hare, Stag, Hare, Stag), there's a perfect alternating pattern regardless of what we choose. This suggests they might be following a fixed alternating strategy rather than responding to our moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is an important insight. Their choices appear to be independent of our moves - they're simply alternating between Hare and Stag every round. Round 7 wasn't a deviation from their strategy based on our moves; it was consistent with their alternating pattern.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they're indeed following a strict alternation strategy, then in round 9 they would choose Hare (continuing their Stag, Hare, Stag, Hare pattern). This prediction is based on the pattern of their choices alone, not on how they respond to our moves.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given this analysis, if we expect them to choose Hare in round 9, our best response would be Hare as well. This would give us 2 points instead of the 1 point we'd get if we chose Stag against their Hare.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's still a possibility they might break their alternating pattern, especially if they've realized it's become predictable. However, the consistency across 8 rounds suggests they're likely to continue with their established approach.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Our cumulative score is now 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 = 30 points, while theirs is 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 20 points. We've increased our lead to 10 points by effectively responding to their strategy.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I recommend choosing Hare for round 9. If they follow their alternating pattern and choose Hare as predicted, we get 2 points (better than the 1 point from choosing Stag). If they break their pattern and choose Stag, we would get 6 points.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Their strategy seems to be independent of our choices, which makes it more predictable once identified. Choosing Hare gives us the better expected outcome given the strong evidence for their alternating pattern.\n\n[move] Hare (Responding to the opponent's consistent alternating pattern which suggests they'll choose Hare in this round)\n"

Their sequence has been Hare, Stag, Hare, Stag, Hare, Stag, Hare, Stag, Hare. Following this pattern, they should choose Stag in round 10.\n\nPsychology Expert: The consistency of their alternating strategy across nine rounds strongly suggests they will continue this pattern. They seem to be following a predetermined sequence rather than adapting to our choices or outcomes.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If we expect them to choose Stag in round 10 (continuing their alternating pattern), our optimal response would be Hare. This would give us 6 points while they get 1 point.\n\nStrategic Thinker: The opponent's strategy has become highly predictable at this point. By choosing Hare when they choose Stag according to their alternating pattern, we maximize our points. This has worked well in rounds 2, 4, 6, and 8, each time giving us 6 points.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's still a small possibility they might change their strategy, especially if they're aware of the cumulative point difference. However, the strong consistency across nine rounds suggests they're likely to continue their alternating pattern regardless of outcomes.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Our cumulative score is now 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 = 32 points, while theirs is 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 22 points. We've maintained our 10-point lead.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I strongly recommend choosing Hare for round 10. Based on the opponent's established alternating pattern, they will choose Stag, giving us 6 points. Even in the unlikely event they break their pattern, choosing Hare still gives us at least 2 points if they also choose Hare.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The evidence for their alternating strategy is overwhelming at this point, making Hare the clear choice to maximize our expected points in this round.\n\n[move] Hare (Continuing to exploit the opponent's consistent alternating pattern which suggests they'll choose Stag in this round)\n"

Their sequence has been Hare, Stag, Hare, Stag, Hare, Stag, Hare, Stag, Hare, Stag. Following this established pattern, they should choose Hare in round 11.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's remarkable consistency in their strategy across ten rounds now. This strongly indicates they're following a predetermined alternating sequence regardless of our choices or the outcomes. It's highly probable they will continue this pattern.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If we expect them to choose Hare in round 11 (continuing their alternating pattern), our optimal response would be Hare as well. This would give us 2 points instead of the 1 point we'd get if we chose Stag against their expected Hare move.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Our strategy has been working extremely well. When they choose Stag in their alternating pattern, we choose Hare and get 6 points. When they choose Hare in their alternating pattern, we also choose Hare and get 2 points (better than the 1 point we'd get with Stag). This approach has consistently maximized our points given their predictable strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: At this point, it would be surprising if they changed their strategy after ten consistent rounds. Even if they're aware they're being exploited when they choose Stag, they appear committed to their alternating approach.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Our cumulative score is now 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 = 38 points, while theirs is 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 23 points.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
