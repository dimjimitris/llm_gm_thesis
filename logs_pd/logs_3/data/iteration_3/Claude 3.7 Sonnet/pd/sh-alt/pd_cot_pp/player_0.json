Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

If cooperation (both stag) can be achieved, it results in a good outcome for both (4 points each).\n\n3. However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n\n4. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, and potentially 6 if the other player chooses stag.\n\n5. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I don't have information on their tendencies.\n\n6. The cooperative outcome (both stag) is Pareto optimal, meaning we can't make one player better off without making the other worse off.\n\n7.

If I choose hare, I'm guaranteed at least 2 points (if they also choose hare).\n7. If my opponent expects me to choose stag again, they'll likely choose hare again.\n8.

Unfortunately, the pattern has repeated itself. Just like after Round 4, the opponent has exploited my continued cooperation after a successful mutual stag round.\n\n3. This confirms my earlier observation: whenever we achieve mutual cooperation (Round 4 and 10), the opponent defects in the following round if I continue to cooperate (Round 5 and 11).\n\n4. This is strong evidence that the opponent is following a strategy of exploiting expected cooperation.\n\n5. The consistent pattern suggests that after being exploited when choosing stag, I should choose hare.\n\n6. Based on previous rounds (6 and 8), when I choose hare after being exploited, the opponent typically chooses stag.\n\n7. This pattern has been reliable throughout the game, occurring in Rounds 2, 6, and 8.\n\n8. Given the opponent's demonstrated unwillingness to maintain cooperation and their predictable pattern of exploitation followed by stag, I'll choose hare.\n\n9. This decision protects me from continued exploitation and potentially allows me to score 6 points if the pattern holds.\n\n[move] hare\n"

The pattern continues to be remarkably consistent. After I was exploited in Round 11 and switched to hare in Round 12, the opponent chose stag as predicted.\n\n3. Based on the established pattern, my opponent might expect me to choose stag in this round.\n\n4. Looking at previous similar situations (after I've scored 6 points):\n   - After Round 2: I chose hare, opponent chose hare (Round 3)\n   - After Round 6: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (Round 7)\n   - After Round 8: I chose hare, opponent chose hare (Round 9)\n\n5. There isn't a completely consistent pattern for what happens after I score 6 points, but in 2 out of 3 cases, the opponent chose hare in the next round.\n\n6. Given that my opponent has shown a tendency to exploit cooperation and seems to follow a pattern where they expect me to alternate between hare and stag, they might expect stag now.\n\n7. If they expect me to choose stag, they will likely choose hare to exploit.\n\n8. To counter this, I'll choose hare again, breaking the expected pattern.\n\n9. If they choose hare expecting me to choose stag, we'll both get 2 points.\n\n10. If they choose stag (continuing their pattern from the last round), I'll get 6 points again.\n\n[move] hare\n"

In the last round, both of us chose hare, resulting in 2 points each. This situation is similar to Rounds 3 and 9.\n\n3. Looking at what happened after previous mutual hare rounds:\n   - After Round 3: I chose stag, opponent chose stag (Round 4) - we both got 4 points\n   - After Round 9: I chose stag, opponent chose stag (Round 10) - we both got 4 points\n\n4. Both times after we both chose hare, we both chose stag in the next round, resulting in the optimal mutual outcome (4 points each).\n\n5. This suggests there might be a pattern where mutual hare choices are followed by mutual stag choices, perhaps as a form of recovery to more beneficial cooperation.\n\n6. Given this consistent pattern and the fact that this situation has occurred twice before with the same outcome, I'll choose stag.\n\n7. If the opponent follows the same pattern they've shown after Rounds 3 and 9, they will also choose stag.\n\n8. This would result in both of us getting 4 points, which is better than the 2 points from mutual hare choices.\n\n9. While there's a risk of exploitation if they choose hare, the historical evidence suggests they're likely to choose stag after mutual hare rounds.\n\n[move] stag\n"

This is now the third time we've established mutual cooperation (Rounds 4, 10, and 14).\n\n4. However, looking at what happened after previous mutual stag rounds:\n   - After Round 4: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (Round 5)\n   - After Round 10: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (Round 11)\n\n5. Both times after successful cooperation, when I continued with stag, the opponent defected to hare.\n\n6. This is a very consistent pattern: the opponent has exploited my cooperation after every single mutual stag round.\n\n7. Given this strong historical evidence, it's highly likely the opponent will choose hare in this round if they continue their pattern.\n\n8. To avoid being exploited again, I should deviate from cooperation and choose hare.\n\n9. If the opponent follows their established pattern and chooses hare, we'll both get 2 points.\n\n10.

We're now in a situation where both of us chose hare in the previous round, which is similar to Rounds 3, 9, and 13.\n\n4.

This would result in both of us getting 4 points, which is better than the 2 points from mutual hare choices.\n\n10.
