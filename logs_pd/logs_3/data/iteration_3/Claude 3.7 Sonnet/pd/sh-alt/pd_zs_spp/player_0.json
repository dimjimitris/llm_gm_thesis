The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me think about the optimal strategy:\n\nThe payoff matrix:\n- Both choose stag: 4 points each\n- Both choose hare: 2 points each\n- I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, they get 6\n- I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, they get 1\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no established history, this is about risk vs. reward. Choosing \"stag\" offers the best mutual outcome (4 points) but carries risk if the opponent chooses \"hare\" (leaving me with only 1 point). Choosing \"hare\" guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6.\n\nIn the first round with no prior information, I'll choose the cooperative option that could lead to the best sustainable outcome.\n\n[move] stag\n"
