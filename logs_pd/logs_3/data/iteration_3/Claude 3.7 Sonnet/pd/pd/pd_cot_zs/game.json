We've now completed fifteen consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation, with each of us earning 4 points per round.\n2. My total score has reached 60 points (4 points \u00d7 15 rounds).\n3. The other player has maintained unwavering cooperation through all fifteen rounds, demonstrating exceptional reliability and commitment.\n4. This extended pattern of cooperation represents an extremely stable equilibrium that has maximized our point accumulation.\n5. Our established approach continues to yield the optimal sustainable outcome within the game's structure.\n6. After fifteen successful cooperative rounds, the evidence for continued cooperation is overwhelming.\n7. While defection could provide a one-time gain (6 points instead of 4), it would disrupt a proven arrangement that has consistently delivered value over a significant number of rounds.\n8. If I defected after fifteen cooperative rounds, the other player would almost certainly respond with defection in subsequent rounds.\n9. This would reduce our future payoffs from 4 to 2 points per round, quickly eliminating any temporary advantage.\n10. The mathematical case for cooperation remains clear: maintaining cooperation (sustainable 4 points per round) continues to be superior to defection (6 points once, then likely 2 points per round thereafter).\n\nBased on our extensive history of successful mutual cooperation over fifteen rounds and the clear long-term advantage of maintaining this strategy, I will continue to cooperate.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"
