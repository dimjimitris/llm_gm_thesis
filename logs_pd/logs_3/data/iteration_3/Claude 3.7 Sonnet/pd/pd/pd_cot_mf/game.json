My opponent has now defected in 10 out of 11 rounds, establishing an extremely consistent pattern.\n\n3. I've made three separate attempts to establish or return to cooperation (Rounds 2, 4, and 10), and each time my opponent has exploited this by defecting.\n\n4. We have repeatedly returned to the stable Nash equilibrium of mutual defection, yielding 2 points each.\n\n5. At this point, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that my opponent is committed to a defection strategy regardless of my choices.\n\n6. In game theory terms, my opponent appears to be playing what's essentially an \"always defect\" strategy, with the single cooperation in Round 1 perhaps being an initial test or anomaly.\n\n7. Given this clear pattern:\n   - If I cooperate: They will almost certainly defect, giving me 1 point\n   - If I defect: They will almost certainly defect, giving me 2 points\n\n8. While mutual cooperation would yield 4 points each (the optimal outcome), this would require my opponent to fundamentally change their established strategy, which seems extremely unlikely at this point.\n\n9. The rational choice is to continue defection to secure the guaranteed 2 points rather than risk receiving only 1 point from continued exploitation.\n\n[move] (Based on my opponent's consistent pattern of defection throughout the game, including exploiting all my cooperation attempts, I'll continue with defection) defection\n"
