Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both cooperate: We each get 4 points\n   - Both defect: We each get 2 points\n   - I cooperate, they defect: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I defect, they cooperate: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. This is similar to the classic Prisoner's Dilemma. The collectively optimal outcome is mutual cooperation (4 points each).\n\n3. However, there's always individual temptation to defect since:\n   - If they cooperate, I get more by defecting (6 > 4)\n   - If they defect, I get more by defecting (2 > 1)\n\n4. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I don't have past behavior to guide me.\n\n5. Starting with cooperation signals willingness to achieve mutual benefit and may establish a cooperative relationship.\n\n6. If the other player responds with cooperation too, we can both maximize our collective points.\n\n7. Even though defection might seem optimal for a single round, cooperation often leads to better outcomes in repeated interactions.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose cooperation as my opening move to establish a potentially beneficial relationship.\n\n[move] cooperation"

The pattern continues to be extraordinarily consistent - my opponent has defected in all seven rounds.\n\n3. I've already tested cooperation twice in non-consecutive rounds (1 and 4), and both times they exploited this choice, confirming they're likely following a pure defection strategy.\n\n4. While mutual defection (2 points each) is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (4 points each), I cannot unilaterally improve the outcome.\n\n5. At this point, I have extremely high confidence that my opponent will defect again.\n\n6. Given this:\n   - If I cooperate: I'll get 1 point, they'll get 6 points\n   - If I defect: I'll get 2 points, they'll get 2 points\n\n7. Defection remains my optimal strategy against an opponent who consistently defects.\n\n8. Without any sign of strategic adaptation from my opponent after seven rounds, continuing to test cooperation would only result in unnecessary point loss.\n\nFinal decision: I will defect again to secure 2 points, as this continues to be the rational choice against an opponent who consistently defects.\n\n[move] defection",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
