After eleven rounds of consistent defection, the probability of my opponent suddenly cooperating is essentially zero.\n7. While mutual cooperation would yield higher points (4 each), achieving this outcome appears impossible with this opponent.\n8. Game theory principles clearly indicate that against a pure defector, the optimal response is to defect.\n9. Any deviation from defection at this point would be irrational and would likely result in exploitation.\n10. Even if there is a very small possibility that this could be a final round where my opponent might change strategy, the expected value calculation still heavily favors defection.\n11. The Nash equilibrium of mutual defection continues to be the only rational choice given all available information.\n\n[move] (Continuing defection against an opponent with eleven consecutive rounds of defection) defection\n"
