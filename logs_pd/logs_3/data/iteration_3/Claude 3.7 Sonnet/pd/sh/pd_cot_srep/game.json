What's the optimal strategy here?\n   - Stag has the highest mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - But stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare while I choose stag, I only get 1 point\n   - Hare is safer - I'll get at least 2 points, and possibly 4 points\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies. \n\n4.

Total points so far: I have 1+4+2=7 points\n\n5. The highest mutual benefit would come from both choosing stag (6 points each).\n\n6. My opponent has shown willingness to choose stag in round 2. This could indicate:\n   - They might be willing to cooperate again\n   - They might be using a more complex strategy\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag \u2192 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare \u2192 1 point (worst outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag \u2192 4 points (good for me, bad for them)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare \u2192 2 points (mediocre for both)\n\n8.

Strategic considerations:\n   - We've now experienced successful cooperation with stag-stag\n   - This might signal a willingness to continue cooperation\n   - However, the opponent's historical pattern suggests they might return to hare in round 11\n\n5. If the every-4-rounds stag pattern holds true:\n   - Round 11 would be a hare round for my opponent\n   - Round 14 would be their next stag round\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose stag and they continue cooperation \u2192 6 points\n   - If I choose stag and they return to hare \u2192 1 point\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag \u2192 4 points\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare \u2192 2 points\n\n7. Given the pattern observed so far and the fact that this would be round 11, I expect my opponent to return to hare.\n\n8. While I'd like to maintain cooperation, the historical pattern strongly suggests they'll play hare in this round. Therefore, I'll choose hare to avoid getting only 1 point.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Pattern revision:\n   - My opponent has now chosen stag in rounds 2, 6, 10, and 11\n   - They've chosen stag in two consecutive rounds (10 and 11)\n   - This breaks their previous pattern of stag every 4 rounds\n   - It could indicate they're trying to establish consistent cooperation after our successful stag-stag round\n\n3. My total points: 1+4+2+1+2+4+2+2+2+6+4=30 points\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - My opponent has chosen stag twice in a row, possibly signaling a desire for cooperation\n   - They may continue with stag, hoping I'll reciprocate for mutual benefit\n   - They may be disappointed that I chose hare after our successful cooperation in round 10\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag (increasingly likely based on recent rounds) \u2192 6 points\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare (possibly as retaliation) \u2192 1 point\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag (as in rounds 10-11) \u2192 4 points\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare \u2192 2 points\n\n6. Given their consecutive stag moves, there's stronger evidence they're trying to establish cooperation. \n\n7. I'll choose stag for this round to signal my willingness to cooperate. This could lead to the optimal mutual outcome of 6 points each if they continue with stag.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent's behavior is more complex than I initially thought\n   - They chose stag in rounds 2, 6, 10, and 11, then returned to hare in round 12\n   - My attempt to establish cooperation was not successful\n\n3. My total points: 1+4+2+1+2+4+2+2+2+6+4+1=31 points\n\n4. Outcomes analysis:\n   - When I chose stag (4 rounds): I averaged 2.25 points per round\n   - When I chose hare (8 rounds): I averaged 2.75 points per round\n   - Hare has been consistently more profitable for me\n\n5. The pattern has become unpredictable, but one constant remains: choosing stag is risky and has often resulted in my lowest payoff.\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag \u2192 6 points (has happened once)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare \u2192 1 point (has happened 3 times)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag \u2192 4 points (has happened 3 times)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare \u2192 2 points (has happened 5 times)\n\n7. Given the historical performance and the unpredictable nature of my opponent, the safer strategy is to return to hare.\n\n8. I'll choose hare for this round, as it has statistically given me better outcomes overall and protects me from getting the minimum payoff.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has chosen stag in rounds 2, 6, 10, 11, and 13\n   - There's no clear numerical pattern to their stag choices anymore\n   - Their recent choices show stag in round 11, hare in round 12, then stag again in round 13\n   - This could indicate they're attempting an alternating pattern\n\n3. My total points: 1+4+2+1+2+4+2+2+2+6+4+1+4=35 points\n\n4. If the opponent is trying to alternate between stag and hare:\n   - Since they just played stag in round 13\n   - They would likely play hare in this round (14)\n\n5. Historical outcomes:\n   - When I chose stag (4 rounds): I averaged 2.25 points per round\n   - When I chose hare (9 rounds): I averaged 2.89 points per round\n   - Hare continues to be more profitable on average\n\n6. Risk assessment for this round:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag \u2192 6 points\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare (likely if alternating) \u2192 1 point\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag \u2192 4 points\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare (likely if alternating) \u2192 2 points\n\n7. Given the potential alternating pattern and that hare is statistically safer for me:\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points\n   - If they do choose hare as the alternating pattern suggests, we both get 2 points\n   - This is better than risking only 1 point if I choose stag and they choose hare\n\n8. I'll choose hare for this round based on the potential alternating pattern and historical success with this strategy.\n\n[move] hare\n"

Important pattern observation:\n   - My opponent has now chosen stag in 3 consecutive rounds (rounds 11, 13, 14)\n   - They've chosen stag in 6 out of 14 rounds overall\n   - They seem to have shifted strategy to predominantly choosing stag in recent rounds\n\n3. My total points: 1+4+2+1+2+4+2+2+2+6+4+1+4+4=39 points\n\n4. Recent trend analysis:\n   - In the last 5 rounds, my opponent chose stag 4 times\n   - This marks a significant departure from their earlier strategy\n   - They appear to be strongly signaling a desire for cooperation\n\n5. Statistical outcomes:\n   - When I chose stag (4 rounds): I averaged 2.25 points per round\n   - When I chose hare (10 rounds): I averaged 3.0 points per round\n   - Choosing hare when they choose stag has been very profitable for me (4 points each time)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - If my opponent is now consistently choosing stag, continuing with hare yields 4 points\n   - Switching to stag could yield 6 points if they continue with stag\n   - However, if they predict I might switch to stag and they switch to hare, I'd only get 1 point\n\n7. Strategic consideration:\n   - While continuing with hare is profitable, if my opponent keeps choosing stag, they're getting only 1 point repeatedly\n   - This might cause them to change strategy out of frustration\n   - Mutual cooperation (stag-stag) would be more sustainable long-term\n\n8. I'll switch to stag for this round to see if we can establish mutual cooperation, which would be optimal for both players.

Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag (highly likely based on recent history) \u2192 6 points\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare (less likely given their recent consistency) \u2192 1 point\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag (likely based on recent history) \u2192 4 points\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare \u2192 2 points\n\n6. Given the established cooperation and my opponent's consistent stag play, the best strategy is to continue cooperation by choosing stag.\n\n7. This builds trust and maximizes points for both players. Since my opponent has shown commitment to stag over multiple rounds, I should reciprocate.\n\n8. I'll choose stag to maintain our mutually beneficial cooperation.\n\n[move] stag\n"
