Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Choosing stag has higher potential reward (6 points) but also higher risk (only 1 point if the other player defects).\n\n5. In the first round with no prior information, I will choose cooperative play to establish potential for mutual benefit. If the other player also aims for the optimal collective outcome, we can both get the maximum points.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag to aim for the optimal cooperative outcome.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Our cumulative score has reached 78 points (6 points \u00d7 13 rounds), continuing our perfect optimization throughout the game.\n\n3. This consistent pattern over thirteen rounds represents an extraordinarily stable cooperative equilibrium that has been maintained without any deviation.\n\n4. The payoff structure remains unchanged:\n   - Mutual stag: 6 points each (optimal)\n   - Mutual hare: 2 points each (suboptimal)\n   - Mixed choices: 4/1 split (inefficient)\n\n5. After thirteen rounds of consistent cooperation, the evidence that the other player is fully committed to the stag strategy is definitive.\n\n6. In extended repeated games like this one, such unwavering consistency indicates both players have fully converged on the optimal strategy and are committed to it.\n\n7. Game theory suggests that after this many consistent rounds, the established pattern becomes self-reinforcing as both players recognize its mutual benefit.\n\n8. There continues to be no strategic advantage to deviating from our successful cooperative pattern, as it has consistently yielded the maximum possible points.\n\n9. The probability of the other player suddenly changing strategy after thirteen consistent rounds is virtually zero.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the established optimal cooperative strategy.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Our cumulative score has reached 84 points (6 points \u00d7 14 rounds), maintaining perfect optimization throughout this extended game.\n\n3. This unwavering pattern of cooperation over fourteen rounds represents an exceptionally robust strategic equilibrium that has been consistent without exception.\n\n4. The payoff structure continues to favor mutual stag hunting (6 points each) over all other possible combinations.\n\n5. With fourteen rounds of proven cooperation without a single deviation, we have established one of the strongest possible cooperative relationships in repeated game scenarios.\n\n6. In game theory terms, this represents a textbook example of a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium that persists over extended repetitions.\n\n7. The probability that the other player would suddenly deviate after fourteen consistent rounds is effectively zero based on our extensive history.\n\n8. There remains no strategic advantage to changing our successful approach, as the established pattern yields the maximum possible benefit for both players.\n\n9. Even if the game were approaching a conclusion (which hasn't been indicated), maintaining the cooperative strategy would still be rational based on the established pattern.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the established optimal cooperative strategy.\n\n[move] stag\n"
