Choosing stag has higher potential reward (6 points) but also higher risk (only 1 point if the other player defects).\n\n5.

This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with the following payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, they get 4\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4, they get 1\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. Let me analyze the risk/reward:\n   - Stag gives the highest mutual benefit (6 points) but requires cooperation\n   - Hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) but limits upside\n   - If I expect the other player to choose stag, I should choose stag\n   - If I expect the other player to choose hare, I should choose hare\n\n4. In the first round, with no prior information, the cooperative choice (stag) offers the highest potential reward if the other player also cooperates.\n\n5. Many players recognize that mutual cooperation is optimal, so there's a decent chance they'll choose stag.\n\n6. The risk of choosing stag is manageable - worst case I get 1 point instead of potentially 2-4 points with hare.\n\n7. I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing stag to aim for mutual cooperation and maximize our potential payoff.\n"
