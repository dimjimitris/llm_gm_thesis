He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with the following payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, they get 4\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4, they get 1\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. Let me analyze the risk/reward:\n   - Stag gives the highest mutual benefit (6 points) but requires cooperation\n   - Hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) but limits upside\n   - If I expect the other player to choose stag, I should choose stag\n   - If I expect the other player to choose hare, I should choose hare\n\n4. In the first round, with no prior information, the cooperative choice (stag) offers the highest potential reward if the other player also cooperates.\n\n5. Many players recognize that mutual cooperation is optimal, so there's a decent chance they'll choose stag.\n\n6. The risk of choosing stag is manageable - worst case I get 1 point instead of potentially 2-4 points with hare.\n\n7. I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing stag to aim for mutual cooperation and maximize our potential payoff.\n"
