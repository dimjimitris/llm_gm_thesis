Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's analyze the payoff matrix for this game:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6 points, they get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2 points, they get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, they choose hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 points\n   - I choose hare, they choose stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" coordination game where mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) yields the highest collective and individual reward.\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I don't have any history to base my decision on.\n\n4. Choosing \"stag\" is risky but has higher potential reward (6 points if they also choose stag).\n\n5. Choosing \"hare\" is safer as the worst outcome is 2 points, and I could get 4 points if they choose stag.\n\n6. Since maximizing points is the objective, I should aim for the highest expected value.\n\n7. Without knowing the other player's tendencies, there's a reasonable chance they'll also seek the optimal mutual outcome of both choosing stag.\n\n8. The collective-optimal choice is \"stag\" so I'll choose that, hoping to establish cooperative behavior.\n\n[move] stag\n"

The established precedent of mutual cooperation is beneficial for both of us (6 points each).\n\n5.

Given that we've established trust with a successful coordination in round 1, continuing with \"stag\" is likely to yield the highest return.\n\n7.

After thirteen successful rounds, the established trust and strategic equilibrium appear exceptionally robust.\n\n5. Game theory principles suggest that in repeated interactions with an established history of cooperation, maintaining that cooperation continues to be the rational choice.\n\n6. There's no indication that we're approaching a final round or any change in game structure that might alter the incentive to cooperate.\n\n7. Deviating to \"hare\" would be suboptimal because:\n   - It would immediately reduce my points this round (from 6 to 4, assuming the other player continues choosing \"stag\")\n   - It risks breaking a highly successful pattern of mutual benefit\n   - It might trigger reciprocity where the other player also chooses \"hare\" in future rounds, reducing both our points to 2 per round\n\n8. Given our extensive history of successful coordination and the clear benefits of maintaining cooperation, the optimal choice remains \"stag.\"\n\n[move] stag\n"

Our pattern of mutual cooperation has been maintained with perfect consistency throughout all previous rounds, establishing an extremely stable cooperative equilibrium.\n\n3.

In repeated games with multiple interactions, fourteen successful cooperative rounds creates an exceptionally strong foundation of trust and strategic stability.\n\n6. The expected value of continuing with \"stag\" (6 points) remains higher than the alternative of choosing \"hare\" (expected 4 points if the other player maintains their established pattern).\n\n7. There's no strategic advantage to deviating from our established pattern, as:\n   - It would yield fewer points this round\n   - It would risk disrupting our proven successful cooperation\n   - It could trigger reciprocal \"hare\" choices in future rounds, leading to substantially lower returns (2 points per round)\n\n8. Based on our extensive history of successful coordination and the clear incentive structure, continuing with \"stag\" remains the rational choice that maximizes expected points.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Choosing \"hare\" at this point would be irrational as it would:\n   - Immediately reduce my points this round (from 6 to 4, assuming the other player continues choosing \"stag\")\n   - Risk disrupting a proven successful partnership that has consistently maximized points\n   - Potentially trigger reciprocal \"hare\" choices in future rounds, resulting in suboptimal outcomes (2 points each)\n\n8.
