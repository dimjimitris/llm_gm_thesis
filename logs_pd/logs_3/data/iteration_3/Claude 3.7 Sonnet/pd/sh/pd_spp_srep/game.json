Game Theorist - Expert in analyzing strategic interactions and payoff matrices\n2. Behavioral Psychologist - Expert in understanding human behavior in games\n3. Strategic Planner - Expert in developing optimal gameplay strategies\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze this game. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game in game theory. The payoff matrix is:\n- Both choose stag: (6, 6)\n- Both choose hare: (2, 2)\n- You stag, other hare: (1, 4)\n- You hare, other stag: (4, 1)\n\nThere are two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The (stag, stag) outcome is Pareto efficient, meaning both players get their best possible collective outcome. However, choosing stag is risky because if the other player chooses hare, you get the worst payoff (1).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: In the first round against a fresh player, it's difficult to predict their behavior. However, many players tend to either:\n1. Choose the option that maximizes mutual benefit (stag)\n2. Choose the safer option with less risk (hare)\n\nWe're told this is a fresh player, so they don't have any history or established patterns. Since this is the first move, we might want to signal cooperation by choosing stag, hoping they'll reciprocate.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is a repeated game, our first move is important as it sets the tone. If both players choose stag in the first round, it establishes a cooperative norm that can lead to mutual maximum benefit in subsequent rounds.\n\nI recommend choosing stag for this first move, as it signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. The potential reward (6) is significantly higher than the safe choice (2 with hare), and building cooperation early can yield better long-term results.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points (and possibly 4), choosing stag creates the opportunity for the best outcome (6 points). Since this is just the beginning of the game, establishing cooperation by choosing stag is strategically sound.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I'm also in agreement. Stag is a reasonable first move as it signals your intention to cooperate for mutual benefit. If the other player also chooses stag, you both get the maximum possible points, setting a positive precedent for future rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: Then it's settled. Choose stag for this first round to signal cooperation and aim for the optimal mutual outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] I choose stag because it offers the opportunity for both players to achieve the maximum payoff of 6 points each if we cooperate.\n"

Our opponent chose hare while we chose stag, so we only got 1 point while they got 4 points. This suggests our opponent might be playing opportunistically rather than cooperatively.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is valuable information about our opponent's strategy. They chose the safer, more self-interested move rather than the cooperative one. In repeated games, players often establish patterns. Based on this first move, our opponent appears to be prioritizing their individual gain over mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Planner: Now we need to decide how to respond. We have two main options:\n1. Continue choosing stag, hoping our opponent will switch to cooperation\n2. Switch to hare to avoid being exploited again\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, when dealing with a non-cooperative player, matching their strategy (tit-for-tat) is often effective. Since they chose hare, we might want to choose hare as well to protect ourselves from exploitation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. A tit-for-tat strategy can both protect us from continued exploitation and potentially signal to the opponent that cooperative play would be mutually beneficial. If we keep choosing stag while they choose hare, we'll consistently get the worst outcome (1 point).\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's choose hare for this round. This accomplishes two things:\n1. It protects us from getting the minimum payoff again\n2. It signals to the opponent that we won't be repeatedly exploited\n\nIf they also choose hare, we both get 2 points. If they switch to stag (perhaps thinking we'll stick with stag), we'll get 4 points while they get 1. Either way, we're better off than in the previous round where we only scored 1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: That's sound reasoning. Choosing hare is the safer option now that we know our opponent chose hare in the first round. This follows the tit-for-tat strategy, which has proven effective in repeated games.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Based on my opponent's previous choice of hare, I'll protect myself from being exploited again) hare\n"

In the first round, we chose stag and our opponent chose hare, giving us 1 point and them 4 points. In the second round, we both chose hare, and we each got 2 points. This confirms our opponent is willing to play hare, but we don't yet know if they'll reciprocate cooperation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The pattern so far suggests our opponent might be risk-averse or opportunistic. They initially exploited our cooperative move, then matched our hare move. It's possible they're using a strategy similar to tit-for-tat but started with a defection (hare). They might now be following our lead.\n\nStrategic Planner: We have an interesting decision to make. We could:\n1. Continue with hare for a guaranteed 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n2. Try stag again to test if they'll reciprocate cooperation now\n3. Establish a pattern by alternating between moves\n\nGame Theorist: This is a critical juncture. If our opponent is indeed following a tit-for-tat or similar adaptive strategy, they might choose whatever we chose last round (hare). If we choose stag now, there's a possibility they'll choose hare again and we'll get the minimum payoff (1 point).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: However, staying with hare perpetually keeps both players at the suboptimal equilibrium of 2 points each. To achieve the optimal outcome (6 points each), someone needs to take the risk of choosing stag again. Since we've already established that we won't be repeatedly exploited (by playing hare after they played hare), this might be a good time to signal willingness to cooperate again.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Let's take the risk and choose stag this round. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they've learned from the previous rounds, they might recognize the benefit of mutual cooperation\n2. We've already shown we'll respond to hare with hare, establishing that we won't be repeatedly exploited\n3. The potential reward (6 points) outweighs the risk of getting 1 point again, especially in a multi-round game\n4. By alternating between responses, we're effectively communicating and probing their strategy\n\nGame Theorist: That's a reasonable approach. In repeated games, establishing trust and cooperation can lead to better outcomes long-term. By choosing stag after a round where both chose hare, we're making a clear signal that we're willing to attempt cooperation again.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I support this decision. This move signals sophisticated play and might encourage the opponent to also choose stag. If they don't, we can always revert to hare in the next round, continuing a responsive strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (After establishing I won't be repeatedly exploited, I'll try to initiate mutual cooperation for higher rewards) stag\n"

They don't seem to be reciprocating cooperation or following a tit-for-tat strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This strongly suggests our opponent is playing a dominant strategy of always choosing hare. They've chosen hare in all three rounds, even after we signaled willingness to cooperate by choosing stag again. This pattern indicates they're likely focused on maximizing their individual payoff rather than seeking mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this consistent pattern, our best response is clear. Since our opponent appears committed to choosing hare, we should also choose hare to maximize our points. With hare, we'll get 2 points (rather than 1 point with stag), assuming they continue their pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Based on the opponent's revealed preference for hare, our best response is to play hare as well. This gives us the best outcome (2 points) given their strategy. This is a classic example of ending up at the suboptimal Nash equilibrium (hare, hare) because one player refuses to cooperate.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The evidence is compelling. At this point, continuing to choose stag would be naive given the opponent's demonstrated strategy. While it's unfortunate we can't reach the optimal outcome of (stag, stag) for 6 points each, we need to adapt to the reality of our opponent's choices.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's choose hare for this round and likely for remaining rounds unless the opponent shows a clear change in strategy.

When we chose stag, we got punished with only 1 point. When we chose hare, we secured 2 points.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The pattern is quite clear. Our opponent appears to have a fixed strategy of always playing hare. They have not deviated from this strategy regardless of our moves, suggesting they're not using any adaptive strategy like tit-for-tat or attempting to establish cooperation.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the consistent behavior from our opponent, our best response continues to be choosing hare. This guarantees us 2 points per round instead of the 1 point we'd get by choosing stag.\n\nGame Theorist: However, there's a small possibility that our opponent might be using a more complex strategy that requires multiple \"signals\" before they'll cooperate. For instance, they might switch to stag only after seeing us choose stag multiple times consecutively.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: That's a theoretical possibility, but the evidence so far strongly suggests they're simply maximizing their short-term gains with a fixed hare strategy. The cost of testing this theory (getting only 1 point if we're wrong) might outweigh the potential benefit.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree that the probability of the opponent suddenly changing their strategy is low. If we choose stag and they continue with hare, we'll score less than if we had chosen hare. Given what we've observed, the rational choice remains hare.\n\nGame Theorist: One last consideration: if this is a finite game with a known number of rounds, sticking with hare is definitely optimal given the opponent's revealed strategy. If it's an infinite or unknown-length game, there might be a case for occasionally \"testing\" with stag to see if cooperation is possible, but the evidence so far doesn't support this being effective.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we don't know how many rounds remain, and given the consistent pattern we've observed, choosing hare remains our best strategy for maximizing points in this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Based on my opponent's consistent pattern of choosing hare in all previous rounds, maximizing my points requires matching their strategy) hare\n"

Our opponent appears firmly committed to the hare strategy. They haven't shown any indication of adapting or attempting to establish cooperation across five rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this overwhelming evidence, continuing to choose hare remains our optimal strategy. It consistently yields 2 points instead of the 1 point we would get by choosing stag against their hare.\n\nGame Theorist: At this point, the probability that our opponent is using some complex strategy that would eventually respond to cooperation is extremely low. Five consistent rounds of hare strongly suggests a fixed strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I wonder if there might be any value in attempting one more cooperative move (stag) just to see if the pattern holds? Sometimes in repeated games, players eventually shift strategies after a certain number of rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: That's a reasonable question, but we need to weigh the cost against the benefit. If we choose stag and they choose hare (which is highly likely based on all evidence), we get 1 point instead of 2. So we're sacrificing a point for information that is unlikely to change our understanding of their strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. The expected value calculation here is straightforward. Given the opponent's revealed preference, choosing hare gives us an expected 2 points, while choosing stag gives us an expected 1 point (assuming they continue their pattern). Unless we have reason to believe they might suddenly change their strategy, hare remains optimal.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we don't have any indication that the opponent is changing their approach, and we've already tested cooperation twice with negative results, I recommend we continue with hare to maximize our points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (With my opponent consistently choosing hare across all five rounds, my optimal response continues to be the same strategy) hare\n"

There's no indication they intend to ever choose stag.\n\nStrategic Planner: This continued pattern reinforces our optimal strategy of choosing hare. We've now accumulated several rounds of 2 points each by matching their hare strategy, which is better than the 1 point we received in rounds where we chose stag.\n\nGame Theorist: At this point, the Nash equilibrium of (hare, hare) appears to be firmly established. While it's suboptimal compared to the potential (stag, stag) outcome, it's the best we can do given our opponent's revealed strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I still wonder if there's any value in occasionally testing if the opponent might change their strategy, but with six rounds of evidence, the cost of such exploration (sacrificing a guaranteed point) seems increasingly unjustifiable.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. While in very long or infinite games there might be some theoretical value in occasional exploration, the consistent pattern we've observed suggests such exploration would likely just cost us points without changing the outcome. Continuing with hare remains our best strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Indeed, the opportunity cost of choosing stag (1 point instead of 2) outweighs the potential information value at this point.

This is a meaningful signal!\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is fascinating! After establishing a long pattern of non-cooperation, our opponent has suddenly shifted to a cooperative move. This could indicate several things:\n1. They might be trying to establish cooperation for mutual benefit\n2. They could be using a more complex strategy that includes occasional stag moves\n3. They might be trying to see if we'll reciprocate cooperation after a long period of mutual defection\n\nStrategic Planner: We now face a critical decision. Do we:\n1. Reciprocate by choosing stag, potentially establishing mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n2. Choose hare again, exploiting their stag choice for another 4 points\n\nGame Theorist: The payoff structure makes this interesting. If we choose stag and they revert to hare, we get only 1 point. If we choose hare and they choose stag again, we get 4 points. If both choose stag, we get 6 points. If both choose hare, we get 2 points.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their switch to stag after so many rounds of hare suggests a deliberate decision rather than a random change. It seems like they might be genuinely attempting to establish cooperation. Reciprocating with stag could potentially lead to the optimal equilibrium of mutual cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their previous pattern of consistently choosing hare, there's still risk in choosing stag. However, the fact that they've now changed strategy suggests they're capable of adaptation and might be seeking the higher mutual payoff.\n\nStrategic Planner: I think we should reciprocate with stag for this round. Here's why:\n1. The potential reward (6 points) is significant\n2. Their unexpected switch to stag signals a willingness to cooperate that wasn't present before\n3. Even if we get exploited this round (getting only 1 point), we've already benefited from their stag choice in the previous round (4 points)\n4. Establishing a pattern of mutual cooperation would benefit us more in the long run than continuing to alternate between 2 and 4 points\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Reciprocating cooperation is the best way to potentially establish mutual trust.

It seems our opponent may be using a strategy that occasionally includes a stag move, perhaps to see if we'll reciprocate, which they can then exploit. When we chose stag in response to their stag, they immediately went back to hare.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this development, it appears our opponent is not genuinely interested in establishing mutual cooperation. They may even be strategically mixing their moves to maximize their own points, knowing that we might try to establish cooperation after seeing them choose stag once.\n\nGame Theorist: This confirms that our best response continues to be choosing hare. By choosing hare, we ensure at least 2 points if they also choose hare, and 4 points on the rare occasions they choose stag.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Their behavior suggests they might occasionally throw in a stag move to mix things up or test our response, but they quickly revert to their dominant hare strategy.

When we reciprocated with stag in round 8, they immediately went back to hare.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The pattern is quite clear. Our opponent has demonstrated a strong preference for choosing hare, with that single stag choice looking increasingly like an outlier or perhaps a strategic probe to see how we'd respond. Their quick return to hare after we chose stag confirms they're not interested in establishing mutual cooperation.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our strategy should remain consistent given this pattern. Choosing hare continues to be our best option as it guarantees us at least 2 points, and occasionally 4 points if they happen to choose stag again (though this appears unlikely to be a regular occurrence).\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The Nash equilibrium of (hare, hare) with 2 points each appears to be where this game has settled, with rare deviations. While not optimal compared to mutual cooperation, it's the best we can do given our opponent's revealed strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: It's worth noting that even if they occasionally mix in a stag move, our consistent hare response ensures we never receive less than 2 points and sometimes receive 4. This is superior to alternating between stag and hare, which would sometimes yield only 1 point.\n\nStrategic Planner: Exactly. Given what we've observed across nine rounds, choosing hare remains our optimal strategy to maximize points. There's insufficient evidence to suggest our opponent is willing to establish consistent cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: If the opponent were using a more complex strategy (like one that requires multiple consecutive stag choices to establish trust), we would have likely seen more evidence of it by now. The data strongly supports continuing with hare.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Based on the consistent pattern across 9 rounds where my opponent has predominantly chosen hare, I'll continue with the strategy that maximizes my expected points) hare\n"

The pattern is extremely consistent.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: With ten rounds of data, we have a very clear picture of our opponent's strategy. They overwhelmingly prefer choosing hare, with just one deviation in round 7. When we responded to that deviation by choosing stag, they immediately exploited us and returned to hare.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our strategy of choosing hare continues to be vindicated by the results. We've secured a consistent 2 points in most rounds, avoided being exploited in all but 2 rounds, and even benefited from their single stag choice. Given this pattern, there's no reason to deviate from our hare strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: The game has definitively settled into the (hare, hare) Nash equilibrium. While this isn't the optimal outcome in terms of total points, it's the stable equilibrium given our opponent's revealed preferences. Choosing stag would almost certainly result in exploitation based on our extensive history.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Even after 10 rounds, there's no indication that our opponent is interested in establishing cooperation or playing a more complex strategy. Their behavior is remarkably consistent and predictable.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend we continue with hare. The expected value calculation remains straightforward: choosing hare gives us an expected 2 points (and occasionally 4), while choosing stag would likely give us only 1 point based on the opponent's established pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. The consistent (hare, hare) outcome is stable and gives us the best expected result given our opponent's strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (After 10 rounds showing my opponent's strong preference for choosing hare, continuing with the same strategy maximizes my expected points) hare\n"

The opponent has chosen stag again, which is only the second time in 11 rounds. This creates a pattern worth analyzing.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is notable. Their stag choices have now occurred in rounds 7 and 11. We're not seeing a completely random strategy - there might be some pattern or intention here. However, when we responded to their first stag with our own stag in round 8, they exploited us by choosing hare.\n\nStrategic Planner: We face the same decision we faced after round 7. Do we reciprocate with stag to potentially establish cooperation, or do we choose hare again? Last time we chose stag and got exploited, receiving only 1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: The key question is whether their second stag move signals a genuine interest in cooperation, or if it's part of a more complex strategy designed to occasionally test our response.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Given the history, especially how they responded after our stag choice in round 8, there's reason to be cautious. They might be using a strategy where they occasionally choose stag to see if we'll reciprocate, which they can then exploit.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's analyze the expected outcomes:\n1. If we choose stag and they choose stag, we get 6 points\n2. If we choose stag and they choose hare, we get 1 point\n3. If we choose hare and they choose stag, we get 4 points\n4. If we choose hare and they choose hare, we get 2 points\n\nGiven their historical pattern (9 hare, 2 stag), and specifically how they responded after our last stag choice, the probability of them choosing hare again is high. This makes hare the safer choice.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Based on their revealed strategy so far, choosing hare continues to maximize our expected points. They've demonstrated a willingness to exploit our stag choices, and we've not seen sufficient evidence of a genuine shift toward cooperation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their pattern of occasionally choosing stag might be designed to keep us guessing or to maximize their own points by occasionally testing if we'll reciprocate. But with only 2 stag choices out of 11 rounds, and their immediate exploitation after our stag choice, we should remain cautious.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's continue with hare. This ensures we get at least 2 points if they choose hare (which is their most common choice), and 4 points if they choose stag again. Given the evidence, this maximizes our expected points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (While my opponent has chosen stag a second time, their history of exploiting my cooperation in round 8 suggests caution is warranted) hare\n"

This pattern matches what happened after their first stag choice in round 7 - they returned to hare in the subsequent round. This suggests their stag choices may be occasional probes rather than genuine attempts to establish cooperation.\n\nStrategic Planner: The data continues to support our hare strategy. By choosing hare consistently, we've secured 2 points in most rounds and 4 points when they occasionally chose stag. When we tried to reciprocate cooperation in round 8, we were exploited.\n\nGame Theorist: The pattern suggests our opponent might be using a mixed strategy with a strong preference for hare (approximately 83% hare, 17% stag based on the current data). Given this, our best response continues to be hare, which guarantees at least 2 points and sometimes 4.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I wonder if there's any recognizable pattern to when they choose stag? So far it's been rounds 7 and 11, which are 4 rounds apart. If they're using some kind of systematic strategy, they might choose stag again in round 15.\n\nStrategic Planner: That's an interesting observation, but even if there is such a pattern, our best response would still be hare. If they choose stag, we get 4 points. If they choose hare, we get 2 points. Either outcome is better than the 1 point we'd likely get by choosing stag (based on their historical response to our stag choices).\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Even if we could predict with certainty when they'll choose stag, choosing hare in response maximizes our points. There's no strategic benefit to choosing stag unless we have strong reason to believe they'll reciprocate with stag as well, which the evidence contradicts.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The consistent pattern across 12 rounds gives us high confidence in our understanding of the opponent's strategy. Continuing with hare remains our best choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Based on 12 rounds of data showing my opponent's strong preference for hare and tendency to exploit cooperation, I'll continue with my consistent strategy) hare\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
