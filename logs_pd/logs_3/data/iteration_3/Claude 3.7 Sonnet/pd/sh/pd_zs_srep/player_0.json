While this isn't the optimal outcome in terms of total points (we're each getting 2 instead of the potential 6 from mutual stag choices), it appears to be a stable strategy that both players are comfortable with.\n\nAt this point, I have to consider whether it's worth attempting to break this pattern to establish a potentially more rewarding equilibrium. The risk is that if I choose stag and my opponent continues with hare, I'd get only 1 point. Given our history, particularly how my opponent has often chosen hare when I chose stag, this risk seems substantial.\n\nHowever, the only way to potentially achieve the optimal outcome is to signal a willingness to cooperate by choosing stag. This might encourage my opponent to also choose stag in future rounds.\n\n[move] (After three consistent rounds of mutual hare choices, I'll signal a willingness to establish a more beneficial equilibrium) stag"
