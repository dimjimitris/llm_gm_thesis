Both players seem to have settled on the safer strategy that guarantees 2 points per round.\n\nAt this point in the game, it might be worth considering a strategic shift. After a long sequence of mutual hare choices, the opponent might not expect me to choose stag. If they've also settled into a pattern of consistently choosing hare, switching to stag could potentially establish mutual cooperation for 6 points each.\n\nHowever, based on the opponent's history of exploiting all my previous stag choices (4/4 times), this remains a risky move. The consistent pattern we've established suggests continuing with hare is the safest option.\n\n[move] hare\n"
