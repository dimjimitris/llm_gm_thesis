Let me first analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (safer but lower reward)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 points (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 point (best for me individually)\n\n2. This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare)\n   - (stag, stag) is Pareto optimal - highest mutual benefit\n   - (hare, hare) is risk-dominant - safer option\n\n3. With a fresh player, there's no history to base my decision on. I need to consider:\n   - If they're rational and understand the game, they should prefer stag for maximum mutual points\n   - However, hare is the safer choice if I'm uncertain about their choice\n\n4. The stag choice has higher risk but higher reward. Since this is the first move with no established trust, both options are reasonable.\n\n5. I'll choose stag as it offers the potential for maximum points (6). While risky, it signals cooperative intent.\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing stag to aim for the optimal cooperative outcome.\n"

Risk assessment:\n   - If I maintain stag and they switch to hare, I would only get 1 point while they get 4\n   - However, such a switch would be irrational for them as they'd reduce their own points from 6 to 4\n   - The established cooperative pattern suggests continued cooperation is likely\n\n5. Since we successfully coordinated on the Pareto-optimal outcome in the previous round, and there's no reason to expect deviation, the most rational choice is to continue with stag.\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag to maintain the beneficial cooperation\n\n[move] stag - Continuing with stag to maintain our mutually beneficial cooperation established in the previous round.\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
