Evaluate the statistical evidence:\n   - Fifteen rounds of zero deviation provides maximum possible statistical confidence\n   - This level of consistency is statistically extraordinary and unprecedented\n   - Opponent demonstrates complete inability or unwillingness to vary strategy\n\n3. Calculate expected value:\n   - Hare vs their virtually guaranteed hare: 2 points (maximum statistical confidence)\n   - Hare vs their essentially zero chance of stag: 6 points (negligible probability)\n   - Stag vs their virtually guaranteed hare: 1 point (extremely poor expected outcome)\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - Fifteen consecutive rounds creates absolute behavioral predictability\n   - No evidence suggests opponent will ever deviate from pure defensive play\n   - Exploiting their complete predictability remains the only rational choice\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Continue optimal exploitation of absolutely predictable opponent behavior\n   - Fifteen rounds provides the strongest possible statistical justification\n\n[move] (Fifteen consecutive rounds of identical play establishes maximum possible confidence in opponent's unwavering defensive commitment) hare",

      "reasoning_text": "We've now played 15 consecutive rounds where both players chose hare every single time. This is an extraordinary level of consistency. At this point, the opponent has established the strongest possible behavioral pattern - 15 rounds of identical choices with zero deviation.\n\nFrom a game theory perspective:\n- The opponent has shown absolute commitment to defensive play\n- There's virtually no statistical probability they will deviate now\n- Continuing with hare against their expected hare gives me 2 points\n- If I switch to stag against their likely hare, I only get 1 point\n- The expected value heavily favors continuing with hare\n\n15 rounds of identical behavior is statistically overwhelming evidence of their strategy. There's no rational justification for deviating from exploiting this predictability.",
