Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: This is a coordination game where mutual cooperation (both stag) gives 4 points each, but there's a temptation to defect for potentially higher rewards.\n\n2. Consider my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 4 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 1 point (if opponent chooses hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 6 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 2 points (if opponent chooses hare)\n\n3. Evaluate opponent behavior: Since they're a \"fresh player,\" they may not yet understand the cooperative benefits and might play more randomly or cautiously.\n\n4. Risk assessment: Choosing hare guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point) and gives me a chance at the best outcome (6 points).\n\n5. Expected value: If the opponent chooses randomly, hare gives me a higher expected payoff (4 vs 2.5 points on average).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Against a fresh player who may not understand the cooperation dynamics yet, the safer strategy with higher expected value is hare.\n\n[move] hare"

Evaluate my options for round 2:\n   - If I choose stag and they stick with hare: I get 1 point (bad outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they stick with hare: I get 2 points (safe outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they switch to stag: I get 6 points (great outcome)\n\n4.

Consider if they might change strategy:\n   - They might try to cooperate (stag) to get the 4-point mutual benefit\n   - They might recognize that we're both stuck in a 2-point cycle\n   - Or they might continue the safe hare strategy\n\n4.

Probability evaluation:\n   - Chance they choose hare again: ~99.9999% based on this overwhelmingly strong pattern\n   - Chance they might try stag: ~0.0001% (virtually impossible after 13 consistent rounds)\n\n4.
