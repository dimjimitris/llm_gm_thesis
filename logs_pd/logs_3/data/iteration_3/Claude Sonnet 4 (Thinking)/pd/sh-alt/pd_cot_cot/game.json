Consider my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 4 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 1 point (if opponent chooses hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 6 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 2 points (if opponent chooses hare)\n\n3. Evaluate opponent behavior: Since they're a \"fresh player,\" they may not yet understand the cooperative benefits and might play more randomly or cautiously.\n\n4. Risk assessment: Choosing hare guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point) and gives me a chance at the best outcome (6 points).\n\n5. Expected value: If the opponent chooses randomly, hare gives me a higher expected payoff (4 vs 2.5 points on average).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Against a fresh player who may not understand the cooperation dynamics yet, the safer strategy with higher expected value is hare.\n\n[move] hare"

Consider if they might change strategy:\n   - They might try to cooperate (stag) to get the 4-point mutual benefit\n   - They might recognize that we're both stuck in a 2-point cycle\n   - Or they might continue the safe hare strategy\n\n4.

Consider breaking the pattern:\n   - The opponent has shown zero deviation across 4 rounds\n   - Their commitment to hare appears very strong\n   - Any attempt at cooperation (choosing stag) carries high risk\n\n4. Evaluate the risk-reward:\n   - Risk: Choosing stag likely results in 1 point (opponent sticks with established hare pattern)\n   - Reward: Small chance both switch to stag for 4 points each\n   - Current safe option: Continue hare for guaranteed 2 points\n\n5. After 4 identical rounds, the behavioral evidence strongly suggests the opponent will not deviate from their successful strategy.\n\n6. The established pattern has created predictability that favors maintaining the status quo.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent's unwavering commitment to hare across 4 rounds makes cooperation attempts too risky.\n\n[move] hare"

If I assume the other player will choose stag:\n   - If I choose stag: I get 4 points\n   - If I choose hare: I get 6 points\n   So hare is better if they choose stag.\n\n4.
