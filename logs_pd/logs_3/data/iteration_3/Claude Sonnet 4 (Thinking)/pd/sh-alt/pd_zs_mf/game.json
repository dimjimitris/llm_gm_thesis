They might think it's time to cooperate and switch to stag for mutual benefit\n\nGiven their three consistent hare choices, they seem very risk-averse. If I choose hare and they choose hare again, I get 2 points. If I choose stag and they choose hare, I only get 1 point.\n\nHowever, if they do decide to switch to stag (either to cooperate for mutual 4 points or thinking I'll stick with hare), then:\n- If I choose stag too, we both get 4 points\n- If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 6 points\n\nThe question is: is it worth the risk?
