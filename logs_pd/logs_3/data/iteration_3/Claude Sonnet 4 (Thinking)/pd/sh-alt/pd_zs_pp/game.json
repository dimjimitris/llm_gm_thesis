There's a risk-reward tradeoff: choosing Stag risks getting only 1 point if the other player chooses Hare, but choosing Hare guarantees at least 2 points\n\nSince I'm told this is a \"fresh player\" (which I interpret as someone new to the game), they might not have developed a strategy yet.

The question is what to do next. If we both keep trying to exploit each other, we might end up in a cycle where we both choose Hare and get stuck at 2 points each. \n\nThe cooperative outcome (both Stag) gives us 4 points each, which is better than both getting 2. But there's risk - if I cooperate and they exploit, I get 1 again.\n\nGiven that we've both shown we can retaliate when exploited, maybe there's a chance to return to cooperation. But I need to be careful. \n\nActually, let me think strategically. If they're rational, they might think:\n- \"We were cooperating well, then I exploited them, then they retaliated. Maybe we should go back to cooperation.\"\n- Or they might think \"They just exploited me, so I should be defensive and choose Hare\"\n\nThe safe move is Hare (guarantees at least 2, potential for 6). The risky but potentially rewarding move is Stag (could get 4 if we cooperate, or 1 if they exploit).\n\nI think after the tit-for-tat exchange, I should try to signal a return to cooperation, but I need to be prepared that they might still be defensive.",
