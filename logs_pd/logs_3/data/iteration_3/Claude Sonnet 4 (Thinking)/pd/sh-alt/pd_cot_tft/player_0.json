Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Fresh players are likely to either choose randomly or pick the safer option (hare) since it guarantees at least 2 points and offers the possibility of 6 points.\n\n4. If I choose stag and they choose hare (likely scenario), I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\n5. If I choose hare: I get either 2 points (if they also choose hare) or 6 points (if they choose stag) - both outcomes are better than the 1 point risk.\n\n6.

Review the incredibly consistent pattern:\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 6, they got 1\n   - Rounds 2-13: Both chose hare \u2192 We both got 2 each round\n\n2. Assess opponent's completely automated behavior: They've now chosen hare for 12 consecutive rounds. This behavior has moved beyond conscious strategy into pure habit/reflex after the initial traumatic experience.\n\n3. Consider their psychological state: After experiencing the worst outcome (1 point) early, they've validated their defensive strategy 12 times. From their perspective, this approach is completely vindicated.\n\n4. Evaluate any possibility of change: A fresh player who has repeated the identical choice 12 times consecutively has this response completely hardwired. The psychological barrier to change is insurmountable.\n\n5. Assess my strategic options:\n   - Stag: Essentially guaranteed 1-point outcome (opponent shows absolute consistency over 12 rounds)\n   - Hare: Guaranteed 2-point outcome (maintains our completely stable equilibrium)\n\n6. Reality check: After 12 rounds of identical opponent behavior, they've essentially become a deterministic system. Any deviation would be pure gambling with terrible odds.\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare to secure the predictable 2 points, as the opponent has demonstrated complete automation of their risk-avoidance response.\n\n[move] hare"
