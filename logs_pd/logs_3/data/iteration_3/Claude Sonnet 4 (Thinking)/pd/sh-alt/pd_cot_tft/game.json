The cooperative outcome (both choose stag) gives us both 4 points each - this is good for both players.\n\n2. If I choose hare while the other player chooses stag, I get the maximum possible reward of 6 points.\n\n3. If I choose stag while the other player chooses hare, I get the minimum reward of 1 point.\n\n4. If we both choose hare, we both get 2 points - this is a \"safe\" but suboptimal outcome.\n\nNow, what should I consider about my opponent? The hint says they are a \"fresh player\" - this could mean they're new to the game and might not understand the strategic implications.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Stag is the cooperative choice that requires trust\n- Hare is the safer choice that guarantees at least 2 points\n- A fresh player might not understand the benefits of cooperation\n- A fresh player might choose randomly or go with their gut instinct\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player, they might:\n1. Not understand the cooperative benefit of both choosing stag\n2. Be tempted by the high payoff (6 points) from choosing hare when I choose stag\n3. Choose hare as the \"safer\" option since it guarantees at least 2 points\n\nIf I assume the fresh player is likely to choose hare (either because they don't understand cooperation or because they want the safe option), then I should choose hare as well to get 2 points rather than risk getting only 1 point.\n \nI'll calculate the probabilities carefully. If the player chooses randomly, I have a 50% chance of getting 6 points by choosing hare when they select stag. The expected value calculation shows hare gives me 4 points on average, while stag only yields 2.5 points.\n\nFresh players might actually lean towards stag due to psychological factors like primacy effect and initial trust.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
