The opponent has shown zero deviation over 11 rounds, which is an extremely strong behavioral pattern. \n\nFrom a game theory perspective, I'm locked in a Nash equilibrium where both players choose hare. While (stag, stag) would give us both 4 points instead of 2, it requires coordination and trust. Given that my opponent has chosen hare 11 times consecutively, the probability they will switch to stag is essentially zero.\n\nIf I switch to stag and they continue with hare (which is almost certain), I get 1 point instead of 2. That would be a bad outcome for me.\n\nThe rational choice is clearly to continue with hare.",
