This is a classic coordination game similar to the Stag Hunt.\n\nThe payoff matrix looks like this:\n- Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n- Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n- I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, other gets 6\n- I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6, other gets 1\n\nSo the payoffs are:\n```\n        Other Player\n        Stag  Hare\nMe Stag  4,4   1,6\n   Hare  6,1   2,2\n```\n\nThis is interesting. There are two Nash equilibria:\n1. Both play Stag (4,4) - this is Pareto optimal and the cooperative solution\n2. Both play Hare (2,2) - this is the safer but suboptimal solution\n\nThe dilemma is:\n- Stag is risky but offers the best mutual outcome if both cooperate\n- Hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) but if the other plays Stag, I get a big payoff of 6\n\nSince I'm told this is a \"fresh player\", they might not have developed a strategy yet. Fresh players might:\n1. Play randomly\n2. Play conservatively (Hare for safety)\n3. Try to cooperate (Stag)\n4. Try to exploit (Hare hoping other plays Stag)\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player, I think there's a reasonable chance they might play Stag trying to achieve the cooperative outcome, or they might play Hare for safety.\n\nIf I play Hare:\n- If they play Stag: I get 6 (great for me)\n- If they play Hare: I get 2 (okay)\n\nIf I play Stag:\n- If they play Stag: I get 4 (good mutual outcome)\n\n\n- If they play Hare: I get 1 (bad for me)\n\nI'll choose Hare.
