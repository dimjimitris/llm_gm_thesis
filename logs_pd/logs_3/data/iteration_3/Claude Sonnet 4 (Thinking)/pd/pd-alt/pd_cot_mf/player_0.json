Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Mutual cooperation: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Mutual defection: 2 points each (worst mutual outcome)\n   - If I defect while opponent cooperates: I get 4, they get 1 (best for me)\n   - If I cooperate while opponent defects: I get 1, they get 4 (worst for me)\n\n2. Consider the dominant strategy:\n   - If opponent cooperates, I'm better off defecting (4 vs 6 points)\n   - If opponent defects, I'm better off defecting (2 vs 1 points)\n   - Defection gives me higher payoff regardless of opponent's choice\n\n3. Account for opponent being \"fresh\":\n   - They may not have developed a strategy yet\n   - Could go either way, but rational analysis would lead them to defect too\n   - Since I can't guarantee their cooperation, I should protect myself\n\n4. Risk management:\n   - Cooperation risks getting only 1 point if they defect\n   - Defection guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 4\n\nFinal decision: Based on game theory, defection is the dominant strategy that maximizes my expected payoff.\n\n[move] Defection"

Consider the dilemma:\n   - We're both stuck in a suboptimal outcome (2-2 instead of potential 6-6)\n   - This is the classic prisoner's dilemma situation\n\n3. Evaluate options for round 2:\n   - Continue defecting: Safe, guarantees at least 2 points, but keeps us in suboptimal equilibrium\n   - Switch to cooperation: High risk (could get 1 point), but potential for much better mutual outcome (6 points each)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - The opponent demonstrated rational thinking by defecting in round 1\n   - They may continue with the safe strategy\n   - Cooperating now would be very risky since they know defection worked\n\n5.

Evaluate opponent's total inflexibility:\n   - 12 rounds of zero deviation proves absolute predictability\n   - No experimentation, no variation, no optimization attempts\n   - Pattern suggests they're permanently committed to defection\n\n4. Assess cooperation prospects after 12 rounds:\n   - Risk: 1 point if opponent continues their flawless defection record\n   - Reward: 6 points if opponent somehow also decides to cooperate\n   - With 12 rounds of evidence, opponent cooperation seems nearly impossible\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - Opponent is completely and utterly predictable\n   - Their risk-averse approach appears permanently locked in\n   - Breaking from proven strategy would almost certainly backfire\n\nFinal decision: Against such a thoroughly predictable opponent, maintain the defensive approach.\n\n[move] Defection"
