Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Mutual cooperation gives us both 6 points (best combined outcome)\n   - Mutual defection gives us both 2 points (worst combined outcome)\n   - If one cooperates and other defects: cooperator gets 1, defector gets 4\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - They may not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might initially think about mutual benefit\n   - Or they might immediately see the advantage of defection\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - Cooperation risks getting only 1 point if they defect, but offers 6 points if they cooperate\n   - Defection guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 4 points\n\n4. Strategic consideration: Since this is our first interaction, establishing a cooperative pattern could be beneficial for future rounds if this continues.\n\n5. Decision: I'll take the cooperative approach to test if we can establish mutual benefit, while being prepared to adjust strategy based on their response.\n\n[move] cooperation"

Statistical confidence with large sample:\n   - 13/13 defections = 100% defection rate across extensive gameplay\n   - This pattern has proven absolutely consistent and reliable\n   - No deviation whatsoever observed across 13 rounds\n\n3. Expected value calculation:\n   - Cooperation: Virtually 0% chance of success, near-certain 1-point exploitation\n   - Defection: Guaranteed 2 points based on their unwavering behavior\n   - The mathematical advantage of defection is overwhelming\n\n4. Game theory equilibrium:\n   - Thirteen rounds confirms permanent mutual defection equilibrium\n   - Their absolute commitment to defection makes cooperation irrational\n   - I must maintain protection against certain exploitation\n\n5.

Risk-reward mathematical analysis:\n   - Cooperation: Near-zero probability of mutual cooperation, almost certain 1-point exploitation\n   - Defection: Guaranteed 2 points based on their proven unwavering pattern\n   - The expected value strongly favors defection\n\n4. Strategic equilibrium confirmation:\n   - Fourteen rounds definitively confirms permanent mutual defection equilibrium\n   - Their pure defection strategy makes cooperation economically irrational\n   - I must continue protecting myself from predictable exploitation\n\n5.
