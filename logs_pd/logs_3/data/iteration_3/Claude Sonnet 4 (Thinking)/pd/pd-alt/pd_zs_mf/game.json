Let me re-analyze:\n- If the other player cooperates and I cooperate: I get 6\n- If the other player cooperates and I defect: I get 4\n- If the other player defects and I cooperate: I get 1  \n- If the other player defects and I defect: I get 2\n\nSo if the other player cooperates, cooperation gives me 6 vs defection giving me 4. Cooperation is better.\nIf the other player defects, defection gives me 2 vs cooperation giving me 1. Defection is better.\n\nThis means there's no dominant strategy for me. My best move depends on what the other player does.\n\nSince this is described as playing against a \"fresh player\", I assume this means a new player who hasn't established any patterns yet. \n\n\nI'll consider the potential strategies of an unknown player.
