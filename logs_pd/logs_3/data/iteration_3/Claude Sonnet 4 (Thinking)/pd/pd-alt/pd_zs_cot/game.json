At some point, I might wonder if I should try to exploit this predictable cooperation to get 4 points instead of 6... but wait, that doesn't make sense. 6 > 4, so cooperation is still better for me.\n\n4. The key insight: In this prisoner's dilemma, if I can predict my opponent will cooperate (which seems very likely given 4 consecutive cooperative moves), then cooperation gives me 6 points while defection only gives me 4 points. So cooperation is actually the better choice even from a purely selfish perspective.\n\n5. The only reason to defect would be if I thought they might defect, in which case I'd want to avoid getting only 1 point. But given their consistent cooperation, this seems very unlikely.\n\nLet me continue with cooperation.",
