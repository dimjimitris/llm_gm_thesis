Consider the opponent - a fresh player:\n   - Fresh players often play cautiously to avoid worst-case scenarios\n   - They might choose hare to guarantee at least 2 points rather than risk getting only 1\n\n3. Evaluate my risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing stag: High reward (6) if they cooperate, but high risk (1) if they don't\n   - Choosing hare: Guaranteed minimum of 2 points, with potential for 4 if they choose stag\n\n4. Make strategic decision:\n   - Against an unknown fresh player, the safe play is hare\n   - This guarantees I won't get the worst outcome of 1 point\n   - If they choose stag, I get 4 points which is still good\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since I'm playing against a fresh player who might play it safe, I'll choose hare to minimize my risk while potentially capitalizing if they choose stag.\n\n[move] hare"
