Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Stag vs Stag: Both get 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - Hare vs Hare: Both get 2 points (safe mutual outcome)  \n   - Stag vs Hare: I get 1, other gets 4 (bad for me)\n   - Hare vs Stag: I get 4, other gets 1 (good for me, bad for them)\n\n2. Consider the other player's likely behavior:\n   - As a fresh player, they might not fully grasp the strategic implications\n   - They could play conservatively (Hare) to guarantee at least 2 points\n   - Or they might cooperate (Stag) hoping for the best mutual outcome\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - Stag: High risk (1 point) but high reward potential (6 points)\n   - Hare: Lower risk (2 points minimum) but also limits upside (4 points max)\n\n4. Strategic consideration:\n   - Since this is the first interaction, I want to signal cooperation\n   - The (Stag, Stag) outcome benefits both players maximally\n   - If we can establish mutual trust, we both win big\n\nSince the mutual cooperation outcome (6,6) is significantly better than the safe outcome (2,2), and I want to test if this fresh player will cooperate, I'll take the risk and signal cooperation.\n\n[move] Stag"

Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Continue cooperating (Stag): Maintains trust and potential for another 6 points\n   - Defect to Hare: Could get 4 points if they stick with Stag, but breaks trust\n   - If I defect and they also switch to Hare, we both only get 2 points\n\n4. Long-term thinking:\n   - Continued cooperation yields 6 points per round\n   - Breaking trust likely leads to mutual defection (2 points each)\n   - The cooperative equilibrium is clearly superior\n\nSince we successfully established cooperation and both benefited maximally, I should maintain this winning strategy.\n\n[move] Stag"
