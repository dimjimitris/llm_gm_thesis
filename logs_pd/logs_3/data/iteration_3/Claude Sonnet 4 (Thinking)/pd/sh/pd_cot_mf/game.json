Consider the risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing Stag: High risk (could get 1), high reward (could get 6)\n   - Choosing Hare: Lower risk (guaranteed at least 2), moderate reward (could get 4)\n\n3. Factor in that this is a fresh player:\n   - Uncertain what strategy they'll use\n   - They might play cautiously or randomly\n   - No prior behavior to predict from\n\n4. Evaluate expected outcomes:\n   - Hare guarantees at least 2 points and offers upside of 4\n   - Stag risks getting only 1 point, though offers maximum of 6\n\n5.

Identify the possible outcomes and their payoffs for me:\n   - If I choose Stag: I get either 6 (if they choose Stag) or 1 (if they choose Hare)\n   - If I choose Hare: I get either 4 (if they choose Stag) or 2 (if they choose Hare)\n\n2.

Analyze the risk vs reward:\n   - Stag is high-risk, high-reward: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point\n   - Hare is moderate-risk, moderate-reward: Best case 4 points, worst case 2 points\n\n4. Consider the Nash equilibria:\n   - (Stag, Stag) is a Nash equilibrium with payoff (6,6)\n   - (Hare, Hare) is also a Nash equilibrium with payoff (2,2)\n   - The (Stag, Stag) equilibrium is Pareto optimal (best for both players)\n   \nI'm weighing the potential outcomes carefully. A fresh player introduces unpredictability, making the decision complex. The cooperative Stag option offers the highest potential reward but carries significant risk. Hare provides a more conservative approach with a guaranteed minimum return. My intuition leans towards minimizing potential losses while keeping the possibility of a moderate gain open.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
