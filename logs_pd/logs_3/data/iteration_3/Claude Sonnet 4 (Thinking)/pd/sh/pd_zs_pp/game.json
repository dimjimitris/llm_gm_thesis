Continue with hare since it worked (safe strategy)\n2. Try stag thinking I might also try stag for the higher payoff\n3. Stick with their safe approach\n\nSince this is still a fresh player and they chose the safe option in round 1, they're likely to continue being cautious. However, there's also a possibility they might try to coordinate on stag for the higher payoff.\n\nThe question is: should I try to coordinate on stag (risky but high reward) or continue with the safe hare strategy?\n\nIf I choose stag and they choose hare again, I get only 1 point.\nIf I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4 points.\nIf we both choose stag, we both get 6 points.\nIf we both choose hare again, we both get 2 points.\n\nGiven that they played safe last round, I think they're more likely to stick with hare. So choosing hare myself would give me either 2 points (if they also choose hare) or 4 points (if they try stag). Choosing stag would give me either 6 points (if they also choose stag) or 1 point (if they stick with hare).\n\nI think the safer bet is still hare, since this player seems risk-averse.",
