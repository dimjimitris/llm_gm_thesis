This looks like a variant of the Stag Hunt game.\n\nThe payoff matrix is:\n- Both choose stag: Both get 6 points\n- Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n- I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, other gets 4\n- I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4, other gets 1\n\nSo the payoff matrix from my perspective is:\n```\n           Other Player\n           Stag  Hare\nMe  Stag    6     1\n    Hare    4     2\n```\n\nThis is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria:\n1. Both play stag (6,6) - this is the payoff-dominant equilibrium\n2. Both play hare (2,2) - this is the risk-dominant equilibrium\n\nThe dilemma is:\n- Stag gives the highest payoff (6) if we both choose it, but the lowest payoff (1) if I choose it and the other player doesn't\n- Hare is safer - it guarantees at least 2 points, and gives 4 if the other player chooses stag\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might be:\n1. Risk-averse and choose the safer hare option\n2. Optimistic and go for the high-reward stag option\n3. Random/unpredictable\n\nGiven that this is the first round and I want to maximize my expected payoff, I need to think about what a fresh player is likely to do. Fresh players often:\n- Choose safer options when uncertain\n- Might not fully understand the strategic implications\n- Could be influenced by the framing\n\nSince hare gives me either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare), while stag gives me either 6 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare), I think the safer play for a first round against an unknown opponent is hare.\n \nI'm betting on the possibility that an optimistic player might choose stag, which could lead to our mutual success.
