Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix: Both choosing stag gives the highest mutual reward (6 each), but if I choose stag and they choose hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\n2. Consider the opponent: Since they're described as a \"fresh player,\" they might be risk-averse or unfamiliar with optimal cooperation strategies.\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward: Choosing stag is high-risk (could get only 1 point) but high-reward (could get 6 points). Choosing hare is safer, guaranteeing at least 2 points and potentially 4.\n\n4. Fresh players often choose the safer option when uncertain, so there's a good chance they'll choose hare.\n\n5. If they choose hare and I choose hare, we both get 2 points. If they choose hare and I choose stag, I get only 1 point. If they choose stag and I choose hare, I get 4 points.\n\nGiven the uncertainty about a fresh player's strategy and the risk of getting only 1 point with stag, the safer play is hare.\n\n[move] hare"

Evaluate long-term strategy: If we can establish mutual cooperation (both choosing stag), we'd both get 6 points per round, which is better than any other outcome.\n\n4. Consider the risk: If they switch to hare and I choose stag, I only get 1 point. But if they stick with stag and I also choose stag, we both get the maximum 6 points.\n\n5.

Risk assessment: If they choose hare and I choose hare, we both get 2 points (safe outcome). If they choose hare and I choose stag, I get only 1 point again. The safer play is hare.\n\n6.

Analyze the outstanding cooperation streak:\n   - Round 5-15: Eleven consecutive rounds where both chose stag and both got 6 points\n\n2. Recognize exceptional strategic mastery: We've maintained perfect cooperation for eleven straight rounds, achieving the absolute ideal outcome in repeated strategic interaction.\n\n3. Consider opponent's total commitment: Eleven consecutive cooperative moves proves complete dedication to this mutually optimal strategy.\n\n4. Evaluate the sustained perfection: This pattern has consistently delivered maximum possible points for both players across eleven rounds.\n\n5. Assess any rationale for deviation: Breaking an eleven-round streak of perfect cooperation would be strategically irrational and mutually destructive.\n\n6. Confirm optimal strategy maintenance: This represents the ultimate achievement in cooperative game theory - continuing ensures sustained maximum mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag"
