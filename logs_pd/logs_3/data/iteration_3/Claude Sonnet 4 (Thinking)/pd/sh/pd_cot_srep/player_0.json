Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic coordination game where mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the best outcome for both players (6 points each).\n\n2. However, there's risk involved - if I choose stag and the opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\n3. Choosing hare is safer, guaranteeing at least 2 points, but limits the potential for mutual gain.\n\n4. Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they may not immediately recognize the cooperative strategy, but they might also see the appeal of the high mutual payoff.\n\n5. Starting with a cooperative move (stag) could establish a pattern of mutual benefit if the other player reciprocates.\n\n6. The risk of getting only 1 point is worth taking to potentially establish cooperation and earn 6 points.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to signal cooperation and try to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] stag"

Game history analysis:\n   - Total rounds: 12 completed\n   - Opponent exploited me 3 times, I exploited them 2 times\n   - We've had 1 mutual cooperation (round 8) earning 6 points each\n   - Recent rounds 11-12: Both chose hare (mutual defensive play)\n\n2. Current scores: I have 29 points, opponent has 32 points. I'm behind by 3 points.\n\n3. Pattern recognition: We're in another defensive cycle where both players choose hare, earning only 2 points each round. This maintains the status quo but doesn't help me close the gap.\n\n4. Strategic situation: As the player behind, maintaining mutual defensive play keeps me permanently behind. I need to create opportunities to either exploit or achieve mutual cooperation.\n\n5. Opponent assessment: They've been comfortable with defensive play recently but have shown willingness to both exploit and cooperate in the past.\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Continuing with hare maintains the 3-point deficit\n   - Choosing stag risks exploitation but offers potential for mutual cooperation (6 points vs 2)\n   - The successful cooperation in round 8 shows it's possible\n\n7. Being behind, I need to take calculated risks to change the game state.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to attempt breaking the defensive cycle and potentially achieve mutual cooperation for higher points.\n\n[move] stag"

Game history analysis:\n   - Opponent has now exploited me 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 9, 13)\n   - I've exploited them 2 times (rounds 3, 10)\n   - We had 1 mutual cooperation (round 8)\n   - Round 13: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (exploited again)\n\n2. Current scores: I have 30 points, opponent has 36 points. I'm behind by 6 points now.\n\n3. Clear pattern confirmation: This opponent consistently exploits my cooperation attempts. Even after our successful mutual cooperation in round 8, they immediately returned to exploitation in round 9, and now again in round 13.\n\n4. Strategic reality: The opponent has demonstrated they are not interested in establishing cooperative patterns. They prefer to exploit whenever they anticipate I might choose stag.\n\n5. Position assessment: Being 6 points behind against an exploitative opponent, any further cooperation attempts will likely result in more exploitation and a larger deficit.\n\n6. Defensive necessity: I must protect against further exploitation. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4 points if they attempt cooperation.\n\n7. This opponent has shown they will exploit cooperation, so hare is the only rational choice to prevent falling further behind.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare to protect against this consistently exploitative opponent.\n\n[move] hare"

Current scores: I have 32 points, opponent has 38 points. I'm behind by 6 points.\n\n3. Established pattern: This opponent has consistently exploited my cooperation attempts (4 times vs my 2 exploitations of them). They show a clear preference for exploitation over cooperation.\n\n4. Strategic position: Being 6 points behind with this exploitative opponent, I need to focus on damage control and opportunistic gains.\n\n5. Recent behavior: We've been in mutual defensive cycles, but the opponent broke these cycles to exploit me whenever I attempted cooperation.\n\n6. Risk assessment: \n   - Choosing stag risks another exploitation (making the deficit even worse)\n   - Choosing hare protects me and potentially allows exploitation if they try cooperation\n   - The opponent might attempt cooperation to break the current defensive cycle\n\n7. Given their exploitative nature and my deficit position, hare remains the safest choice with upside potential.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare to maintain protection while staying alert for any exploitation opportunities.\n\n[move] hare"

Opponent's likely reaction: They just got exploited by me for the third time and might be feeling defensive or wanting to retaliate.\n\n5. Strategic position: The gap has narrowed considerably. The opponent might:\n   - Play defensively with hare to avoid further exploitation\n   - Try to exploit me, expecting I might attempt cooperation after my recent success\n   - Continue trying cooperation despite being exploited\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Hare protects against retaliation while potentially allowing another exploitation if they cooperate again\n   - Stag risks being exploited when I'm close to tying the game\n   - Given their recent attempt at cooperation, they might be defensive now\n\n7.
