This is a classic coordination game where mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the best outcome for both players (6 points each).\n\n2. However, there's risk involved - if I choose stag and the opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\n3. Choosing hare is safer, guaranteeing at least 2 points, but limits the potential for mutual gain.\n\n4. Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they may not immediately recognize the cooperative strategy, but they might also see the appeal of the high mutual payoff.\n\n5. Starting with a cooperative move (stag) could establish a pattern of mutual benefit if the other player reciprocates.\n\n6. The risk of getting only 1 point is worth taking to potentially establish cooperation and earn 6 points.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to signal cooperation and try to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] stag"

Choosing hare is safer, guaranteeing at least 2 points, but limits the potential for mutual gain.\n\n4. Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they may not immediately recognize the cooperative strategy, but they might also see the appeal of the high mutual payoff.\n\n5. Starting with a cooperative move (stag) could establish a pattern of mutual benefit if the other player reciprocates.\n\n6.

However, there's a risk - if I choose stag and the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\n3. If I choose hare, I'm guaranteed at least 2 points (if they choose hare too) and could get 4 points if they choose stag.\n\n4.

Try stag - risky, but if they also choose stag, we both get 6 points and I start closing the gap\n\nGiven that we've been in a mutual hare cycle for several rounds, the opponent might be getting predictable. There's a chance they might try stag to break out of the low-payoff cycle, especially since the mutual cooperation (both stag) gives much better payoffs than the current pattern.\n \nI recognize the potential downside of my strategy. Choosing stag could backfire if the opponent decides to exploit my risk-taking. However, staying passive means I'll never overcome my current point deficit.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
