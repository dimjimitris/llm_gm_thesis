We've established a very strong cooperative relationship.\n\nHowever, I should think about whether there's any strategic reason to consider deviating at this point. Let me think:\n\n1. If I switch to hare while they continue with stag, I would get 4 points and they would get 1 point. This would break our cooperation and likely lead them to switch to hare in future rounds.\n\n2. If we both continue with stag, we both get 6 points - the maximum possible.\n\n3. There's a risk that after so many cooperative rounds, they might be thinking of deviating to get the 4 points while I get 1.\n\nBut given the incredibly consistent pattern over 12 rounds, it seems like we've both recognized the value of cooperation. There's no real reason to break this successful partnership. The opponent has shown complete reliability and trustworthiness over many rounds.\n\nI should continue with stag to maintain this successful cooperation.",

The pattern has been incredibly consistent.\n\nAt this point, I need to consider whether there's any strategic reason to change. The cooperation has been perfect and mutually beneficial. Both players are getting the maximum possible points consistently.\n\nFrom a game theory perspective, this is a stable equilibrium in the stag hunt game when both players are cooperating. There's no immediate incentive to deviate since:\n- If I switch to hare while they stay with stag, I get 4 points (less than the 6 I'm currently getting)\n- If we both switch to hare, we both get 2 points (much less than the 6 we're currently getting)\n\nThe only risk would be if the other player suddenly decides to switch to hare, in which case I'd get only 1 point if I stick with stag. But given the 13 rounds of consistent cooperation, there's no indication they're planning to change.\n\nThe rational choice remains stag for continued cooperation.",
