Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" I should consider their likely behavior:\n   - They may not understand the cooperative nature of the game\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" hare option to avoid risk\n   - They're less likely to trust that I'll cooperate with stag\n\n3. Risk analysis:\n   - Choosing stag: High risk (could get only 1 point), high reward (could get 6 points)\n   - Choosing hare: Lower risk (guaranteed at least 2 points), moderate reward (up to 4 points)\n\n4. Against a fresh player who likely doesn't understand optimal cooperation, hare is the safer choice that protects me from the worst outcome while still giving decent point potential.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to minimize risk against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] hare"

Predicting their next move:\n   - They might stick with hare since it worked safely last round\n   - As a fresh player, they may not yet see the value of risking stag for cooperation\n   - They could potentially try stag if they learned about mutual cooperation\n\n3. Analyzing my options for round 2:\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare again: 2 points each (safe)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points (very good for me)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (bad for me)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points each (best outcome)\n\n4.

Statistical significance:\n   - After 13 identical rounds, this is overwhelming statistical evidence of their strategy\n   - The other player has had numerous opportunities to experiment but consistently chose not to\n   - No indication whatsoever of strategic evolution or consideration of mutual cooperation\n\n3. Risk-reward calculation:\n   - Hare choice: guaranteed 2 points (based on 13-round pattern of evidence)\n   - Stag choice: ~1 point expected (extremely high probability they choose hare again)\n   - After 13 rounds, unilateral deviation remains highly counterproductive\n\n4.
