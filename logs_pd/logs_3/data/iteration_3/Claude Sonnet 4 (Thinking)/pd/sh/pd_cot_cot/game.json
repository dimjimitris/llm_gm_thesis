Risk analysis:\n   - Choosing stag: High risk (could get only 1 point), high reward (could get 6 points)\n   - Choosing hare: Lower risk (guaranteed at least 2 points), moderate reward (up to 4 points)\n\n4.

Assess opponent's likely strategy: With two consecutive hare choices, the opponent appears committed to a conservative approach and is unlikely to suddenly switch to the riskier stag option.\n\n3. Calculate expected outcomes:\n   - If I choose hare and opponent continues with hare (high probability): 2 points\n   - If I choose hare and opponent switches to stag (low probability): 4 points\n   - If I choose stag and opponent sticks with hare (high probability): 1 point\n   - If I choose stag and opponent switches to stag (low probability): 6 points\n\n4. Evaluate risk: Switching to stag has a high probability of yielding only 1 point based on the established pattern, while hare guarantees at least 2 points with upside potential.\n\n5. Consider that opponent might be thinking similarly about exploiting my pattern, but their consistent conservative play suggests they're unlikely to deviate.\n\nFinal decision: Stick with hare to maintain steady points while avoiding the high risk of getting only 1 point\n\n[move] (Opponent has been consistently conservative, so maintaining hare strategy maximizes expected value) hare"

If they think I'll choose hare again, they might switch to stag to get the 6 points from mutual cooperation\n5. But if they switch to stag and I stick with hare, I get 4 points and they get 1\n6. Alternatively, if I switch to stag and they stick with hare, I get 1 point and they get 4\n\nThis is getting into game theory territory. Let me think about this:\n- If I assume they'll stick with hare (conservative play), then I should choose stag to get 1 point vs their 4 points - that's bad for me\n- If I assume they'll switch to stag (trying to get the 6-6 outcome), then I should choose stag too to get 6 points\n- If I stick with hare and they switch to stag, I get 4 points which is better than the 2 we got last round\n\nThe key question is: will they stick with the safe hare strategy, or will they try to coordinate on stag for the higher payoff?\n\nGiven that we both played conservatively in round 1, there's a chance they might think I'll continue being conservative, so they might try stag. But there's also a chance they'll stick with the proven safe strategy.\n\nI think the optimal play here is to choose stag - if they also choose stag we both get 6 points (much better than 2), and if they choose hare I only get 1 point (worse than 2, but the upside potential is worth the risk).\n \nI'm reconsidering my strategy. The conservative play of hare seems more prudent. By choosing hare, I guarantee at least 2 points and potentially gain 4 if they switch to stag. The risk of getting only 1 point is too high if they choose stag while I choose stag.",
