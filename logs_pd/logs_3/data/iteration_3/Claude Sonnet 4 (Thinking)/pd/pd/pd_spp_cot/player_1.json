Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they may not have established patterns yet. However, rational analysis would lead them to the same conclusion about defection being dominant.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward: Cooperation has higher mutual benefit but carries the risk of being exploited. Defection guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point) and gives me the best individual outcome if opponent cooperates.\n\n5. Apply game theory: In a single-round prisoner's dilemma, the Nash equilibrium is mutual defection, which is the rational choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Defection maximizes my expected points.\n\n[move] Defection"

Interpret opponent behavior: They switched from defection to cooperation after mutual defection. This could indicate they're testing for reciprocity or trying to establish mutual cooperation.\n\n3.

Analyze complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1,3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12: Both defected (2-2 each) - 9 rounds of mutual defection\n   - Round 2: I defected, opponent cooperated (6-1 to me)\n   - Round 4: I cooperated, opponent defected (1-6 to them)\n   - Round 5: I defected, opponent cooperated (6-1 to me)\n\n2. Calculate current standings: My total is 31 points, opponent's is 26 points. I maintain a consistent 5-point lead.\n\n3. Observe deeply entrenched pattern: We've had seven consecutive rounds of mutual defection (rounds 6-12). This represents a stable Nash equilibrium where both players are defensive.\n\n4. Assess opponent's strategy commitment: They haven't attempted cooperation in 7 rounds since being exploited in round 5. They appear to have completely abandoned cooperative strategies.\n\n5. Evaluate my position: My 5-point lead has been stable throughout this extended mutual defection phase. This advantage was built from successfully exploiting their cooperation attempts early in the game.\n\n6. Consider long-term strategy: The opponent has shown no signs of breaking from defection, and any cooperation attempt from me would risk my established advantage.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection to maintain my winning lead in this stable equilibrium.\n\n[move] Defection"

Assess opponent's strategic commitment: They haven't attempted cooperation in 8 rounds since being exploited in round 5. They appear completely committed to defensive play.\n\n5. Evaluate strategic position: My 5-point advantage has remained constant throughout this extended mutual defection phase. This lead was established early through successful exploitation of their cooperation attempts.\n\n6. Consider equilibrium stability: Both players are now locked in a predictable pattern. Any deviation to cooperation would be extremely risky given the opponent's demonstrated willingness to exploit (round 4) and my successful defensive strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Maintain defection to preserve my established lead in this stable defensive equilibrium.\n\n[move] Defection"
