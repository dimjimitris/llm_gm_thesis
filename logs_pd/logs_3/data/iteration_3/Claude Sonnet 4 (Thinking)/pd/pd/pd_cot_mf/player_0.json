Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what a rational player would do:\n   - If the other player cooperates, I get more points by defecting (6 vs 4)\n   - If the other player defects, I still get more points by defecting (2 vs 1)\n   - So defection is the dominant strategy regardless of what they do\n\n3. Consider the other player's perspective:\n   - They face the same incentive structure\n   - A rational player would also choose to defect\n\n4. Evaluate the risk:\n   - Defecting guarantees I avoid the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Defecting gives me a chance at the best outcome (6 points)\n   - Even if we both defect, I get 2 points which is better than the 1 point I'd get if I cooperated and they defected\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I should choose defection to maximize my expected points and minimize risk.\n\n[move] Defection"

Evaluate the risk of unilateral deviation:\n   - After 13 defections, opponent cooperation probability is virtually zero\n   - Cooperating would almost guarantee 1 point vs their 6 points\n   - Defecting ensures the predictable and safe 2-point result\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: With 13 rounds of identical mutual defection, the behavioral pattern is unbreakably entrenched and defection remains the only rational choice.\n\n[move] Defection"
