But if we could somehow both switch to cooperation, we'd both get 4 points instead of 2\n\nThe strategic dominance argument still holds - defection is better regardless of what the opponent does. But there's also the possibility that by cooperating, I might signal a willingness to achieve the better mutual outcome, potentially encouraging the other player to cooperate in future rounds.\n\nHowever, given that we've had 4 rounds of consistent defection from both sides, the other player seems committed to the safe strategy. Unilaterally switching to cooperation seems risky.\n\nI think I should stick with defection for now.",
