Both players have been completely consistent, each earning 2 points per round.\n\nAt this point, I need to think about whether there's any reason to deviate from this pattern. The game theory suggests that in a repeated game, sometimes cooperation can emerge if both players are willing to take risks. However, after 10 rounds of mutual defection, the pattern is so established that any deviation would be extremely risky.\n\nThe opponent has shown no signs of wanting to cooperate - they've consistently chosen defection for 10 straight rounds. If I were to cooperate now, I would almost certainly get only 1 point while they get 6, which would be a terrible outcome for me.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium of mutual defection has been reached and maintained. While mutual cooperation would be better for both players (4 points each vs 2 points each), there's no indication that the opponent would reciprocate cooperation.\n\nI should continue with defection to maintain the stable, predictable outcome.",
