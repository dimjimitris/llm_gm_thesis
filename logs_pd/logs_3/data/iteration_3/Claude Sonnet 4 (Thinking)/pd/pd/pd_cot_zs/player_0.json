Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Mutual cooperation: 4 points each\n   - Mutual defection: 2 points each  \n   - If I cooperate and opponent defects: I get 1, they get 6\n   - If I defect and opponent cooperates: I get 6, they get 1\n\n2. From a strategic standpoint, defection dominates cooperation:\n   - If opponent cooperates, I get 6 (defect) vs 4 (cooperate)\n   - If opponent defects, I get 2 (defect) vs 1 (cooperate)\n\n3. Since this is a \"fresh player\" with no established pattern, I should assume they might make any move.\n\n4. To maximize my points regardless of their choice, defection is the optimal strategy.\n\n5. Even though mutual cooperation would give us both 4 points, I cannot guarantee the other player will cooperate, and the risk of getting only 1 point if they defect while I cooperate is too high.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose defection to maximize expected points.\n\n[move] Defection"

Pattern analysis from all rounds:\n   - Rounds 1-12: Both defected consistently \u2192 2 points each every round\n   - Twelve consecutive rounds of perfect mutual defection\n   - Opponent has shown remarkable strategic rigidity\n\n2. Strategic assessment:\n   - We're in an extremely entrenched mutual defection equilibrium\n   - Both players have missed 24 potential points over 12 rounds (2 per round)\n   - Opponent demonstrates complete unwillingness to deviate from safe strategy\n\n3. Opponent behavior evaluation:\n   - Twelve rounds with absolutely zero variation indicates extreme commitment\n   - No experimental moves, signals, or any indication toward cooperation\n   - Shows absolute preference for guaranteed 2 points over any potential risk\n\n4. Risk analysis for cooperation attempt:\n   - After 12 identical rounds, cooperation would be completely unprecedented\n   - Extremely high probability opponent continues their rock-solid pattern\n   - Risk of getting only 1 point while they get 6 is very substantial\n\n5. Expected outcome calculation:\n   - Defection: guaranteed 2 points (matches perfect 12-round established pattern)\n   - Cooperation: very likely 1 point, very unlikely 4 points\n   - Opponent's perfect 12-round consistency suggests virtually no probability of change\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue defection given opponent's absolute 12-round consistency.\n\n[move] Defection"
