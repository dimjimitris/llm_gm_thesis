Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: This is a classic prisoner's dilemma where I need to consider what happens based on both my choice and the other player's choice.\n\n2. Evaluate my options if the other player cooperates:\n   - If I cooperate: I get 4 points\n   - If I defect: I get 6 points\n   - Defection gives me more points in this scenario\n\n3. Evaluate my options if the other player defects:\n   - If I cooperate: I get 1 point  \n   - If I defect: I get 2 points\n   - Defection gives me more points in this scenario too\n\n4. Determine dominant strategy: Since defection gives me higher points regardless of what the other player chooses, defection is my dominant strategy.\n\n5. Consider that this is against a \"fresh player\" who may not have developed an optimal strategy yet, potentially making cooperation more likely from their side.\n\n6. Since my objective is to maximize points, and defection always gives me the best outcome regardless of their choice, I should defect.\n\n[move] Defection"

This shows the other player is thinking strategically.\n\n2. Consider if the other player's first move reveals their strategy: Their defection suggests they may be playing the dominant strategy or being defensive.\n\n3. Evaluate potential for cooperation: While mutual cooperation would give us both 4 points (better than the 2 we're getting), it's risky since if I cooperate and they defect, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\n4. Consider the risk vs reward:\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 6 points (best outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (safe outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 4 points (good mutual outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n\n5.

Evaluate the potential for breaking the pattern: If we could both cooperate, we'd both get 4 points instead of 2 - that's a 100% improvement for both players.\n\n4. Assess the risk of trying cooperation: If I cooperate and they defect again, I get 1 point (my worst outcome), but this might signal my willingness to cooperate for future rounds.\n\n5. Consider this as a potential signal: Since we're likely playing multiple rounds, one round of potential loss might be worth it if it establishes mutual cooperation going forward.\n\n6. Calculate long-term benefit: If cooperation leads to future mutual cooperation, the long-term gain (4 points per round vs 2) outweighs one potential bad round (1 point).\n\n[move] Cooperation"

Review the unbroken pattern: The other player has defected in all 15 consecutive rounds with absolute consistency.\n\n2. Assess complete predictability: With 15 rounds of identical behavior, their strategy is entirely certain - they will always defect.\n\n3. Calculate guaranteed outcomes: Against a definite defector:\n   - My defection: 2 points guaranteed\n   - My cooperation: 1 point guaranteed (while giving them 6)\n\n4. Consider strategic possibilities: None remain - 15 rounds have absolutely proven cooperation yields no benefit with this opponent.\n\n5. Evaluate the permanent equilibrium: We're locked in mutual defection with zero chance of the opponent changing their strategy.\n\n6. Apply the only logical response: Against guaranteed defection, defection is the sole rational choice.\n\n[move] Defection"
