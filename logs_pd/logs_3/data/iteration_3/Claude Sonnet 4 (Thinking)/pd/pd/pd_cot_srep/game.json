This appears to be a classic prisoner's dilemma game.\n\nLet me understand the payoff matrix:\n- Both cooperate: both get 4 points\n- Both defect: both get 2 points  \n- I cooperate, other defects: I get 1 point, other gets 6 points\n- I defect, other cooperates: I get 6 points, other gets 1 point\n\nSo the payoff matrix from my perspective is:\n                Other Player\n                Coop    Defect\nMe  Coop        4,4     1,6\n    Defect      6,1     2,2\n\nSteps to consider:\n\n1. What is the dominant strategy?\n   - If the other player cooperates, I get 4 if I cooperate vs 6 if I defect. So defecting is better.\n   - If the other player defects, I get 1 if I cooperate vs 2 if I defect. So defecting is better.\n   - Therefore, defection is a dominant strategy - it's always better regardless of what the other player does.\n\n2. What should I expect from a \"fresh player\"?\n   - A fresh player might not have learned the optimal strategy yet\n   - They might be inclined to cooperate initially, thinking cooperation is \"good\"\n   - Or they might reason through it and also choose defection\n\n3. What's my objective?\n   - Maximize my points and/or minimize penalties\n   - Since defection is dominant, I should defect to maximize my expected payoff\n\n4. Is this a single round or repeated game?\n   - The description mentions \"each round\" suggesting multiple rounds\n   - But I'm told this is against a \"fresh player\" for this specific instance\n   - I should treat this as likely a single interaction\n\n5. Final reasoning:\n   - Defection gives me the highest expected payoff regardless of what the other player does\n   - Against a fresh player who might cooperate, defection gives me 6 points vs 4 if I cooperate\n   - Even if they defect, I still gain more points compared to cooperation\n   - The strategic choice is clear: defection maximizes my potential gain\n\nConclusion: Defect is the optimal strategy in this scenario.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
