    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Behavioral Psychologist - Understanding player psychology and decision patterns\n3. Strategic Advisor - Help formulate optimal game strategies\n4. AI Assistant (me) - Coordinate discussions and make final decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix. This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario. While defection gives a higher individual payoff in a single round, mutual cooperation (4,4) is better than mutual defection (2,2) for both players.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first round with a fresh player, establishing a cooperative tone early can encourage reciprocal cooperation. Research shows that starting with cooperation often leads to better long-term outcomes in repeated games.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree. Starting with cooperation signals good faith and willingness to achieve mutual benefit. If the other player defects, we can adjust our strategy, but cooperation gives us the potential for optimal mutual outcome (4 points each).\n\nGame Theorist: While defection is the Nash equilibrium in a single-round game, if this might be repeated, cooperation could help establish a beneficial pattern.\n\nAI Assistant: The consensus seems to favor cooperation for the first move. This balances risk and reward while opening the possibility for mutual benefit.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Cooperate\nI choose to cooperate to signal willingness for mutual benefit and potentially establish a cooperative pattern.\n"

Continuing with cooperation would reinforce this positive dynamic.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Maintaining cooperation makes sense here. The other player has shown willingness to cooperate, and we've established a beneficial pattern. Switching to defection now could break trust and lead to mutual defection in future rounds, reducing our potential points.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed.

The other player maintains their sophisticated approach to maximizing long-term benefits.\n\nStrategic Advisor: At this advanced stage, with such a lengthy history of successful cooperation, maintaining our strategy is even more crucial. We've established a perfect pattern of maximum sustainable returns that would be foolish to disrupt.\n\nGame Theorist: The repeated demonstration of mutual cooperation continues to validate the fundamental game theory principle that sustained cooperation yields optimal outcomes in iterated games.\n\nAI Assistant: Our strategy's remarkable success makes the choice straightforward.\n\n[move] (Continuing our highly successful cooperative strategy that has consistently delivered optimal outcomes over fourteen rounds) cooperation\n"
