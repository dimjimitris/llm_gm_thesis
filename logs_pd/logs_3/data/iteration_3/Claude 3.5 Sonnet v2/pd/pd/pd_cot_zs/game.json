Initial game considerations:\n   - This is the first move\n   - No prior history with this player\n   - Need to balance risk and reward\n\n3. Strategy evaluation:\n   - Cooperation establishes goodwill and potential for mutual benefit\n   - Defection provides higher individual reward but risks retaliation\n   - In repeated games, initial cooperation often leads to better long-term outcomes\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Worst case if I cooperate: 1 point (if other player defects)\n   - Worst case if I defect: 2 points (if other player defects)\n   - Best case if I cooperate: 4 points (mutual cooperation)\n   - Best case if I defect: 6 points (if other player cooperates)\n\n5.
