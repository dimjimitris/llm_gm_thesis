    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Strategic Planner - For developing optimal strategies\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential outcomes and risks\n4. AI Assistant (me) - For making the final decision\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The payoff matrix shows that (stag, stag) is a Nash equilibrium with the highest mutual benefit (4,4). However, (hare, hare) is also a Nash equilibrium, though with lower payoffs (2,2). The risk comes when players choose differently, leading to (1,6) or (6,1).\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we're playing against a fresh player, we should consider the most rational and cooperative approach. The stag strategy offers the highest mutual benefit if both players cooperate. It's a risk-dominant strategy that could establish trust and lead to better long-term outcomes.\n\nRisk Analyst: While choosing stag has the potential for the highest mutual payoff (4), it also carries the risk of getting the lowest payoff (1) if the other player chooses hare. However, since this is the first move against a fresh player, there's no negative history to consider, and we could set a cooperative tone.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given this is the first move against a fresh player, I agree we should aim for mutual benefit and try to establish a cooperative relationship. The potential reward of mutual stag hunting (4 points) outweighs the safer but lower payoff of choosing hare.\n\nStrategic Planner: Yes, choosing stag signals our willingness to cooperate and could lead to a better outcome if the other player recognizes the mutual benefit. Even if we risk getting only 1 point this round, it sets a positive precedent for future interactions.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to hunt the stag, aiming for mutual cooperation and maximum benefit.\n"

Both players chose stag, achieving the optimal Nash equilibrium (4,4). This suggests our opponent understands the benefits of cooperation and is also playing strategically.\n\nStrategic Planner: The fact that our opponent chose stag in the first round is a very positive signal. They demonstrated willingness to cooperate and seek mutual benefit. Given this successful interaction, maintaining the same strategy would be logical to reinforce the cooperative behavior.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk of switching to hare now would be two-fold:\n1. We would get less points (2 if they also switch to hare, or 6 if they stay with stag but at the cost of breaking trust)\n2. We might break the established trust and push the opponent towards less cooperative behavior in future rounds\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree that maintaining our stag strategy is optimal here. We've established a cooperative dynamic, and there's no reason to deviate from it.\n\nStrategic Planner: Yes, consistency in this case reinforces trust and maintains the optimal outcome for both players. The previous round shows our opponent is rational and understands the benefits of cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: While there's always the risk of the opponent switching to hare, the demonstrated cooperative behavior in round 1 suggests they're likely to maintain their stag strategy as well.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Maintaining cooperative strategy given successful mutual cooperation in the previous round.\n"
