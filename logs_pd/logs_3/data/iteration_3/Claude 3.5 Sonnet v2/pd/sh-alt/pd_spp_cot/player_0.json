    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst: Specialist in evaluating risks and rewards\n3. Strategic Planner: Expert in developing game strategies\n4. AI Assistant (me): Coordinator and decision maker\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game, where cooperation (stag) yields the best mutual outcome, but also carries risk. The Nash equilibria are either both players choosing stag (payoff 4,4) or both choosing hare (payoff 2,2).\n\nRisk Analyst: Against a fresh player, we need to consider both the potential reward and risk. Choosing stag has higher potential payoff (4) if the other player cooperates, but also higher risk of getting only 1 point if they don't. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first interaction, we have no prior history to base our decision on. However, establishing cooperation early can be beneficial for long-term gains. Many players tend to start with cooperative moves in such games.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The stag strategy, while risky, has the potential to establish a cooperative pattern. The payoff matrix clearly shows that mutual cooperation (stag-stag) is the most efficient outcome for both players.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on the analysis, I believe choosing stag is the better option here. It signals willingness to cooperate and can lead to the optimal outcome. If the other player is rational, they should also see the benefit of mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate and hope to establish a mutually beneficial relationship with the other player.\n"

The other player has demonstrated willingness to cooperate, which significantly reduces the risk of choosing stag again. However, we should still be aware that they could switch strategies.\n\nStrategic Planner: The successful cooperation in round 1 establishes a positive precedent. Maintaining this cooperation would be beneficial for both players. Switching to hare now would likely destroy the trust built and could lead to a less optimal equilibrium.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the established cooperation and the demonstrated rationality of the other player, continuing with stag is the optimal strategy. It reinforces the cooperative equilibrium and maintains the highest mutual payoff.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with maintaining our cooperative strategy.
