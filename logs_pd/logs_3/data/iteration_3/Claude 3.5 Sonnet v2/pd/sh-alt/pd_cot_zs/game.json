Analyzing the payoff matrix:\n   * Stag + Stag = 4 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   * Hare + Hare = 2 points each (mediocre mutual outcome)\n   * Stag + Hare = 1 vs 6 points (worst for stag chooser)\n   * Hare + Stag = 6 vs 1 points (best individual outcome)\n\n3. Key considerations:\n   * Choosing stag has higher potential mutual benefit (4 points)\n   * But stag is risky - if other player chooses hare, I get minimum points (1)\n   * Hare is safer - guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 6\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   * With a fresh player, they might be inclined to cooperate initially\n   * Establishing mutual trust early could lead to better long-term outcomes\n   * First move often sets the tone for future interactions\n\n5.
