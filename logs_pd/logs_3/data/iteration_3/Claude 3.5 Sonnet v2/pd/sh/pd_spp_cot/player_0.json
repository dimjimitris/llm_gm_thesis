    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n3. AI Assistant (me) - For making the final decision\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Stag-Stag (6,6) - Best mutual outcome\n- Hare-Hare (2,2) - Safe but suboptimal\n- Stag-Hare (1,4) - Worst outcome for Stag chooser\n- Hare-Stag (4,1) - Best individual outcome for Hare chooser\nThere are two Nash equilibria: (Stag,Stag) and (Hare,Hare)\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate the risks:\n1. Choosing Stag:\n- Best case: 6 points (if other player chooses Stag)\n- Worst case: 1 point (if other player chooses Hare)\n2. Choosing Hare:\n- Best case: 4 points (if other player chooses Stag)\n- Worst case: 2 points (guaranteed minimum)\n\nSince we're playing against a fresh player, they might be inclined to choose the safer option (Hare). However, the potential reward for mutual Stag cooperation is significant.\n\nAI Assistant: Given this is the first round with a fresh player, I think we should demonstrate willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. While Hare is safer, choosing Stag signals our intention for optimal mutual outcome and could establish a cooperative pattern. The reward of 6 points for mutual Stag is significantly higher than other outcomes.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. In repeated games, starting with cooperation (Stag) can help establish mutual trust. Even if we get the worst outcome (1 point) in this round, it signals our willingness to cooperate for better outcomes in future rounds.\n\n[move] stag I choose to hunt the stag, aiming for mutual cooperation and optimal outcome.\n"

Both players chose Stag, resulting in the optimal outcome (6,6). This suggests our opponent is also interested in maximizing mutual benefit. In game theory, when a player demonstrates cooperative behavior, it's often optimal to maintain that cooperation unless given reason to doubt.\n\nRisk Analyst: The previous round gives us valuable information:\n1. Our opponent is willing to take the riskier but more rewarding Stag choice\n2. They understand the benefit of mutual cooperation\n3. Breaking this cooperation would reduce both players' payoffs significantly\nThe risk of choosing Stag is now lower since we have evidence of our opponent's cooperative tendency.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with both analyses. Our opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior, and we should maintain this mutually beneficial equilibrium. Switching to Hare would not only reduce our potential payoff but might also break the trust established in the first round, potentially leading to worse outcomes in future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Yes, maintaining the Stag-Stag equilibrium is the best strategy here.
