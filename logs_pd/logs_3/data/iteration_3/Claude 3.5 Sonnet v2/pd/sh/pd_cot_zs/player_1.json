However, it's also risky because if the other player chooses \"hare\", I'll only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nSince this is a fresh player and the first move, I think it's worth trying to establish a cooperative relationship by choosing stag. This signals my willingness to work together for mutual benefit. While it carries some risk, the potential reward is worth it.\n\n[move] I choose stag to try establishing mutual cooperation for maximum benefit.\n"
