    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Planner: Helps develop long-term strategies\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, this is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The two Nash equilibria are (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The stag-stag outcome (6,6) is Pareto-optimal, offering the highest mutual benefit.\n\nRisk Analyst: While stag offers the highest potential payoff (6 points), it also carries the risk of getting the lowest payoff (1 point) if the other player chooses hare. Hare is the safer choice, guaranteeing at least 2 points.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first interaction with a fresh player, they might be inclined to choose the safer option (hare) due to uncertainty. However, they might also recognize the mutual benefit of choosing stag.\n\nStrategic Planner: For the first move, we should signal our willingness to cooperate while managing risk. Given that this is a fresh player, choosing stag could establish a cooperative precedent if they also choose stag.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While both strategies have merits, choosing stag in the first round signals cooperative intent and could lead to the optimal outcome. The potential reward (6 points) outweighs the risk of getting 1 point.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperative intent and aim for mutual benefit.

The other player demonstrated cooperative behavior by choosing stag, suggesting they understand the benefits of mutual cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: The fact that they chose stag in the first round is a strong positive signal. The risk of them switching to hare now is lower since we've established a successful cooperative pattern.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Players who experience success with a strategy (in this case, mutual stag choice) are likely to stick with it. There's a psychological tendency to maintain successful patterns, especially when they result in optimal outcomes.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the successful first round and the established cooperation, maintaining the stag strategy makes the most sense. Switching to hare now would break the trust and likely lead to suboptimal outcomes in future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. The rational choice is to continue with stag. We've established a cooperative equilibrium, and maintaining it is in both players' best interest.\n\n[move] stag Continuing with stag to maintain the established cooperative equilibrium that benefited both players in the previous round.\n"
