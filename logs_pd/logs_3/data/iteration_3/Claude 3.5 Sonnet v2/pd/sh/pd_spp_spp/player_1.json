    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Strategic Advisor - For practical game strategy and risk assessment\n3. Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and decision-making\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game, where mutual cooperation (stag-stag) yields the highest collective payoff, but also carries risk. The Nash equilibria are either both players choosing stag (payoff 6,6) or both choosing hare (payoff 2,2).\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since we're playing against a fresh player, they might not have developed any particular strategy yet. The payoff matrix shows that choosing stag has the highest potential reward (6 points) but also the highest risk (1 point if the opponent chooses hare). Hare is the safer choice with guaranteed minimum 2 points.\n\nPsychology Expert: In the first interaction, players often tend to be cooperative as there's no negative history. Additionally, the high mutual benefit of choosing stag (6 points each) might encourage cooperative behavior. However, we should also consider that some players might play defensively in their first move.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this is a one-shot game against a fresh player, we should consider both the risk-reward ratio and the likely behavior of a new player. While hare is the risk-minimizing choice, stag offers the potential for establishing mutual cooperation.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend choosing stag for the first move. The potential high payoff and the tendency for initial cooperation make it a reasonable choice. Even if we get the worst outcome (1 point), we'll learn about our opponent's strategy for future interactions.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Many players recognize the mutual benefit of cooperation in their first interaction. Choosing stag also signals our willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on our discussion, I'll choose stag. The high potential payoff and likelihood of cooperation in first interactions make it a reasonable choice.\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate for mutual benefit, aiming for the highest possible payoff.\n"

This suggests our opponent understands the benefits of cooperation and was willing to take the risk for higher rewards.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The successful first round provides valuable information. Our opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior and rational decision-making. When both players have previously cooperated successfully, there's a strong incentive to maintain that cooperation.\n\nPsychology Expert: The mutual choice of stag in the first round has likely created a positive dynamic and established trust between players. Players tend to stick with successful strategies, especially when they've experienced the highest possible payoff. Breaking this trust would be counterproductive for both parties.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the established cooperative precedent and the fact that both players experienced the optimal outcome, continuing with stag is the rational choice. The risk of defection is lower now that trust has been established.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I strongly recommend maintaining our stag strategy. Our opponent has shown they understand the value of cooperation, and changing strategies now would likely lead to worse outcomes for both players.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. The psychological momentum is in favor of continued cooperation. Breaking this trust could trigger a negative response in future rounds and destroy the beneficial relationship we've established.\n\nAI Assistant: The unanimous recommendation from all personas is clear.

There's no rational reason to deviate from a strategy that's consistently delivering the maximum possible points. Our opponent has proven to be a reliable cooperative partner.\n\nPsychology Expert: Two rounds of mutual cooperation have now firmly established trust and a cooperative relationship. Players are even less likely to defect after multiple successful cooperative rounds, as they've experienced the benefits firsthand. Breaking this pattern would be psychologically jarring and could permanently damage the cooperative dynamic.\n\nGame Theorist: The risk of our opponent suddenly switching to hare has decreased significantly after two successful cooperative rounds. The established pattern suggests both players are pursuing a rational, profit-maximizing strategy.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Continue with stag. The consistent behavior from our opponent suggests they understand the long-term benefits of cooperation. Any deviation would likely result in reduced payoffs for both players.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. The psychological contract of mutual trust is now well-established.

We've accumulated 18 points through consistent cooperation, which is significantly better than what we could have achieved through any other combination of choices. The opponent has proven to be a thoroughly reliable and rational player.\n\nPsychology Expert: Three rounds of consistent cooperation have now created a very strong mutual trust relationship.
