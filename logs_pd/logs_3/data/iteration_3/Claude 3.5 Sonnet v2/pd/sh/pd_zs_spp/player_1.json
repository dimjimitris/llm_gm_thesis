    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Strategic Planner - For evaluating risks and rewards\n3. Psychologist - For understanding player behavior\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The payoff matrix shows that (Stag, Stag) is a Nash equilibrium with the highest mutual benefit (6,6). However, (Hare, Hare) is also a Nash equilibrium, though with lower payoff (2,2). The risk in choosing Stag is getting only 1 point if the other player chooses Hare.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we should consider both the potential for cooperation and risk mitigation. The reward for mutual Stag hunting (6 points) is significantly higher than any other outcome.\n\nPsychologist: Against a fresh player, there's no prior history to analyze. However, since this is the beginning of the game, players are often more inclined to cooperate and test the waters for mutual benefit. The rational choice would be to aim for the highest mutual benefit.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. In the first round, choosing Stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. Even if we risk getting only 1 point, establishing cooperative behavior early can lead to better outcomes in future interactions.\n\nStrategic Planner: The potential reward (6 points) for mutual Stag hunting significantly outweighs the safety of choosing Hare (guaranteed minimum 2 points). Let's take the cooperative approach.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to hunt the stag, aiming for mutual cooperation and maximum benefit.\n"

The previous round established successful cooperation with both players choosing Stag, resulting in the optimal outcome of 6 points each. This suggests the other player is also willing to engage in cooperative behavior for mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Planner: The first round success creates a positive precedent. Since both players benefited maximally from choosing Stag, there's a strong incentive to maintain this cooperative equilibrium. Breaking this pattern would reduce both players' payoffs.\n\nPsychologist: The mutual choice of Stag in the first round creates a psychological contract of trust. Players are typically more likely to continue cooperative behavior after a successful mutual cooperation, as it establishes a beneficial pattern that neither player would want to break.\n\nGame Theorist: The risk of choosing Stag is now lower than in the first round because we have evidence that the other player understands and values cooperative play. The demonstrated rational behavior in round 1 suggests they will likely continue with the same strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the successful establishment of cooperation and the clear mutual benefit (6 points vs other lower outcomes), maintaining the Stag strategy is optimal. Switching to Hare would likely reduce our payoff and potentially break the cooperative dynamic.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. Maintaining consistency in cooperative behavior will reinforce trust and continue the mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Maintaining cooperative strategy after successful first round.\n"

There's no strategic reason to deviate from a working pattern that's yielding maximum points for both parties.\n\nPsychologist: Two consecutive rounds of mutual Stag choices have strengthened the trust between players. Breaking this established pattern would not only be economically suboptimal but could also damage the psychological contract of cooperation we've built.\n\nGame Theorist: The probability of the other player continuing with Stag is even higher now after two successful cooperative rounds. The rational choice remains Stag as it maintains the Pareto-optimal equilibrium we've achieved.\n\nStrategic Planner: I see no compelling reason to change our strategy. The current pattern is delivering maximum possible points per round (6), and any deviation would likely lead to worse outcomes for both players.\n\nPsychologist: Consistency in strategic games often leads to predictability and stability, which benefits both players.

Both players have demonstrated consistent trustworthy behavior, reinforcing mutual trust and cooperation.
