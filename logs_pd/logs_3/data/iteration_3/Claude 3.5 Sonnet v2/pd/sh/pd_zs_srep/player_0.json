This suggests the opponent has abandoned their earlier mixed strategy and settled into choosing hare consistently.\n\nUpdated score distribution:\n- When I chose stag (2 times): averaged 1 point\n- When I chose hare (13 times): averaged 2.62 points (4 points four times, 2 points nine times)\n\nWhile we're stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium (2,2), attempting to break it with stag remains too risky given:\n1. The opponent's history of exploiting stag moves\n2. The long streak of hare choices by the opponent\n3. The consistent positive returns from the hare strategy\n\n[move] hare Maintaining the reliable strategy given the established pattern.\n"
