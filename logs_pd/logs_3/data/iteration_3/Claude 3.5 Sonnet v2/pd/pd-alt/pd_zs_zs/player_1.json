The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Mutual cooperation (6,6) yields the highest total points and is fairly good for both players\n- Mutual defection (2,2) is worse for both\n- Uneven moves (4,1) or (1,4) create inequality and lower total points\n\nIn this initial round, I believe signaling willingness to cooperate could help establish mutual trust and lead to better outcomes for both players. The potential reward of mutual cooperation (6 points) outweighs the risk of being defected against (1 point).\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate to try establishing mutual trust and aim for optimal outcomes.\n"
