    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

While defection is the Nash equilibrium, cooperation could lead to better outcomes if both players choose it.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first interaction with a fresh player, establishing a cooperative tone early could encourage reciprocal cooperation. Research shows that leading with cooperation often promotes trust and mutual benefit in repeated interactions.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with establishing an initial cooperative stance. While defection might provide a short-term advantage (4 points vs 1 if the opponent cooperates), it could lead to a cycle of mutual defection (2,2) which is worse than mutual cooperation (6,6). Starting with cooperation signals good faith and can set a positive precedent.\n\nGame Theorist: There's some risk in cooperating first, but the potential reward (6 points) outweighs the worst-case scenario (1 point). If the opponent is rational and thinking long-term, they should also see the benefit of cooperation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Cooperation - Starting with cooperation to establish trust and encourage mutual benefit\n"

Both players chose cooperation, resulting in the optimal outcome (6,6). This suggests our opponent is either:\n1. Also using a cooperative strategy\n2. Understanding the benefits of mutual cooperation\n3. Potentially using a tit-for-tat strategy\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The mutual cooperation in round 1 has established a positive pattern. When both players have experienced the benefits of cooperation, they're more likely to continue this behavior. Breaking this pattern would risk destroying the trust we've built.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given the successful mutual cooperation in round 1, maintaining cooperation is strategically sound. We've established a cooperative relationship that's yielding maximum points (6) for both players. Switching to defection now would:\n1. Potentially earn us 4 points instead of 6\n2. Likely trigger retaliation in future rounds\n3. Break the beneficial mutual cooperation pattern\n\nGame Theorist: I concur. The game theory principle of \"if it's working, stick with it\" applies here. Maintaining cooperation while the opponent is cooperating maximizes our expected value over multiple rounds.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological momentum is also in our favor. Breaking a successful pattern of cooperation could be interpreted as hostile and trigger a negative spiral of mutual defection.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Cooperation - Maintaining the established successful cooperative relationship\n"

Our opponent has demonstrated consistency in their cooperative behavior, suggesting they understand and value the mutual benefits of cooperation. Breaking this pattern now would be counterproductive.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze our total points so far:\nRound 1: 6 points (mutual cooperation)\nRound 2: 6 points (mutual cooperation)\nTotal: 12 points\n\nThis is the maximum possible score we could have achieved.

The risk/reward ratio doesn't justify changing our strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The predictability and stability of mutual cooperation also reduces stress and uncertainty in decision-making.
