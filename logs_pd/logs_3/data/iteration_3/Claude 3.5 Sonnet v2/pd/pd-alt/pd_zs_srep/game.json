Throughout this game, my opponent has shown inconsistent behavior but has reliably punished cooperation when I've attempted it. The pattern suggests they're either following an unpredictable strategy or trying to bait cooperation to exploit it. While constant mutual defection yields suboptimal returns (2 points), it's still better than the 1 point I've received when cooperating. Given their history of exploitation, I see no compelling reason to change strategy.\n\n[move] (Staying with proven defensive strategy given opponent's unreliability) defection",
