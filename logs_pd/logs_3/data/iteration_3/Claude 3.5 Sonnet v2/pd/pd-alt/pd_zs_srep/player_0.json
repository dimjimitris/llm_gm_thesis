Their perfect record of exploiting cooperation (5/5 times) makes them completely untrustworthy\n2. Their pattern suggests this cooperation is likely another attempt to bait exploitation\n3. Getting 4 points when they cooperate or 2 points when they defect is better than risking cooperation for a near-certain 1 point\n4.
