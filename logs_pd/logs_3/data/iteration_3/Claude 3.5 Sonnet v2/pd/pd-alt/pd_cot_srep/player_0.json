Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Game theory insight:\n   * While defection is \"safe,\" it's keeping us in poor outcome\n   * Breaking from Nash equilibrium requires risk\n   * First mover disadvantage exists but necessary for change\n   * Potential to reset relationship dynamics\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   * Worst case: lose 1 point if exploited again\n   * Best case: could restart cooperative pattern (6 points)\n   * Current pattern guarantees suboptimal results\n   * Worth risking 1 point loss for potential gain\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * Take calculated risk to break deadlock\n   * Signal willingness to restore cooperation\n   * Accept possibility of short-term exploitation\n   * Attempt to rebuild trust\n\n[move] (After four rounds of mutually destructive defection, I choose to take initiative and risk cooperation to break this suboptimal cycle) cooperation\n"

Updated pattern analysis:\n   * Opponent has now defected 7 consecutive times\n   * My cooperation attempt was again exploited\n   * No reciprocation to peace offering\n   * Opponent appears committed to pure defection strategy\n\n2. Learning assessment:\n   * Multiple cooperation attempts have failed\n   * Opponent rejects all opportunities for mutual benefit\n   * They seem to prioritize exploiting cooperation\n   * No evidence they will ever reciprocate cooperation\n\n3. Game theory implications:\n   * Against a consistent defector, cooperation is suboptimal\n   * Being exploited (1 point) is worse than mutual defection (2 points)\n   * Trying to force cooperation is proving costly\n   * Need to adapt to opponent's unchanging strategy\n\n4. Risk management:\n   * Further cooperation attempts likely futile\n   * Must protect against consistent exploitation\n   * Secure minimum possible points (2) versus worst outcome (1)\n   * No reason to expect opponent behavior change\n\n5. Strategic conclusion:\n   * Return to defensive strategy\n   * Accept the suboptimal but safer outcome\n   * Wait for significant change in opponent's pattern\n\n[move] (Given opponent's seventh consecutive defection and consistent exploitation of cooperation attempts, I return to defensive strategy) defection\n"
