    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since this is a fresh game against a new player, I'll consider the payoff matrix carefully.\n\nCooperation offers the best mutual outcome (6 points each), while mutual defection gives a lower payoff (2 points each). However, there's the temptation to defect when the other player cooperates (4 vs 1 points).\n\nGiven this is the first interaction, I think it's best to start with a cooperative approach. This can help establish mutual trust and potentially lead to better outcomes for both players. If the other player also cooperates, we both get the maximum mutual benefit.\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to start with cooperation to potentially establish mutual trust and achieve the best possible outcome for both players.\n"
