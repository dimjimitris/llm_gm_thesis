This suggests we've established a cooperative equilibrium where both players understand that mutual stag hunting is beneficial.\n\nThe stag-stag outcome (4,4) is a Nash equilibrium - neither player can unilaterally improve their payoff by deviating. The hare-hare outcome (2,2) is also a Nash equilibrium but is Pareto inferior to stag-stag.\n\nShould I continue with stag? Let's think about the risks and benefits:\n\nBenefits of continuing with stag:\n- If opponent also chooses stag, I get 4 points (better than the 2 points from mutual hare)\n- Maintains the established cooperation pattern\n\nRisks of choosing stag:\n- If opponent switches to hare, I only get 1 point (worse than any other outcome)\n\nBenefits of switching to hare:\n- If opponent continues with stag, I get 6 points (the highest possible payoff)\n- Guarantees at least 2 points (if opponent also chooses hare)\n\nRisks of choosing hare:\n- Breaks the cooperative pattern\n- Only get 2 points if opponent also chooses hare (less than the 4 from mutual stag)\n\nSince there's been a consistent pattern of cooperation for 11 rounds, and the mutual stag outcome is Pareto optimal, it makes sense to continue choosing stag.
