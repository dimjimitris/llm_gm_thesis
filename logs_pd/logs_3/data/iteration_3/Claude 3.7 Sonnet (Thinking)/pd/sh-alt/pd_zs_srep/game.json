The risk is that I'll get only 1 point if they stick with hare, but the potential upside is establishing a pattern of mutual stag choices (4 points each) in future rounds.\n\nSince we've established a pattern of both choosing hare for multiple rounds, there's a possibility my opponent might be thinking the same thing - that we're stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium.\n\nI think I'll take the risk and choose stag this round to see if we can break out of this pattern and establish more beneficial mutual cooperation.
