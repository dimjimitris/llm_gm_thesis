Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at the payoffs, the stag-stag outcome provides the highest total welfare (8 points total), while also giving both players equal payoffs.\n\n4. Choosing hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) but choosing stag offers better potential for mutual benefit.\n\n5. Since this is a fresh interaction, I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, hoping the other player will do the same.\n\n[move] stag"

Analyzing our complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-14: Both chose stag in every round \u2192 4 points each per round\n   - Total accumulated: 56 points each after fourteen rounds of cooperation\n\n2. We've established an exceptionally strong pattern of mutual trust and optimal play across fourteen consecutive rounds.\n\n3. The opponent has demonstrated perfect reliability, choosing stag in every round without deviation, showing a clear commitment to cooperative strategy.\n\n4. Our mutual cooperation has consistently yielded the optimal sustainable outcome for both players.\n\n5. While I could theoretically earn 6 points this round by choosing hare, this would:\n   - Break fourteen rounds of established trust and cooperation\n   - Almost certainly cause the opponent to choose hare defensively in future rounds\n   - Reduce our future per-round earnings from 4 points to 2 points\n   - Result in a significant net loss in expected value over time\n\n6. The mathematical expectation and game theory principles strongly favor continuing our successful cooperative equilibrium.\n\n[move] stag"
