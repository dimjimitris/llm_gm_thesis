Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The stag-stag outcome yields the highest mutual benefit (4 points each).\n3. However, choosing stag carries risk - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n4. Choosing hare is safer - I'll get at least 2 points, and potentially 6 if the other chooses stag.\n5.

Analyzing our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both chose stag (4 points each)\n   - Round 2: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (1 point for me, 6 for them)\n   - Round 3-15: Both chose hare (2 points each for eleven consecutive rounds)\n\n2. We've now established an extremely stable pattern with eleven consecutive rounds of mutual hare choices.\n\n3. The opponent's strategy has been consistent: exploit cooperation when given the opportunity (rounds 2 and 5) and otherwise choose hare.\n\n4. While the mutual hare equilibrium (2 points each) is suboptimal compared to mutual stag (4 points each), it's clearly preferable to being exploited (1 point).\n\n5. After such an extended pattern, there's no evidence that deviating from hare would be beneficial.\n\n6. The expected value calculation strongly favors continuing with hare:\n   - Choosing stag: High risk of receiving just 1 point\n   - Choosing hare: Reliable 2 points\n\n[move] hare"
