I note that the times we've both chosen the same action have been:\n- Both hare: Rounds 5 and 11\n- Both stag: Rounds 6 and 12\n\nThere's a pattern here - when we both choose the same action, it seems to alternate between both hare and both stag. The mutual cooperation outcome (both stag) is better for both of us (4 points each vs 2 points each when both hare). I would like to maintain this cooperative equilibrium if possible.\n\nGiven that we just achieved mutual cooperation, I should continue with stag to signal my commitment to this mutually beneficial outcome. This could help establish a pattern of sustainable cooperation.",

After I play hare, the opponent often plays stag (rounds 2, 4, 8, 10, 14).\n\n3. The pattern of \"I play hare \u2192 opponent plays stag\" has been more consistent than any other pattern.\n\nIf I choose stag now, there's a decent chance the opponent will play stag (based on rounds 6 and 12, where we achieved mutual cooperation). However, there's also a significant risk they'll exploit me by playing hare.\n\nIf I choose hare, historical patterns suggest the opponent is likely to play stag, which would give me 6 points.\n\nGiven that my attempts at establishing sustained cooperation have been met with exploitation in subsequent rounds, and the consistently better payoff I've received when playing hare (average of about 5 points per round when playing hare, versus about 1.6 points when playing stag), the rational choice seems to be to play hare again.",
