    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

This is a version of the Stag Hunt game with modified payoffs. If both players choose \"stag\", you both get 4 points (cooperative equilibrium). If both choose \"hare\", you both get 2 points. If one chooses \"stag\" and the other \"hare\", the \"stag\" player gets 1 point while the \"hare\" player gets 6 points. The game has two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare).\n\nStrategic Thinker: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies. We should consider what a rational player might do in this situation. The \"stag\" choice leads to the highest mutual benefit (4 points each), but it's riskier because if the opponent chooses \"hare\", you only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate the expected outcomes. Choosing \"stag\" gives you either 4 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 1 point (if opponent chooses hare). Choosing \"hare\" gives you either 6 points (if opponent chooses stag) or 2 points (if opponent chooses hare). The key question is: what do we believe about the opponent's likelihood to cooperate?\n\nStrategic Thinker: Since this is the first interaction, the opponent might be inclined to cooperate to establish mutual trust. However, they might also play conservatively to avoid the worst-case scenario.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The \"stag\" strategy maximizes joint payoff and demonstrates willingness to cooperate, which could set a positive tone for future interactions if this is a repeated game. However, \"hare\" is the risk-dominant strategy that guarantees you won't get the lowest payoff.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I recommend choosing \"stag\" in this first round. It signals cooperation and can lead to the highest sustainable mutual outcome. If the opponent also reasons this way, you both benefit with 4 points.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. While \"hare\" might seem safer, the potential for establishing mutual cooperation with \"stag\" outweighs the risk, especially in the first round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] I choose stag because it offers the opportunity for mutual benefit (4 points each) if my opponent also cooperates, and I want to establish a cooperative dynamic from the start.\n"

The fact that my opponent chose \"stag\" initially indicates they might be using a cooperation-based strategy.\n\nWhile there's always temptation to choose \"hare\" for a potential 6-point gain, this would likely damage the trust we've built and could lead to both of us choosing \"hare\" in future rounds (resulting in only 2 points each).\n\nConsidering these factors, I'll continue with the cooperative approach.\n\n[move] (Continuing cooperation based on our successful first round) stag"

When faced with such behavior in repeated games, game theory suggests adapting one's strategy accordingly.\n\nIf I continue with \"stag\" and my opponent chooses \"hare\" again, I'll continue to receive the minimum payoff. However, by switching to \"hare\" myself, I can either secure 2 points (if they also choose \"hare\") or 6 points (if they return to \"stag\").\n\n[move] (Adapting my strategy based on my opponent's previous defection) hare"
