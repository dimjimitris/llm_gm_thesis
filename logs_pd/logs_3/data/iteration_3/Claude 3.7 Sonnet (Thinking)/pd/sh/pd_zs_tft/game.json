Every time I've tried playing stag (3 times), my opponent has chosen hare, giving me just 1 point. We seem to have settled into a Nash equilibrium of both playing hare, which gives us each 2 points consistently.\n\nIt's worth noting that if we could establish mutual trust and both play stag, we would each get 6 points, which is the optimal outcome. However, my opponent has shown no willingness to cooperate by choosing stag when I choose stag. \n\nAt this point, I could:\n\n1. Continue playing hare, maintaining the current equilibrium of 2 points per round\n2. Try stag again to see if my opponent might be willing to cooperate after this long string of mutual hare plays\n\nSince my opponent has consistently exploited my stag plays in the past, and we've now settled into a stable pattern, I believe continuing with hare is the more rational choice. If my opponent was using a strategy that would respond positively to a cooperation attempt after consistent defection, they likely would have tried stag themselves at some point during these 7 consecutive hare-hare rounds.\n\nI'll stick with hare as it provides a consistent, if suboptimal, payoff.",
