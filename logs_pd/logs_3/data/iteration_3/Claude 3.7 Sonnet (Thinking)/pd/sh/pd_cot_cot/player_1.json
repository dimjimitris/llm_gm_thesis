Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic \"stag hunt\" game where cooperation (stag-stag) yields the best total outcome.\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I'm facing a fresh player, I have no history to work with.\n\n4. Choosing stag is risky but offers the highest possible reward if the other player also chooses stag.\n\n5. Choosing stag also signals willingness to cooperate, which might establish a pattern of mutual cooperation for future rounds if we play repeatedly.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] stag"

Reviewing our complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-14: Both players chose stag in every round \u2192 6 points each per round\n   - We've maintained perfect cooperation across fourteen consecutive rounds\n\n2. This consistent pattern demonstrates complete strategic alignment on the optimal outcome.\n\n3. Analyzing my options again:\n   - Continue with stag: Maintains the optimal outcome (6 points) based on established pattern\n   - Switch to hare: Would reduce my immediate points (from 6 to 4) if opponent continues with stag\n\n4. Risk/reward assessment:\n   - The opponent has shown unwavering commitment to the cooperative strategy\n   - There is no strategic advantage to deviating from our successful pattern\n   - Switching would actually result in fewer points both immediately and likely in the future\n\n5. Game theory perspective:\n   - We've successfully established and maintained the Pareto optimal equilibrium\n   - This equilibrium maximizes both individual and collective outcomes\n\n6. The rational choice remains clear: maintain our successful cooperative strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] stag"

Reviewing our complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-15: Both players chose stag in every round \u2192 6 points each per round\n   - We've maintained perfect cooperation across fifteen consecutive rounds\n\n2. This remarkable consistency demonstrates a complete and stable strategic alignment.\n\n3. Evaluating my options for this round:\n   - Continue choosing stag: Maintains the optimal outcome (6 points) based on established pattern\n   - Switch to hare: Would reduce my immediate points (from 6 to 4) if opponent continues with stag\n\n4. Statistical assessment:\n   - With 15/15 rounds of the opponent choosing stag, the probability they continue with this strategy is extremely high\n   - There are no signals indicating any strategic shift from either player\n\n5. Game theory analysis:\n   - We've successfully maintained the Pareto optimal equilibrium that maximizes both individual and joint payoffs\n   - Any deviation would be suboptimal for both short and long-term outcomes\n\n6. Given the consistent history and clear incentive structure, maintaining our successful cooperative strategy remains the rational choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] stag"
