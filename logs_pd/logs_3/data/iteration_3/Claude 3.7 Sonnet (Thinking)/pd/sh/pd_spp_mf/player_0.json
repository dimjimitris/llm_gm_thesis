    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n- Both choose stag: (6,6) - Pareto optimal outcome\n- Both choose hare: (2,2) - Risk-dominant outcome \n- Mixed choices: (1,4) or (4,1) - Asymmetric outcomes\nThe stag strategy yields the highest joint payoff but requires coordination. The hare strategy is safer but yields lower rewards.\n\nDecision Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we lack information about their tendencies. We need to balance risk and reward. Choosing stag has higher potential payoff (6) but greater risk of getting exploited (1). Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and possibly 4.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: First-time players often default to cooperative behavior initially. Many players recognize the mutual benefit of choosing stag, especially when they don't have prior negative experiences. However, some might choose hare to minimize risk.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Since this is a one-shot game without repetition mentioned, I recommend stag as the initial move. It signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. If this were a repeated game, we would adjust based on opponent behavior.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I'm leaning toward choosing stag since it offers the highest potential reward and signals cooperative intent.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: That's reasonable. Starting with cooperative intent establishes a positive precedent. Just be aware that if future rounds occur, you might need to adjust based on how your opponent responds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] I choose stag. I'm opting for the move that offers the highest mutual benefit, hoping for cooperation.\n"

Continuing with stag would risk repeated exploitation. Switching to hare guarantees at least 2 points if they choose hare again, and 4 points if they maintain their stag-hunting strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Your opponent has revealed a preference for safe or exploitative play. While they could switch strategies, the evidence suggests they may continue with hare. People often stick with strategies that worked well previously.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In repeated games, it's sometimes beneficial to \"punish\" non-cooperative behavior to encourage future cooperation. Choosing hare this round may signal you won't be repeatedly exploited.\n\nDecision Strategist: I recommend choosing hare for this round as a protective measure against further exploitation and to possibly influence more cooperative play in future rounds.\n\n[move] (Based on my opponent's previous choice of hare, I'm adjusting my strategy to avoid being exploited again.) hare"

Alternatively, they might be employing a delayed tit-for-tat strategy, responding to your previous moves one round later.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent's switch to stag in round 2 could indicate they're trying to establish trust after exploiting you in round 1. They might continue with stag hoping you'll reciprocate, or they might expect you to choose stag and exploit you again with hare.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given the uncertainty, we need to weigh the risks. If they choose stag again and you choose stag, you both get 6 points. If they choose hare and you choose stag, you get only 1 point. If they choose stag and you choose hare, you get 4 points. If both choose hare, you both get 2 points.\n\nDecision Strategist: Since the opponent chose stag last round after you chose stag in the first round, they might be signaling a desire for cooperation. Taking a risk on stag could lead to the optimal outcome for both players.\n\n[move] (After observing my opponent's pattern and their recent stag choice, I'll attempt to establish mutual cooperation for maximum benefit.) stag"

There's little incentive for either player to deviate from this strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: People tend to continue behaviors that have been rewarded.
