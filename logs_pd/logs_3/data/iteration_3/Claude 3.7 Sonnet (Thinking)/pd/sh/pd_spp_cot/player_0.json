    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me collaborate with some experts to determine the best move.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, this is a classic Stag Hunt game. The best joint outcome (Pareto-optimal) is when both players choose stag (6 points each), but there's risk involved if the other player chooses hare (leaving you with just 1 point).\n\nDecision Strategist: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, there's no history to analyze. Choosing stag offers the highest mutual benefit, but hare provides a safety guarantee of at least 2 points.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: First impressions matter in repeated games. Starting with stag signals cooperative intent, which might encourage reciprocity in future rounds. Many players tend to start cooperatively.\n\nGame Theorist: The stag strategy is payoff-dominant (highest possible reward), while hare is risk-dominant (safer option). Without prior information about your opponent, stag is rational if you believe there's a reasonable chance they'll also choose stag.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree. Let's choose stag to maximize potential gain and establish a cooperative precedent.\n\n[move] stag"

When both players consistently choose stag, they maximize their long-term points. There's no strategic reason to deviate from this pattern.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: In repeated games, maintaining cooperation once established typically benefits both parties. The opponent has signaled cooperative intent, and breaking this trust now could lead to retaliation in future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: The rational move is to continue choosing stag since the cooperative equilibrium has been established. The expected value of continuing with stag (assuming your opponent does the same) is 6 points, which exceeds any other strategy.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree. Maintaining the stag strategy reinforces the cooperative equilibrium and maximizes expected returns over multiple rounds.\n\n[move] stag"

Both players have consistently received the maximum payoff of 6 points each round without any deviation.\n\nDecision Strategist: Your opponent has demonstrated perfect reliability in choosing stag across all fourteen rounds. This unbroken pattern provides overwhelming evidence they understand the optimal strategy and will continue to maintain it.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Fourteen rounds of consistent cooperation establishes the strongest possible mutual trust and expectations. The pattern is now so deeply established that deviation would be both surprising and contrary to both players' best interests.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation remains strongly in favor of continuing cooperation. The established equilibrium of mutual stag choices consistently delivers the maximum possible points (6) each round, which is superior to any alternative strategy.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given the established pattern and continued success, I recommend maintaining the stag strategy to preserve the proven cooperative equilibrium.\n\n[move] stag"
