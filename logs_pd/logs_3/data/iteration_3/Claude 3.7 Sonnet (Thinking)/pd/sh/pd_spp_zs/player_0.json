    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Both players chose stag in the first round, achieving the Pareto-optimal outcome of 6 points each. This suggests the opponent recognizes the value of cooperation.\n\nPsychology Expert: When players successfully coordinate on the optimal outcome, there's a strong psychological tendency to continue with the same strategy. The opponent has demonstrated willingness to take the risk of choosing stag, which indicates they're likely to continue this approach.\n\nDecision Theorist: Given that the opponent chose stag in round 1, we should update our probability estimate that they'll choose stag again. This makes choosing stag ourselves even more favorable in expected value calculations.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend continuing with stag. We've established a cooperative equilibrium that maximizes points for both players. Deviating to hare would get us only 4 points instead of 6, and might break the cooperative pattern for future rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. Maintaining consistency after a successful outcome reinforces trust. The opponent likely expects us to continue with stag after the positive result of round 1.\n\nGame Theorist: The (stag, stag) equilibrium is not only Pareto-optimal but also now seems to be established as the focal point of this game.

The opponent has demonstrated consistent trustworthy behavior, and there's a strong expectation that both players will continue the established pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our strategy is working perfectly - we're maximizing our points (12 so far) by coordinating on stag. There's no logical reason to deviate from this successful pattern. Any deviation would likely reduce our payoff and potentially break the trust we've established.\n\nDecision Theorist: Given the opponent's history, the probability they'll choose stag again is very high. Our expected value for choosing stag continues to exceed that of choosing hare. Maintaining our choice of stag is rational and optimal.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The repeated successful coordination on (stag, stag) reinforces this as the focal equilibrium.
