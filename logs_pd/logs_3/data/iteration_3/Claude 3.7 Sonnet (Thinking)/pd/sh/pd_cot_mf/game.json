The key strategic considerations are:\n\n1. The highest joint payoff (6+6=12) comes from mutual cooperation (stag-stag)\n2. Choosing \"hare\" is safer since the worst outcome is getting 2 points, whereas choosing \"stag\" risks getting only 1 point if the other player chooses \"hare\"\n3. However, the maximum possible individual payoff comes from choosing \"stag\" (6 points) if the other player also chooses \"stag\"\n\nSince this is the first round and I'm told I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their tendencies or strategy. In such situations, there are a few approaches I could take:\n\n1. Risk-dominant strategy: Choose \"hare\" since it minimizes my potential loss\n2. Payoff-dominant strategy: Choose \"stag\" for the possibility of maximizing joint payoff\n3. Trust-based approach: Assume cooperation and choose \"stag\" in hopes the other player does the same\n\nI'm going to choose \"stag\" for the first round. My reasoning is:\n- It offers the highest potential payoff if the other player also chooses \"stag\"\n- By choosing \"stag\" I'm signaling cooperation, which might establish a cooperative pattern\n- Since this is the first round, there's no reason to assume the other player will be uncooperative\n- The difference between the worst outcome of \"stag\" (1 point) and the safe outcome of \"hare\" (2 points) is only 1 point, so the risk is relatively small compared to the potential gain of 6 points",

Switching to hare would provide a worse outcome (4 points vs 6 points) and would likely break the established cooperative pattern. This could lead to the other player choosing hare in future rounds as a response, which would give us both only 2 points per round.\n\n5.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
