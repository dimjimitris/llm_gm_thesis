If I continue cooperating and the other player also cooperates (which seems highly likely given their past behavior), we both get 6 points.\n2. If I defect and the other player cooperates (which seems likely given their past behavior), I would get 4 points and they would get 1 point. This is actually fewer points for me than if I cooperate (4 vs 6).\n3. Additionally, if I defect, this could break the trust established over 13 rounds, and the other player might retaliate by defecting in future rounds, resulting in us both getting only 2 points per round.\n\nThe clear optimal strategy is to continue cooperating, as it:\n1. Maximizes my points in this round (6 points instead of 4)\n2. Maintains the trust established, likely ensuring continued mutual cooperation\n\nThere's no logical reason to defect, as it would actually reduce my immediate reward and potentially harm future rewards too.",
