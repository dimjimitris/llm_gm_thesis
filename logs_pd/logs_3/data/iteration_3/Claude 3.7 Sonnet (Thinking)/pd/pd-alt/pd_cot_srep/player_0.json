He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Our extended game history shows a clear pattern:\n   - Round 5: (C,C) \u2192 6 points each\n   - Round 6: (C,D) \u2192 I got 1 point, they got 4\n   - Rounds 7-8: (D,D) \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 9: (C,C) \u2192 6 points each\n   - Round 10: (C,D) \u2192 I got 1 point, they got 4\n   - Rounds 11-12: (D,D) \u2192 2 points each\n\n2. We're now in our second extended mutual defection standoff.\n\n3. The pattern is clear - when I initiate cooperation after defection cycles:\n   - First they cooperate (leading to mutual benefit)\n   - Then they immediately exploit in the next round\n   - Then we fall back into mutual defection\n\n4. We're stuck getting 2 points each in this mutual defection cycle.\n\n5. Despite the risk of exploitation, breaking this cycle could potentially lead back to mutual cooperation (6 points).\n\n6. I'll take one more calculated risk to see if we can escape this suboptimal equilibrium.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll risk cooperation one more time to try breaking the defection cycle.\n\n[move] (Taking another calculated risk to break out of the mutual defection cycle) cooperation"
