The other player has given no indication they might defect, and defecting myself would only reduce my points from 6 to 4 this round while potentially triggering a pattern of mutual defection that would reduce future earnings to 2 points per round.\n\nThe principles of game theory strongly support continuing cooperation in this scenario, as it maintains the optimal equilibrium we've established.
