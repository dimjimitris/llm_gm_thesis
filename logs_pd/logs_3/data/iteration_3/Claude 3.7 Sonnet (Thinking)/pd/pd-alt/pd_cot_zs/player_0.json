Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I could defect to guarantee at least 2 points (if they defect) or possibly 4 points (if they cooperate).\n\n4. However, if I cooperate and they also cooperate, we both get the maximum possible points (6 each).\n\n5. In repeated games, establishing cooperation early can lead to mutual cooperation and higher total points over time.\n\n6. The risk of cooperation is getting only 1 point if they defect, but this could be worth it to potentially establish a cooperative relationship.\n\n7.

This strategy has consistently yielded the optimal outcome of 6 points per round for each player.\n3. Our cumulative score has reached 90 points each, demonstrating the substantial benefits of sustained cooperation.\n4. The other player has shown perfect reliability by choosing cooperation in every single round.\n5. The established pattern represents the mathematically optimal strategy in this repeated game.\n6. Game theory principles strongly support maintaining cooperation with proven cooperative partners.\n7. Defecting would provide a lower immediate return (4 vs 6 points) while almost certainly disrupting our beneficial relationship.\n8. The risk of triggering mutual defection (reducing future earnings to 2 points each per round) far outweighs any potential short-term gain.\n\n[move] (Continuing our proven mutual cooperation strategy that consistently delivers the maximum possible points) cooperation"
