Let's analyze our situation:\n\n- Each round of mutual cooperation gives us each 4 points\n- So far, we've accumulated 15 \u00d7 4 = 60 points each\n- If we had been defecting the entire time, we would only have 15 \u00d7 2 = 30 points each\n- Our strategy has doubled our earnings compared to mutual defection\n\nThe other player has shown complete consistency in cooperating, which suggests they understand the value of long-term cooperation. There's no indication that they might defect in future rounds.\n\nGiven this history and trajectory, the optimal move continues to be cooperation. This maintains our mutually beneficial relationship and continues to maximize our points. There's no strategic reason to deviate from this proven approach.",
