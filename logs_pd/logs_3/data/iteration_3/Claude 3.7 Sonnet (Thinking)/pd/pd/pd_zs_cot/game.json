However, if this might be a multi-round game, starting with cooperation could establish mutual trust leading to better long-term outcomes.\n\n5.

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which means they haven't played against me before.\n\nIn terms of pure self-interest, defection is the dominant strategy in a one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma. If the other player cooperates, I get 6 points by defecting versus 4 by cooperating. If the other player defects, I get 2 points by defecting versus 1 by cooperating. So defection gives me more points regardless of what the other player does.\n\nHowever, if this is going to be a repeated game (which seems likely), then establishing cooperation can lead to better outcomes over time. If both of us keep cooperating, we each get 4 points per round, which is better than the 2 points per round we'd get if we both kept defecting.\n\nGiven that I don't know anything about the other player, I think starting with cooperation is a reasonable approach.
