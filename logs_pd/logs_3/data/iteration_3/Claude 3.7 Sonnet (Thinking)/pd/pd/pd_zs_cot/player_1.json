Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

In a single-round game, defection would be the dominant strategy since it guarantees a better outcome regardless of the other player's choice.\n\n4. However, if this might be a multi-round game, starting with cooperation could establish mutual trust leading to better long-term outcomes.\n\n5. I'll start with cooperation to signal willingness for mutual benefit. If they defect, I can adjust my strategy in future rounds.\n\n[move] cooperation"

The other player has demonstrated perfect reliability in choosing cooperation throughout all rounds.\n\n4. Evaluating my options for this round:\n   - Continue cooperation: likely 4 more points based on established pattern\n   - Defect: potential one-time gain of 6 points, but would break trust\n\n5. If I defect after such a long history of cooperation, the other player would likely switch to defection in subsequent rounds.\n\n6. Mutual defection would yield only 2 points per round, meaning any short-term gain would be quickly negated.\n\n7. The mathematics of repeated games strongly favors sustained cooperation when a stable pattern has been established.\n\n8. With no indication of the game ending soon, maintaining our successful cooperative relationship continues to be the optimal choice.\n\nFinal decision: I will continue cooperating to maintain our mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\n[move] cooperation"
