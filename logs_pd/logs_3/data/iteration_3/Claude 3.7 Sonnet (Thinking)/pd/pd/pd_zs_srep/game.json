The Nash equilibrium is for both players to defect, since regardless of what the other player does, defecting gives a higher individual payoff. However, if both players defect, they each get only 2 points, whereas if both cooperate, they each get 4 points.\n\nI'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which I assume means a new player who hasn't played before. Since this is a one-shot game (as far as I know now), game theory suggests that the rational move is to defect.\n\nHowever, there are a few considerations:\n1. If this turns out to be a repeated game, establishing cooperation early might be beneficial\n2. The \"fresh player\" hint could imply they might naively cooperate\n3. Mutual cooperation yields the highest collective outcome\n\nGiven that I have no prior information about my opponent and cannot establish any trust through communication, the standard game-theoretic approach would suggest defection as the optimal strategy for a one-shot game.\n\nHowever, I'll choose cooperation for this first move, as it:\n1. Offers the possibility of establishing a cooperative norm if this turns into a repeated game\n2. Demonstrates good will\n3. Has the potential for the highest mutual outcome (4 points each)\n4.

And if they switch to cooperation, I would get 6 points by defecting.\n\nGiven the opponent's previous defection, I think it's strategic to defect in this round.

Continue defecting, which guarantees me 2 points per round\n2. Try cooperation again to see if the opponent might change their strategy\n\nGiven that the opponent has consistently defected for 9 rounds, the probability they'll suddenly cooperate seems low. But it might be worth trying cooperation once to see if we can break out of this Nash equilibrium and potentially establish mutual cooperation.\n\nHowever, the rational choice based on past evidence is to continue defecting, as it maximizes my expected payoff given the opponent's demonstrated strategy.\n\nI'll defect again, as it's the safest option based on the opponent's consistent behavior.",

This is risky though, as based on past behavior, they're likely to defect again, leaving me with only 1 point.\n\nFor this round, I think I'll try cooperation one more time.
