The previous attempt had an error in formatting, so I need to make sure the response follows the correct structure.\n\nFirst, the game rules: if both choose stag, they both get 6 points. If both choose hare, they get 2 each. If one chooses stag and the other hare, the stag chooser gets 1 and the hare gets 4. The goal is to maximize points.\n\nThe user is playing against a new player. New players might be unpredictable. The previous response chose hare, maybe thinking that a new player might go for the higher risk/reward of stag, so choosing hare would secure at least 2 points if the other also chooses hare, or 4 if the other goes stag. But the user was told to correct the format, not the move itself.\n\nWait, the error was about the message structure. The initial response had the move message with an explanation in parentheses and then the move. The hint says the move message should start with [move], optional explanation in parentheses, then the move. The correction is needed because maybe the initial response had some formatting issue, like maybe the explanation wasn't in parentheses or there was markdown.\n\nSo the user's previous message was \"[move] Choosing hare to ensure a safer payoff given the uncertainty of a new player's move. hare\" but the correct format should be \"[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\". The problem might be that the explanation wasn't in parentheses, or there was a period instead. So the corrected version should have the explanation in parentheses right after [move], then the move.\n\nSo the correct format would be: [move] (Explanation here) stag or hare.\n\nIn the previous attempt, the user wrote the explanation after [move] but without parentheses. So the corrected message should have parentheses around the explanation. So the correct move message would be \"[move] (Choosing hare to ensure a safer payoff given the uncertainty of a new player's move) hare\".\n\nBut the assistant's previous response had \"hare\" at the end, which is correct. The error was in the formatting of the explanation part. So the assistant needs to resend the move with the explanation in parentheses immediately after [move], then the move.\n\nSo the correct structure is [move] (Explanation) hare.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be formatted exactly like that, with the explanation in parentheses right after [move], no other text, and then the move. The user's strategy of choosing hare might still be valid, but the main issue is the formatting. So the corrected move message should follow the structure precisely.\n",

Maybe they thought cooperating (stag) would get them the higher payoff. But since I chose hare, I took advantage of their choice.\n\nNow, in the next round, I need to decide again. The opponent might be reacting to my previous move. If they chose stag last time and got 1 point, they might switch to hare this time to avoid being exploited again. If I choose stag now, and they switch to hare, I'd get 1 point, which is worse. If I stick with hare and they switch to hare, we both get 2 points. If they stick with stag again, I get 4 again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to establish cooperation. If I switch to stag this time, and they also choose stag, we both get 6 points. But since they're new, they might not trust me after I chose hare last time. So they might expect me to choose hare again and thus choose hare themselves to get 2 points instead of risking 1. \n\nHmm. The safe choice is hare again. If they expect me to repeat, they might go hare, leading to 2 points each. If they try stag again, I get 4. If I switch to stag and they go hare, I get 1. So the risk of switching is higher. Maybe stick with hare for a safer, though possibly lower, payoff. But if I can encourage cooperation, maybe stag is better. But since they just started and I betrayed them once, they might not trust me. So probably better to stick with hare again.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move for the next round. Let me recap the previous rounds to understand the opponent's pattern.\n\nIn the first round, I chose hare, and the opponent chose stag. That gave me 4 points. Then, in the second round, I chose hare again, and the opponent also chose hare, so we both got 2 points. \n\nHmm, so the opponent first went stag when I went hare, then switched to hare in the next round. Maybe they realized that choosing stag when I choose hare is risky because they only get 1 point. So after getting 1 point in the first round, they switched to hare to get a safer 2 points. \n\nNow, if I stick with hare again, the opponent might continue choosing hare, leading to another 2 points each. But maybe if I switch to stag, there's a chance they might still choose hare again, giving me 1 point, which is worse. Alternatively, if they switch back to stag, then we both get 6 points. \n\nBut how predictable is the opponent? Since they're a new player, their strategy might be inconsistent. After two rounds of me choosing hare, they might expect me to keep doing that. If I suddenly choose stag, they might not expect it. But if they're also trying to maximize their points, maybe they'll test choosing stag again. \n\nWait, the first time they chose stag, they got 1 point, which is bad. Then they switched to hare and got 2. So they might stick with hare now. If I choose stag, I risk getting 1 point if they stay with hare. But if they switch to stag, I get 6. Alternatively, if I choose hare again, I get 2 for sure. \n\nBut maybe there's a pattern. If I alternate moves, the opponent might get confused. Or maybe they're trying to mirror my previous move. Since I did hare twice, they might expect hare again. If I switch to stag, maybe they'll stick with hare, leading to me getting 4 points. Wait, no\u2014if I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1. Wait, the payoff matrix: if I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1, they get 4. If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4. \n\nSo in the first round, I chose hare, they chose stag (I got 4). Then I chose hare again, they chose hare (I got 2). If I choose stag now, maybe they'll think I'm trying to get them to switch. But since they just got 2 points by choosing hare, they might stick with it. So if I choose stag now, I might get 1 point. But if they think I'm switching, maybe they'll try stag again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to maximize their own points. If they think I'm going to keep choosing hare, they might choose hare again. But if they think I might switch to stag, they could choose stag to get 6. But since they're new, maybe they're risk-averse. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to coordinate on stag for higher payoff. But how to signal that? Since there's no communication, it's tricky. If I switch to stag now, and they do too, we both benefit. But if they don't, I lose. \n\nGiven that the opponent switched to hare after the first round, they might be playing it safe. So maybe they'll continue with hare. If I choose hare again, we both get 2. If I choose stag, I risk 1 but could get 6. \n\nBut since the opponent is new, maybe they're experimenting. After two hares, they might try stag again. But that's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can alternate. Since I did hare twice, switch to stag to see if they follow. But without knowing their strategy, it's risky. \n\nHmm. The safe choice is hare again, ensuring 2 points. The risky choice is stag, which could be 1 or 6. Given that the opponent is new and might be playing safe, maybe they'll stick with hare. So if I choose stag, I get 1. If I choose hare, I get 2. So maybe better to stick with hare again. \n\nBut wait, maybe the opponent is trying to figure out my pattern. If I always choose hare, they might start choosing hare every time. But if I switch, maybe they'll adjust. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy. They did stag first, then I did hare, so they did hare. If I do hare again, they might do hare again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to maximize their own points. Let's see their payoffs: when they chose stag against my hare, they got 1. Then when they chose hare against my hare, they got 2. So they might prefer hare. \n\nSo if I choose hare again, they'll likely choose hare again, giving me 2. If I choose stag, they might choose hare again, giving me 1. So maybe better to stick with hare. \n\nBut maybe after two hares, they might think I'm going to switch, so they might try stag. If I choose hare, and they choose stag, I get 4. But that's unlikely because they just got 2 points from hare. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to trick them. But without communication, it's hard. \n\nI think the safest bet is to choose hare again, ensuring 2 points. The potential gain from stag is higher, but the risk is also higher. Since the opponent is new and likely risk-averse, they'll probably stick with hare. So I'll go with hare again.\n",

Then the next two rounds, both of us chose hare, so I got 2 each time. Now, the opponent might be catching on to my strategy. If I keep choosing hare, maybe they'll keep doing the same, leading to 2 points each round. But if I switch to stag, there's a risk they might still choose hare, which would give me only 1 point. But if they start trusting me and also choose stag, we both get 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, the opponent is a new player initially. In the first round, they chose stag, which was a bit surprising. Then after I kept choosing hare, they switched to hare. Maybe they're adapting to my moves. If I keep choosing hare, they might stick with hare. But maybe if I switch to stag once, they might think I'm changing strategies. But since they're a new player, maybe they're trying to figure out the best response. If they notice I always pick hare, they might stick with hare to avoid getting 1 point. Alternatively, if they think I might switch, they could try stag to get the higher payoff. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to alternate strategies. But since the opponent is new, they might not have a fixed pattern. The safest bet is still hare to get at least 2 points. But if I want to maximize points, maybe taking a risk with stag could lead to higher rewards. Let me check the payoff matrix again. If I choose stag and they choose stag, 6 each. If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1. If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4. If both hare, 2 each. \n\nGiven that the opponent has chosen hare the last two times, maybe they're settling into a hare strategy. If that's the case, me choosing hare gives 2, but if I choose stag, I get 1. So better to stick with hare. But maybe they might switch back to stag if they think I'm predictable. If they switch to stag, and I choose hare, I get 4. If I choose stag, we both get 6. It's a bit of a gamble. \n\nBut since the opponent is new and has only played a few rounds, they might not have a clear pattern yet. Maybe they're testing different moves. If I keep choosing hare, they might continue with hare for safety. Alternatively, they might try stag again to see if I change. It's hard to predict. The risk of choosing stag is getting 1 point, which is worse than the guaranteed 2. But the potential gain is 6. \n\nConsidering the previous outcomes, the opponent switched to hare after I did. Maybe they're mirroring my moves. If I switch to stag, they might mirror and also choose stag. But if they don't, I lose. Since the opponent is new, maybe they're more risk-averse and will stick with hare. So, perhaps continuing with hare is safer. Alternatively, trying stag once to see if they follow. But since this is a new round, and the game is ongoing, maybe it's worth taking a risk. \n\nWait, the user's previous move was hare three times. If the opponent is adapting, maybe they expect me to keep choosing hare. If they choose stag, they can get 4 points. But if they think I might switch, they might stay with hare. It's a bit of a coordination problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to maximize their own points. If they think I'm always choosing hare, they can choose stag to get 4 points. But in the first round, when they chose stag, I got 4. Then they switched to hare. So maybe they realized that choosing hare when I choose hare gives them 2, which is better than 1 if they choose stag and I choose hare. So they might stick with hare. \n\nIn that case, if I choose hare again, we both get 2. If I choose stag, and they choose hare, I get 1. So maybe safer to stick with hare. But if there's a chance they might switch to stag, then I could get 6. But how likely is that? Since they're a new player, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to signal cooperation by choosing stag once. If they respond with stag, then we both benefit. But if they don't, I lose. But given the previous interactions, they might not trust me yet. \n\nHmm. It's a balance between risk and reward. Since the opponent has been choosing hare the last two rounds, perhaps continuing with hare is the safer choice. But if I want to try for higher points, maybe switch to stag. But the risk is higher. \n\nGiven that the user's goal is to maximize points, maybe taking a calculated risk here. If the opponent is likely to keep choosing hare, then stag would be bad. But if they might switch, then stag is good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is alternating. Let's see: first round they chose stag, then hare, then hare. No clear pattern. Maybe they're sticking with hare now. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest move is hare to ensure at least 2 points. But if I want to try for higher, go stag. However, without knowing the opponent's strategy, it's risky. Since the opponent is new and has chosen hare twice in a row, they might continue. So stick with hare.\n",

Then in the next three rounds, both of us chose hare each time, so I got 2 points each. The opponent seems to be sticking with hare now. If I keep choosing hare, we'll both get 2 points each time. But maybe there's a way to get more points.\n\nIf I switch to stag, what happens? If the opponent is still choosing hare, then I get 1 point and they get 4. That's worse for me. But if the opponent decides to switch to stag, then we both get 6 points. But how likely is that? Since the opponent has been choosing hare consistently after the first round, maybe they're sticking with it. But maybe they're also thinking about switching if they notice I keep choosing hare. \n\nWait, the opponent is a fresh player initially, but after several rounds, they might be adapting. If I keep choosing hare, they might think I'm not going to change, so they might try stag to get a higher payoff. If they switch to stag, and I choose hare, I get 4 points again. But if I choose stag when they do, we both get 6. \n\nBut how to predict their move? Since they've been choosing hare for the last three rounds, maybe they're in a pattern. If I suddenly choose stag, maybe they'll still choose hare, and I get 1. That's risky. Alternatively, if I keep choosing hare, we both get 2. Maybe 2 is better than risking 1. \n\nBut maybe the opponent is getting tired of low payoffs and might try stag. If I switch to stag now, and they do too, we both get 6. That's the best outcome. But it's a risk. Is it worth taking the risk for a higher payoff? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can test the waters by switching once. If they switch to stag, great. If not, I can go back to hare. But since this is a single round, I don't know if there's a next round. The user says \"another round,\" so maybe there are multiple rounds. But the history shows the opponent has been consistent. \n\nHmm. The safe choice is hare for 2 points. The risky choice is stag, which could be 1 or 6. Given the opponent's pattern, they might stick with hare. So maybe staying with hare is better. But if I keep doing the same thing, the opponent might not change. Maybe I should try stag once to see. But the user hasn't indicated any more rounds after this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy. If I choose stag, they might reciprocate. But in the first round, they chose stag when I chose hare, then switched to hare. Wait, the first round I chose hare, they chose stag. Then in the next rounds, they chose hare. So maybe they started with stag, then switched to hare after seeing my hare. So they might be playing hare consistently now. \n\nIn that case, choosing hare again would get 2. Choosing stag would get 1. So better to stick with hare. But maybe the opponent is getting bored and might switch. But without any signs of that, it's safer to stay with hare. \n\nSo the decision is between safe 2 or risk 1/6. Given the opponent's history, likely hare again. So I should choose hare to get 2. But maybe the opponent is expecting me to switch. Wait, if I keep choosing hare, they might think I'm predictable and try to exploit by choosing stag. But in the first round, when they chose stag, I got 4. If they think I'll keep choosing hare, they might switch to stag to get 4 points. But in the subsequent rounds, they chose hare, so maybe they prefer the guaranteed 2 over the risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are also playing it safe. So if I keep choosing hare, we both get 2. If I switch to stag, I risk 1 but could get 6. But given their pattern, it's more likely they'll choose hare again. So maybe stick with hare. \n\nBut wait, the initial hint said the opponent is a fresh player. But after several rounds, they might have learned. However, their moves after the first round have been hare. So perhaps they are sticking with hare. \n\nTherefore, the best move is to continue with hare for a guaranteed 2 points.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out what move to make next in this game. Let me start by recalling the game's rules and the previous outcomes.\n\nThe game has two moves: stag and hare. The payoffs are as follows:\n- If both choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- If both choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- If I choose stag and the opponent chooses hare, I get 1 and they get 4.\n- If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4 and they get 1.\n\nSo far, in the previous rounds, I've been choosing hare every time. The first time, the opponent chose stag, so I got 4 points. Then, in the next four rounds, both of us chose hare, resulting in 2 points each time. The opponent seems to have started with stag once but then switched to hare consistently after that. \n\nNow, the question is, should I continue with hare or switch to stag? Let's analyze the possible outcomes.\n\nIf I keep choosing hare:\n- If the opponent continues with hare, we both get 2 points. That's stable but not the highest payoff.\n- If the opponent switches to stag, I get 4 points again, which is better for me but worse for them. However, since they've been choosing hare consistently, maybe they're sticking with it.\n\nIf I switch to stag:\n- If the opponent is still choosing hare, I get 1 point, which is worse for me.\n- If the opponent also switches to stag, we both get 6 points, which is the best outcome. But given that they've been choosing hare repeatedly, is there a reason for them to switch now?\n\nThe opponent's behavior seems to be sticking with hare. They might be playing it safe, avoiding the risk of getting 1 point if I choose stag. Since we've both been getting 2 points each round, maybe they don't see a reason to change. But if I switch to stag, I risk getting only 1 point if they stay with hare. However, if they notice that I keep choosing hare, maybe they might try to exploit that by switching to stag to get 4 points. Wait, but in the first round when I chose hare and they chose stag, they got 1 point. That's worse for them, so maybe they learned to avoid that by choosing hare. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy. But since I've been choosing hare every time, they might not have a reason to switch. If I suddenly choose stag, they might still choose hare, leading to a worse outcome for me. \n\nIs there a way to signal cooperation? If I switch to stag once, maybe they'll notice and also switch in the next round. But given that we've had several rounds of mutual hare, they might not expect me to change. It's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is a new player each time, but the hints mention \"another round,\" implying it's the same opponent. If it's the same opponent, they might be sticking with hare because it's safe. \n\nConsidering all this, continuing with hare seems safe but suboptimal. Switching to stag could lead to a better payoff if they also switch, but the risk is high. Since the opponent has consistently chosen hare, the probability they'll choose hare again is high. Therefore, sticking with hare ensures 2 points, which is better than risking 1 point. \n\nWait, but maybe after several rounds of mutual hare, the opponent might get bored and try stag. If I switch to stag and they do too, we both get 6. But how likely is that? Without any prior indication of them switching, it's a gamble. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safer choice is to continue with hare. However, if I want to maximize points in the long run, maybe trying stag once to see if the opponent responds could be beneficial. But since the game might end after each round, there's no guarantee of future rounds to capitalize on cooperation. \n\nThe problem is that the instructions don't specify if we're playing multiple rounds with the same opponent or not. The hints say \"another round,\" which might imply a repeated game, but the previous rounds have all been with the same opponent. If it's a repeated game, building trust could lead to higher payoffs. But if it's a one-off each time, then there's no incentive to cooperate. \n\nGiven that the opponent has chosen hare consistently after the first round, they might be playing a safe strategy. Therefore, sticking with hare ensures 2 points. However, if I want to try to get 6 points, I need to take a risk. But given the previous pattern, the risk might not be worth it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they alternate. But in the previous rounds, they didn't alternate; they stuck with hare. \n\nIn conclusion, the safest choice is to continue with hare, ensuring 2 points. The potential gain from switching to stag is high, but the risk of getting 1 point is too great if the opponent stays with hare. Therefore, the optimal move is hare again.\n",

But I remember that if I had chosen stag and the opponent also chose stag, we'd both get 6 points, which is way better. The problem is, if I switch to stag now, what's the opponent going to do?\n\nLet me think. The opponent has been choosing hare every single time. Maybe they're sticking to a safe strategy, not wanting to risk getting 1 point if I choose stag while they choose hare. But since we've both been getting hare repeatedly, maybe they're expecting me to keep doing the same. If I suddenly switch to stag, there's a chance they might still choose hare, which would give me 1 point and them 4. That's worse for me. But if they also switch to stag, then we both get 6. \n\nBut why would the opponent switch? They've been consistently choosing hare. Maybe they're a new player who's cautious. If I keep choosing hare, we both get 2, which is better than the risk of getting 1. But over time, maybe the opponent will realize that if they switch to stag, they can get a higher payoff if I also switch. But how do I signal that I want to cooperate for mutual benefit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy. If I start choosing stag, they might respond in kind next round. But since they've been choosing hare every time, maybe they're not. Hmm. It's a bit of a dilemma. The safe choice is to keep choosing hare and get 2 points, but the optimal choice if both cooperate is stag for 6. \n\nWait, the first time I chose hare, the opponent chose stag, and I got 4 points. Then in the next rounds, they switched to hare. Maybe they learned from that first round. So after I got 4 points by choosing hare when they chose stag, they started choosing hare to avoid getting 1 point. So now they're stuck on hare. If I want to get a higher payoff, I need to somehow encourage them to switch to stag. But how?\n\nIf I switch to stag once, maybe they'll notice and switch too. But if they don't, I lose. But maybe after several rounds of mutual hare, they might be willing to try stag again. Alternatively, maybe they're just always choosing hare no matter what. In that case, I should stick with hare.

But given that the opponent has been choosing hare consistently after the first round, maybe they're not going to switch. \n\nSo the question is: is it worth the risk to switch to stag now, hoping the opponent also switches, or continue with hare for the guaranteed 2 points. If I switch and they stay with hare, I get 1 point, which is worse. If I switch and they switch, we both get 6. If I stay with hare, we both get 2. \n\nGiven that the opponent has been choosing hare for the last five rounds, maybe they're not going to change. So the safe bet is to keep choosing hare. But maybe after so many rounds, they might get bored and try stag. But that's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they mirror my last move. But in the first round, I chose hare, they chose stag, then in the next rounds, they switched to hare. So maybe they're not mirroring. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is a new player who is also trying to figure out the best strategy. If I keep choosing hare, they might think that's the norm and keep doing it. If I switch to stag, maybe they'll follow. But there's no guarantee. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to stick with hare to avoid the risk of getting 1 point. But if I want to maximize points in the long run, maybe taking a risk once in a while could pay off. But since this is a single round, not a series, maybe the opponent's strategy is fixed. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"another round\" each time, so it's a repeated game. But the opponent's behavior has been consistent. So maybe they're programmed to always choose hare. If that's the case, then I should always choose hare. But if there's a chance they might switch, then maybe I should try stag once. \n\nBut given that in the first round when I chose hare, they chose stag, and then after that, they switched to hare, maybe they're adapting. So after getting 4 points in the first round, they realized that choosing hare is safer. So they might continue with hare. \n\nIn that case, sticking with hare is the safe choice. But if I want to maximize, maybe I can try stag once. But the risk is high. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy. If I choose stag, they choose stag. But since I've been choosing hare, they choose hare. But in the first round, they chose stag, which doesn't fit tit-for-tat. \n\nHmm. This is tricky.

It's safe but not the highest possible. The highest mutual payoff is 6 each if we both choose stag. But since the opponent hasn't shown any willingness to switch to stag, maybe it's too risky. Alternatively, maybe I can try stag again to see if they change their strategy. But last time I tried that, they didn't. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they're also observing my moves. If I keep choosing hare, they might think I'm not going to change. But if I try stag again, maybe they'll notice and start cooperating. But given the previous attempt failed, maybe it's better to stick with hare to avoid the risk of getting 1 point again. Yeah, probably safer to keep choosing hare.\n",

Now, they're considering their next move.\n\nThe user's strategy so far has been to stick with hare to maintain a stable payoff. However, since the opponent hasn't reciprocated when they tried stag, maybe it's time to test again. If the opponent is still on hare, switching to stag would only get 1 point, which is worse. But if the opponent starts cooperating, stag could lead to 6 points. But given the history, the opponent is likely to keep choosing hare. So maybe sticking with hare is safer. Alternatively, maybe the opponent will notice the user's consistent hare and try stag themselves. But that's a risk. The user's goal is to maximize points. Since the opponent hasn't changed, safest bet is to keep choosing hare for 2 points rather than risk 1. But maybe after several rounds of hare, the opponent might switch. Hmm. But the user tried stag once and it didn't work. Maybe the opponent is a tit-for-tat player? But no, they kept choosing hare even after the user switched back. So probably best to keep with hare for now.\n",

The user tried switching to stag once, but the opponent stuck with hare, resulting in a lower score. Now, the user is considering their next move.\n\nThe game's payoff matrix shows that mutual stag gives higher points (6 each), but if one defects to hare while the other chooses stag, the defector gets 4. However, mutual hare is safer but lower reward. Since the opponent has been choosing hare repeatedly, the user might think that the opponent is risk-averse and won't switch to stag. \n\nBut maybe the user should try to signal cooperation again. If the user switches to stag, there's a risk of getting 1 point if the opponent stays with hare. But if the opponent notices the user's attempt to cooperate and also switches, both get 6. However, given the history, the opponent hasn't reciprocated before. \n\nAlternatively, continuing with hare ensures 2 points, which is better than risking 1. The user's previous attempt to switch to stag didn't work, so maybe it's safer to stick with hare. But perhaps the opponent's strategy could change if the user persists with stag for a few rounds. But the user tried once, and the opponent didn't follow. \n\nGiven the opponent's consistent choice of hare, the rational choice might be to keep choosing hare to avoid lower payoffs. The user's goal is to maximize points, so unless there's a sign the opponent will cooperate, hare is safer. So the next move should be hare again.\n",
