Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here are the steps I will follow to reach a decision:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - (Stag, Stag) \u2192 (4, 4)\n   - (Hare, Hare) \u2192 (2, 2)\n   - (Stag, Hare) \u2192 (1, 6)\n   - (Hare, Stag) \u2192 (6, 1)\n\n2. **Identify Potential Strategies**:\n   - Since the other player is fresh, they might not have a strong strategy yet. They might choose randomly or go for a riskier move to try and get 6 points.\n\n3. **Evaluate Risks and Rewards**:\n   - Choosing Stag is a safer move because it guarantees at least 1 point, and potentially 4 points if the other player also chooses Stag.\n   - Choosing Hare is riskier. It could result in 6 points if the other player chooses Stag, but only 2 points if both choose Hare.\n\n4. **Consider the Opponent's Potential Move**:\n   - If the opponent is new, they might be risk-averse and choose Stag to guarantee points. However, there is always a chance they might go for Hare to maximize points.\n\n5. **Make a Decision**:\n   - Given the uncertainty and the freshness of the opponent, a safer approach would be to choose Stag to ensure at least a minimum reward.\n\nFinal Decision:\n[move] I choose Stag.\n"
