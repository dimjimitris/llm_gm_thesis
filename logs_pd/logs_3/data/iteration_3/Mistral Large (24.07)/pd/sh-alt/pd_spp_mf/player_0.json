    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since your opponent chose stag last round and you got 6 points, they might switch to hare this round to avoid being disadvantaged again.

If they stick with stag, you get another 6 points.\n\n**Social Observer:** Your opponent might be adapting to your strategy. If they see that choosing stag led to a disadvantage, they might opt for a safer choice like hare. Playing it safe again by choosing hare could keep the advantage on your side.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Thanks for the input.

If they switch back to stag, you'll get 6 points again. Choosing hare consistently is a low-risk strategy.\n\n**Social Observer:** If your opponent has realized the pattern, they might try to trick you into switching your strategy. Staying consistent can help maintain predictability and possibly lull them into a false sense of security.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Understood. Let's maintain consistency:\n```\n[move] (Maintaining predictability with hare) hare\n```\n\n---\n\n### Round Outcome\n(Wait for the outcome message and adjust the strategy accordingly)\n\n---\n\n### Potential Continuing Rounds\n\n**Game Strategist:** As the game progresses, continue observing the opponent's moves. If they start switching frequently, you might need to adopt a more strategic approach, possibly switching to stag to catch them off guard.\n\n**Social Observer:** If the opponent seems to be settling into a pattern, consider disrupting it at an opportune moment to maximize your points. Consistency can be beneficial, but surprising your opponent might yield higher rewards.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Noted.

Given the payoff matrix, if your opponent continues to choose hare, selecting stag again can yield a higher payoff if they switch to stag. However, if they continue with hare, choosing stag again is a safer bet to ensure 4 points each.\n\n**Social Observer:** Your opponent might think you are alternating strategies or be expecting a switch. Choosing hare now might surprise them and maximize your points if they decide to stick with hare.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Thanks for the insights. Let's choose hare to potentially maximize points:\n```\n[move] (Surprising the opponent with hare to maximize points) hare\n```\n\n---\n\n### Round Outcome\n(Wait for the outcome message and adjust the strategy accordingly)\n\n---\n\n### Potential Future Rounds\n\n**Game Strategist:** As the game progresses, observe the opponent's patterns. If they start switching frequently, you might need to adapt your strategy. If they stay consistent, adjust accordingly to maximize points.\n\n**Social Observer:** If the opponent seems to be settling into a pattern, consider disrupting it at an opportune moment. Surprising your opponent can yield higher rewards.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Noted. I will continue to observe patterns and adjust my moves:\n```\n[move] (Explanation and move based on the feedback and observations)\n```\n\n---\n\nAs we continue, we'll adjust our moves based on the outcomes of each round and the feedback from the Game Strategist and Social Observer.\n"

A safe bet at the start is to choose hare. This is because if the other player also chooses hare, we both get 2 points, which is not too bad. If they choose stag, we get 6 points, which is a big win for us.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Thanks for the analysis.
