    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The stag move is riskier but offers higher rewards if both players choose it. The hare move is a safer choice with moderate rewards but can give a huge payoff if the other player chooses stag.\n\n**Analyst**: Let's analyze the payoff matrix. If you choose stag and the other player also chooses stag, both get 4 points. If you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 point and the other player gets 6. If you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1. If both choose hare, both get 2 points. The question is: what move maximizes your points and minimizes your penalties?\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given this is our first round and the other player is fresh, I think it's safe to assume they might play conservatively with hare. So, a strategic move would be to choose stag to potentially get 4 points if they also choose stag or minimize the penalty if they choose hare.\n\n**Strategist**: That makes sense. Playing stag in the first round can help you gauge the other player's strategy. If they also choose stag, you both get moderate rewards. If they choose hare, you only lose 1 point, which isn't too bad for the first round.\n\n**Analyst**: Statistically, if the other player is fresh, there's a higher likelihood they might choose the safer option of hare. In that case, choosing stag gives you a chance to get 4 points or lose minimally with 1 point.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Alright, based on the analysis and strategy, let's go ahead with stag for the first move.\n\n[move] (Choosing stag for the first move to gauge the opponent's strategy) Stag\n\nLet's wait for the other player's move and the outcome.\n"

If they think you will choose stag, they might choose hare to maximize their points.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the analysis, it might be beneficial to choose hare this round. If the opponent chooses stag, I will get 6 points. If they choose hare again, both of us will get 2 points, which is a safe outcome.\n\n**Analyst**: Yes, choosing hare minimizes the risk of getting only 1 point again. It's a safer choice and could potentially give you a high reward if the opponent chooses stag.\n\n**Strategist**: Agreed. Choosing hare is a more defensive move that ensures you don't fall into the same trap as the first round. It also leaves the opponent uncertain about your strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Alright, let's go with hare for the second round.\n\n[move] (Choosing hare to balance risk and reward) Hare\n\nLet's wait for the other player's move and the outcome of this round.\n"

Here are the personas we will collaborate with:\n\n1. **Strategist**: An expert in game strategy who can analyze different scenarios and provide insights on the best moves to make.\n2. **Analyst**: An expert who can provide detailed statistical analysis and reasoning based on the payoff matrix and previous moves.\n\nLet's start the collaboration for this round.\n\n**Strategist**: In the last round, both players chose hare, resulting in both scoring 2 points. The opponent might continue to choose hare for safety, or they might switch to stag to maximize their points if they anticipate you choosing hare again.\n\n**Analyst**: Given the payoff matrix, if the opponent chooses hare again, you have a chance to gain 4 points by choosing stag. If the opponent switches to stag, you get 1 point, which is a moderate penalty.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the previous round, it's likely that the opponent might switch to stag to maximize their points if they anticipate you choosing hare again. To counter this, I could choose stag this round.\n\n**Strategist**: That's a strategic move. If the opponent switches to stag, you both get 4 points. If they choose hare again, you only get 1 point, but it's a calculated risk.\n\n**Analyst**: Statistically, switching to stag this round could yield higher rewards if the opponent switches as well. If they don't switch, you still have a moderate penalty of 1 point.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Alright, let's go with stag for the next round.\n\n[move] (Choosing stag to potentially match the opponent's strategically switched move) Stag\n\nLet's wait for the other player's move and the outcome of this round.\n"
