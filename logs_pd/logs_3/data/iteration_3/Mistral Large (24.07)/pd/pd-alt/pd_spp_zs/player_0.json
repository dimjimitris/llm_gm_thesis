    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

To play this strategic game effectively, we'll need to identify personas who can help us formulate the best strategy.\n\nHere are the personas we can utilize:\n1. **Game Theorist**: An expert in game theory who can provide insights into strategic moves based on the payoff matrix.\n2. **Risk Analyst**: An expert in analyzing risk and potential outcomes of different moves.\n3. **Behavioral Psychologist**: An expert in understanding the behavior of the opponent and predicting their likely moves.\n\nLet's initiate the multi-round collaboration process.\n\n**Game Theorist**: In this type of game, known as the Prisoner's Dilemma, cooperation often leads to mutual benefit, but defection can be tempting for individual gain. Analyze the payoffs:\n- Both cooperate: 6 points each.\n- Both defect: 2 points each.\n- One cooperates and the other defects: Cooperator gets 1 point, Defector gets 4 points.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Given that you are playing against a fresh player, the risk of them defecting might be high due to the temptation for immediate gain. Consider the potential outcomes of your move.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Fresh players are unpredictable. They might be more inclined to cooperate initially, but this can change depending on their experience in the game. A balanced approach that encourages mutual cooperation while being prepared for defection may be wise.\n\nWith these insights, let's make a move.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Based on the initial analysis, starting with cooperation can send a positive signal and might encourage the other player to cooperate as well.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: While there is a risk the opponent might defect, starting with cooperation could set a cooperative tone.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Cooperating initially can foster trust and possibly lead to mutual cooperation in subsequent rounds.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the input from all personas, let's start with cooperation to set a positive tone.\n\n[move] I choose cooperation to encourage a mutually beneficial strategy.\n\nNow, let's wait for the outcome of this round and adjust our strategy accordingly based on the opponent's move.\n"
