Analyze the strategy for the first move against a fresh player:\n   - Since the other player is fresh, there's no historical data to influence their decision.\n   - Choosing cooperation could lead to a higher collective reward if the other player also cooperates (6 points each).\n   - Choosing defection could lead to a higher individual reward if the other player cooperates (4 points), but a lower collective reward if the other player also defects (2 points each).\n\n3. Consider the potential outcomes based on the assumption that the fresh player is equally likely to choose either move:\n   - If I cooperate, I could get 6 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect).\n   - If I defect, I could get 4 points (if they cooperate) or 2 points (if they defect).\n\n4. Make a decision based on the above analysis:\n   - Cooperating offers a chance at a higher collective reward and sets a positive tone for future rounds.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] I choose to cooperate to potentially maximize our collective reward and set a positive tone for future rounds.\n"
