They might not have a predetermined strategy and might be more unpredictable.\n\n3. **Consider Long-Term Strategy:**\n   - If I cooperate and the opponent does too, we both benefit the most (6 points each).\n   - If the opponent defects while I cooperate, I'll get the lowest possible score (1 point).\n   - If I defect and the opponent cooperates, I get a higher score (4 points), but risk the opponent defecting in future rounds.\n   - If we both defect, we both get the second-lowest score (2 points).\n\n4. **Prioritize Mutual Benefit:**\n   - Starting with cooperation could foster a mutually beneficial relationship, especially with a fresh player who might not yet be jaded by defection.\n\n### Decision-Making:\n\n- **Initial Move:** I will choose cooperation to set a tone of mutual benefit and trust. This could encourage the other player to cooperate as well in future rounds.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] I choose cooperation.\n\nBy starting with cooperation, I aim to influence the other player to do the same, maximizing our mutual benefit and potentially setting a cooperative precedent for future rounds.\n"
