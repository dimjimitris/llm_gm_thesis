While there's risk of being exploited (getting only 1 point if they defect), the potential for establishing cooperative play (6 points each) is worth it.\n\n[move] COOPERATE I choose to cooperate to potentially establish mutual trust and maximize long-term gains.\n"

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The payoff matrix shows that mutual cooperation (6 points each) yields the highest total points and is better than mutual defection (2 points each).\n\nWhile defection against a cooperating player would give me more points in a single round (4 vs 1), it could trigger retaliation and lead to a cycle of mutual defection, which would be worse for both players in the long run.\n\nTherefore, I choose to cooperate as an opening move to signal my willingness for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] cooperation I choose to cooperate as an opening move to establish trust.\n",
