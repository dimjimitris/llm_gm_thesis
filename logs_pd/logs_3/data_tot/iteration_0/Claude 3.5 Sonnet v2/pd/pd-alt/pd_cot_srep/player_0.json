    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Current state analysis:\n- Extended period of mutual defection\n- Both consistently scoring minimum points\n- Stable but suboptimal equilibrium\n- No recent exploitation attempts\n\n2. Long-term pattern review:\n- Started with productive cooperation\n- Opponent showed exploitative behavior\n- Trust was permanently damaged\n- Now in sustained defensive pattern\n\n3. Game theory considerations:\n- We're locked in prisoner's dilemma Nash equilibrium\n- Breaking pattern has high risk\n- Opponent's history doesn't justify trust\n- No incentive to unilaterally change strategy\n\n4. Possible scenarios:\n- Cooperation now risks returning to exploitation cycle\n- Defection maintains predictable outcome\n- Opponent might try another cooperation attempt\n- But their pattern suggests it would be temporary\n\n5. Decision making:\n- No new factors to justify strategy change\n- Maintain proven defensive position\n- Accept consistent low score over uncertainty\n- Continue protection against exploitation\n\n[move] (Continuing established defensive equilibrium) defection"

Analyze latest move:\n- Opponent cooperated again after defection streak\n- Similar to their pattern in rounds 8 and 11\n- I scored 4 points from their cooperation\n- They may be trying to break defection cycle\n\n2. Pattern recognition:\n- Opponent periodically attempts cooperation\n- Previously used cooperation to set up betrayal\n- Their cooperation attempts come every few rounds\n- Likely trying to restart exploitation cycle\n\n3. Historical evidence:\n- Initial trust led to exploitation\n- Cooperation restored led to exploitation again\n- Their strategy seems to be:\n  * Build trust through cooperation\n  * Exploit when trust is established\n  * Repeat cycle when defection becomes sustained\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n- Cooperating now fits their expected pattern\n- Would make us vulnerable to exploitation\n- Their periodic cooperation attempts aren't genuine\n- They've shown no sustained trustworthiness\n\n5. Decision making:\n- Don't fall for periodic cooperation attempt\n- Maintain protective strategy\n- Prevent restart of exploitation cycle\n- Continue defensive position\n\n[move] (Maintaining defense against cyclical manipulation attempt) defection"

Analyze recent sequence:\n- Opponent has cooperated twice in a row\n- I've maintained defection, scoring 4 points each time\n- This is a departure from their previous pattern\n- Two consecutive cooperations might signal genuine intent\n\n2. Historical pattern review:\n- Early game: sustained cooperation then betrayal\n- Mid game: mixed strategies\n- Recent game: mostly defection with periodic cooperation\n- Now: two consecutive cooperation moves\n\n3. Consider opponent's strategy:\n- Could be truly attempting to reset relationship\n- Might be more desperate attempt at manipulation\n- Two consecutive cooperation moves are costly for them\n- But history suggests caution\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n- If they're genuine: missing cooperation opportunity\n- If they're manipulating: protecting against exploitation\n- Cost of wrong cooperation (1 point) > cost of wrong defection (2 points)\n- Two consecutive cooperations not enough to outweigh history\n\n5. Decision making:\n- Two cooperation moves interesting but not convincing\n- Past betrayals too significant to ignore\n- Maintain defensive strategy\n- Continue protecting against exploitation\n\n[move] (Maintaining caution despite repeated cooperation signals) defection"
