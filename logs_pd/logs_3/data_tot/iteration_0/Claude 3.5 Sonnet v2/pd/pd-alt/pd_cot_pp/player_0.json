Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the payoff matrix:\n   - Mutual cooperation: 6 points each\n   - Mutual defection: 2 points each\n   - Uneven choices: 4 points for defector, 1 point for cooperator\n\n3. Key considerations:\n   - Mutual cooperation yields the highest combined points (12 total)\n   - Mutual defection yields the lowest combined points (4 total)\n   - The temptation to defect exists because it could yield 4 points if other player cooperates\n\n4. Strategic thinking:\n   - Starting with cooperation can establish goodwill\n   - It signals willingness to achieve mutual benefit\n   - Even if the other player defects, losing 1 point in first round is acceptable to learn about opponent\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Choose cooperation to maximize potential mutual benefit\n   - This sets a positive tone for potential future interactions\n   - The risk (getting 1 point) is worth the potential reward (6 points)\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate to establish mutual trust and maximize potential mutual benefit.\n"

Historical success analysis:\n   - Taking cooperation initiative has twice led to mutual cooperation\n   - Yes, opponent later betrayed, but initial cooperation was successful\n   - Mutual defection guarantees suboptimal outcomes\n   - Worth risking one low round (1 point) for chance at high reward (6 points)\n\n3. Risk vs reward:\n   - Current mutual defection: guaranteed 2 points\n   - Successful cooperation: potential 6 points\n   - Failed cooperation: risk 1 point\n   - Breaking cycle has historically improved outcomes\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - Break out of mutually destructive cycle\n   - Initiative previously succeeded in similar situations\n   - Potential gain outweighs temporary risk\n   - Create opportunity for higher scores\n\n[move] (Breaking mutual defection cycle for potential higher payoff) cooperation\n"

Risk calculation:\n   - Maintaining cooperation: high risk of getting minimum points (1)\n   - Previous two attempts at sustained cooperation failed\n   - Opponent has shown consistent pattern of betrayal\n   - Defecting first prevents exploitation\n\n4.
