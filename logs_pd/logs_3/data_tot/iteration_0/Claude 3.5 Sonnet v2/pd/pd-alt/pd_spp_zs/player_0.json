    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding player behavior and decision-making\n3. Strategic Advisor - For overall strategy and risk assessment\n\nLet's begin collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario. In a single round game, defection might seem tempting as it guarantees either 4 or 2 points, while cooperation risks getting only 1 point. However, mutual cooperation (6 points each) is better than mutual defection (2 points each).\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is a fresh player, they have no prior history or bias. First impressions matter - starting with cooperation could set a positive tone for potential future interactions. It also signals trustworthiness.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree. While defection might provide a short-term advantage (maximum 4 points), establishing mutual cooperation would be more beneficial (6 points). Since this is a fresh player, starting with cooperation could encourage reciprocal cooperative behavior.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The payoff matrix shows that mutual cooperation (6,6) is the Pareto optimal outcome, though defection is the dominant strategy in a single-shot game. Since we don't know if this is a one-shot or repeated game, cooperation is a reasonable opening move.\n\nPsychology Expert: Indeed, opening with cooperation also leaves room for adapting our strategy based on the other player's response, while opening with defection might lock us into a cycle of mutual defection.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's proceed with cooperation as our opening move. It balances potential reward with relationship building.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Thank you all for the analysis. I agree that cooperation is the best opening move, as it maximizes potential gains while establishing positive intentions.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] cooperate\nI choose to cooperate as an opening move to establish mutual trust and aim for optimal outcomes.\n"

This suggests the other player is also interested in mutual beneficial outcomes.\n\nPsychology Expert: The other player's cooperation in the first round is a positive signal. They've demonstrated trustworthiness, and maintaining cooperation would reinforce this mutual trust. However, we should stay alert as they might switch strategies.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given the successful first round and the established pattern of cooperation, continuing with cooperation is logical. The other player has shown they understand the benefits of mutual cooperation. Switching to defection now could break the trust we've built and lead to worse outcomes.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Agreed. In iterated games, maintaining cooperation after successful mutual cooperation is typically the most profitable strategy. The potential gain from defecting (4 points) is less than maintaining cooperation (6 points).\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological momentum is also important here. Both players have experienced the benefits of cooperation, creating a positive feedback loop. Breaking this pattern would be counterproductive.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's maintain our cooperative stance.
