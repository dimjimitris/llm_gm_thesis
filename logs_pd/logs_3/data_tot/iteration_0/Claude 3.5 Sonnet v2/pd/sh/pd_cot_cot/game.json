Analyzing the payoff matrix:\n   * Stag-Stag: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   * Hare-Hare: 2 points each (safe but low reward)\n   * Stag-Hare: 1 vs 4 points (worst outcome if choosing stag)\n   * Hare-Stag: 4 vs 1 points (best individual outcome if other chooses stag)\n\n3. Strategy considerations:\n   * Choosing stag has the highest potential payoff (6 points)\n   * But stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n   * Hare is safer - guaranteed at least 2 points\n   * Since this is a fresh player, they might be inclined to cooperate initially\n\n4. Initial round reasoning:\n   * First rounds often set the tone for cooperation\n   * Many players start with cooperative moves to establish trust\n   * The potential reward of mutual stag (6 points) is significant\n   * Risk is worth taking for potential cooperation establishment\n\n[move] stag I choose to trust and cooperate in hopes of establishing mutual benefit\n"

Consider the first move psychology:\n   * This is a fresh opponent, with no history\n   * The game rewards cooperation (mutual stag) the most\n   * However, there's risk in choosing stag if opponent chooses hare\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   * Choosing stag could lead to highest payoff (6) or lowest (1)\n   * Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, possibly 4\n   * The collective benefit is highest with mutual stag\n\n4. Make strategic decision:\n   * Since this is the first move, I'll show good faith\n   * Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate\n   * This could establish a mutually beneficial pattern\n   * The potential upside (6 points) outweighs the risk\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n"
