Recent pattern:\n   - Round 12: I hare, they stag (4 points)\n   - Round 13: Both hare (2 points)\n   - Round 14: Both hare (2 points)\n   - Round 15: Both hare (2 points)\n\n2. Current situation analysis:\n   - We've returned to stable mutual hare equilibrium\n   - Three consecutive rounds of mutual hare\n   - Similar to earlier game sequence\n   - Both players accepting suboptimal but stable outcome\n\n3. Game theory perspective:\n   - We're in a Nash equilibrium\n   - Neither player has incentive to unilaterally change\n   - Previous attempts to break this pattern led to exploitation\n   - Mutual hare is self-reinforcing strategy\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   - Opponent has proven:\n     * Willing to exploit cooperation\n     * Capable of strategic deception\n     * Returns to hare after manipulation attempts\n     * Punishes stag choices\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - No new information suggests strategy change\n   - Stable pattern is providing consistent returns\n   - Previous deviations were costly\n   - Must maintain defensive position\n\n[move] hare Continuing established equilibrium strategy.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Key considerations:\n   * Choosing stag offers the highest mutual benefit (6 points)\n   * But stag is risky - if other player chooses hare, I get minimal points (1)\n   * Hare is safer - guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 4\n\n4. First move strategy:\n   * In first interactions, many players tend to be cooperative\n   * Starting with cooperation can establish mutual trust\n   * The potential reward (6) for mutual stag is worth the risk\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   * Choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate\n   * Potential for maximum mutual benefit outweighs the risk\n   * Sets positive tone for any future interactions\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate for mutual benefit",
