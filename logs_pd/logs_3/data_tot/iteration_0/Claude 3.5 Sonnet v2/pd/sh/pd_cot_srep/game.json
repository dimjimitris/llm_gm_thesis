He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

        "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. This is a classic coordination game similar to the Stag Hunt, where cooperation (stag) yields the highest mutual benefit.\n\n2. Analyzing the payoffs:\n   * Stag-Stag: (6,6) - Best mutual outcome\n   * Hare-Hare: (2,2) - Mediocre but safe outcome\n   * Stag-Hare: (1,4) - Worst outcome for me if I choose stag alone\n   * Hare-Stag: (4,1) - Best individual outcome if other chooses stag\n\n3. Since this is the first round:\n   * There's no prior history to base decisions on\n   * The other player is also fresh, so might be inclined to cooperate\n   * The potential reward for mutual cooperation (6) is significantly higher\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   * Choosing stag is risky but has highest potential reward\n   * If the other player thinks similarly, they might also choose stag\n   * The difference between success (6) and failure (1) with stag is large\n\n5. Decision consideration:\n   * First impressions matter\n   * Setting a cooperative tone early might encourage continued cooperation\n   * The potential reward outweighs the risk in this initial round\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate and aim for mutual benefit in this first round.\n",
        "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. First, let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n   * Stag-Stag: Both get 6 (best cooperative outcome)\n   * Hare-Hare: Both get 2 (safe but low reward)\n   * Stag-Hare mismatch: Stag gets 1, Hare gets 4 (stag gets punished)\n\n2. Consider the strategic aspects:\n   * Choosing stag has the highest potential payoff (6)\n   * But stag is also risky - if other player chooses hare, I only get 1\n   * Hare is safer - guarantees at least 2, possible 4\n\n3. Since this is:\n   * The first round\n   * Against a fresh player\n   * No prior history\n   * No established trust\n\n4.
