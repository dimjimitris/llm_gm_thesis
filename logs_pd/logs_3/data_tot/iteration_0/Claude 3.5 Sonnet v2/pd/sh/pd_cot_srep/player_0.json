Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n   - Stag + Stag = 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Hare + Hare = 2 points each\n   - Stag + Hare = 1 point for stag, 4 points for hare\n   - Hare + Stag = 4 points for hare, 1 point for stag\n\n3. Analyzing potential strategies:\n   - Stag is risky but has highest mutual benefit (6 points)\n   - Hare is safer but lower reward (guaranteed minimum 2 points)\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare, I get worst outcome (1 point)\n\n4. Since this is the first move with a new player:\n   - It's an opportunity to establish cooperative behavior\n   - Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate\n   - Could lead to mutual high scores if opponent also cooperates\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - The potential reward (6 points) outweighs the risk\n   - Want to encourage cooperative play from the start\n   - Even if I get betrayed, it sets a clear message about cooperation\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to encourage mutual cooperation and maximize potential points."

Recent game history focus:\n   - Round 9: I hare, they stag (4 points)\n   - Round 10: I hare, they stag (4 points)\n   - Round 11: I stag, they hare (1 point)\n   - Round 12: I hare, they stag (4 points)\n\n2. Opponent's pattern analysis:\n   - Three out of last four moves have been stag\n   - They betrayed immediately when I chose stag\n   - They seem to be alternating between:\n     * Using stag to try to bait me\n     * Exploiting when I actually choose stag\n\n3. Points evaluation:\n   - When I stay with hare against their stag: 4 points\n   - When I tried stag: got punished with 1 point\n   - They might be trying to establish a pattern to exploit\n   - Current hare strategy is yielding optimal results\n\n4. Game theory implications:\n   - Opponent appears to be using a complex manipulation strategy\n   - They're willing to take losses to influence my choices\n   - My best response has been consistent hare\n   - No reason to deviate from successful counter-strategy\n\n5. Risk management:\n   - Switching to stag has proven costly\n   - Current hare strategy is providing maximum possible points (4)\n   - Opponent's stag choices are likely tactical, not cooperative\n   - Need to maintain defensive position\n\n[move] hare Maintaining successful defensive strategy that's yielding optimal points."

Opponent behavior analysis:\n   - They've shown highly variable strategy\n   - Used stag moves to try to influence my choices\n   - Punished my stag attempt\n   - Just switched back to hare unexpectedly\n\n3. Pattern observation:\n   - Opponent seems to be:\n     * Unpredictable in their choices\n     * Adaptive to my moves\n     * Possibly trying to prevent any stable pattern\n     * Successfully keeping me off balance\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   - Stag remains high risk given opponent's behavior\n   - They've proven willing to exploit cooperation\n   - Hare provides consistent protection\n   - Can't predict their next move reliably\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Need to maintain defensive posture\n   - Can't trust apparent patterns\n   - Must protect against potential exploitation\n   - Better to ensure minimum points than risk getting 1 point\n\n[move] hare Maintaining defensive strategy against unpredictable opponent."

Risk assessment:\n   - Stag remains dangerous given history\n   - Opponent has proven untrustworthy\n   - Current mutual hare is suboptimal but stable\n   - Any deviation likely to be punished\n\n5.
