    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Advisor - For developing winning strategies\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential outcomes and risks\n4. Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding opponent psychology\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game in game theory. Looking at the payoff matrix:\n- Stag-Stag: (6,6) - Best mutual outcome\n- Hare-Hare: (2,2) - Safe but suboptimal\n- Stag-Hare: (1,4) - Worst outcome for Stag chooser\n- Hare-Stag: (4,1) - Best individual outcome\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we should consider both risk and potential reward. The stag choice offers the highest mutual benefit (6 points) if both players cooperate.\n\nRisk Analyst: However, choosing stag is risky - if the opponent chooses hare, we only get 1 point while they get 4. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, and could yield 4 points if opponent chooses stag.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: With a fresh player, they might be inclined to choose the cooperative option (stag) to establish good faith. The payoff matrix encourages cooperation for mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this is the first move, I suggest choosing stag for these reasons:\n1. It signals willingness to cooperate\n2. It enables the highest possible mutual outcome\n3. Fresh players often start with cooperative moves\n4. Even if we lose this round, it establishes a precedent for cooperation\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While hare is the risk-minimizing choice, stag offers the best potential outcome and sets a positive tone for any future interactions.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to aim for mutual cooperation and maximum benefit. This signals a willingness to work together for the optimal outcome.\n"

This suggests our opponent is rational and understands the benefits of cooperation.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The previous successful cooperation creates a precedent. When both players have experienced the benefits of mutual cooperation, they often tend to maintain it.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior. In repeated games, players who have successfully cooperated tend to stick with that strategy unless given a reason to deviate.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's assess our options:\n1. Maintaining stag: \n- If opponent stays cooperative: 6 points (optimal)\n- If opponent defects: 1 point (worst outcome)\n2. Switching to hare:\n- If opponent stays cooperative: 4 points (opportunistic)\n- If opponent defects: 2 points (safe)\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given that:\n1. We've established successful cooperation\n2. Both players benefited maximally from the previous round\n3. There's no indication of aggressive or deceptive behavior\n4. Breaking cooperation would reduce potential future cooperation\n\nI recommend maintaining our stag strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. In repeated games, maintaining cooperation after a successful cooperative round is generally the optimal strategy, as it builds trust and maintains the highest possible consistent payoff.\n\n[move] stag Maintaining cooperative strategy after successful mutual cooperation in the previous round.\n"
