You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n- Mutual stag: 6 points each (best cooperative outcome)\n- Mutual hare: 2 points each\n- Mixed choices: 4 points for hare chooser, 1 point for stag chooser\n\nThe stag choice offers the highest potential reward (6) if both players cooperate, but also the biggest risk of getting exploited (1). The hare choice guarantees at least 2 points and could yield 4 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\nHowever, in the spirit of promoting cooperation and achieving the best possible outcome for both players, I'll choose stag. While this carries some risk, it signals my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for the optimal mutual outcome.\n"
