    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the payoffs:\n   * Stag + Stag = 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   * Hare + Hare = 2 points each (safe but low reward)\n   * Stag + Hare = 1 point vs 4 points (worst outcome if choosing stag)\n   * Hare + Stag = 4 points vs 1 point (best individual outcome if others choose stag)\n\n3. Key considerations:\n   * This is the first move against a fresh player\n   * Stag offers the highest mutual benefit (6 points)\n   * But Stag is risky - if other player chooses Hare, I only get 1 point\n   * Hare is safer - guarantees at least 2 points\n\n4. Strategy decision:\n   * Since this is the first interaction, I want to signal willingness to cooperate\n   * The potential reward of mutual Stag (6 points) is worth the risk\n   * Building trust early could lead to better outcomes in future rounds\n   * The other player might follow similar logic\n\n[move] stag\n"

Complete game history analysis:\n   * Round 1: I Stag, They Hare (1 point)\n   * Round 2-12 summary: I mostly played Hare, getting consistent 2 or 4 points\n   * Round 12: I Hare, They Stag (4 points)\n   * My Hare strategy has yielded reliable results\n\n2. Performance metrics:\n   * Hare plays (9 times): 4,2,4,2,4,2,4,2,4 points (average 3.11)\n   * Stag plays (3 times): 1,6,1 points (average 2.67)\n   * Hare strategy has been superior both in consistency and average returns\n   * Never received less than 2 points with Hare\n\n3. Opponent's recent behavior:\n   * They just played Stag (got exploited)\n   * Their pattern suggests they might be frustrated with getting exploited\n   * They might switch to Hare out of defensive positioning\n   * Or they might persist with Stag hoping to establish cooperation\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   * Maintain the Hare strategy\n   * It's proven optimal over multiple rounds\n   * The risk/reward ratio continues to favor Hare\n   * No compelling reason to deviate from a successful strategy\n   * Even if opponent is frustrated, changing strategy introduces unnecessary risk\n\n[move] hare\n"
