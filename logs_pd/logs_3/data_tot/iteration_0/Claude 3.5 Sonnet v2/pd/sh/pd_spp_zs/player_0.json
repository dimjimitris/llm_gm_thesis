    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Strategic Planner - for evaluating risks and rewards\n3. Behavioral Psychologist - for understanding opponent psychology\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The payoff matrix shows that (Stag, Stag) is a Nash equilibrium with the highest mutual benefit (6,6). However, (Hare, Hare) is also a Nash equilibrium, though with lower payoff (2,2). The risk in choosing Stag is that if the other player chooses Hare, you only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given that we're playing against a fresh player, we should consider what a rational player might do in their first move. The safest option is Hare, which guarantees at least 2 points, whereas Stag is risky but offers the highest potential reward.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first interaction, the opponent has no prior experience or bias. Many players tend to choose the safer option (Hare) in their first move due to risk aversion. However, some players might recognize the mutual benefit of choosing Stag and take that risk.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend choosing Stag for the first move. While it's risky, it sets a cooperative tone and allows for the highest mutual benefit. If both players choose Stag, it can establish a pattern of cooperation for future rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. The potential reward (6 points) outweighs the risk (1 point) in this case. Even if we get the worst outcome this round, we can adjust our strategy based on the opponent's behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Stag - Choosing to establish a cooperative relationship for mutual benefit\n"

The previous round established a successful cooperative equilibrium where both players chose Stag and received the maximum payoff of 6 points. This suggests our opponent understands the value of cooperation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The fact that the opponent chose Stag in the first round indicates they are willing to take calculated risks for mutual benefit. When both players succeed with a cooperative strategy, they tend to stick with it unless given a reason to change.\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent's behavior suggests they are rational and understand the game's optimal outcome. Given that we've established mutual trust with successful cooperation in the first round, there's strong incentive for both players to maintain this beneficial arrangement.\n\nGame Theorist: I strongly recommend maintaining the Stag strategy. The opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior, and changing our strategy now would break the trust we've established and likely lead to worse outcomes for both players.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. Breaking the cooperative pattern now would likely trigger a defensive response from the opponent in future rounds, potentially leading to both players choosing Hare and getting stuck in the lower-payoff equilibrium.\n\nStrategic Planner: The risk level is actually lower now compared to the first round because we have evidence of the opponent's cooperative tendency. Maintaining the Stag choice is both the most profitable and most logical move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Stag - Maintaining the established cooperative strategy for mutual benefit\n"

This has created a stable, optimal Nash equilibrium that benefits both players.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological momentum is clearly in favor of continued cooperation. Both players have demonstrated consistent trustworthy behavior, and there's a strong social contract now established. Breaking this pattern would be counter-productive and could damage the cooperative dynamic we've built.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's analyze the risks:\n1. Continuing Stag: High probability of another 6-point outcome based on established pattern\n2. Switching to Hare: Could get 4 points if opponent stays with Stag, but would likely destroy trust and lead to lower payoffs in future rounds\n3. The opponent has shown no signs of deviation and has equally benefited from this strategy\n\nGame Theorist: The game theory principle of \"don't fix what isn't broken\" applies here. We're achieving the optimal outcome repeatedly, and there's no strategic advantage to deviating from this successful pattern.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. The opponent's consistent behavior suggests they understand the value of cooperation.

This is a textbook example of a stable, cooperative equilibrium in repeated games. The pattern is robust and both players are clearly committed to maximizing mutual benefit.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The repeated successful cooperation has now created a strong psychological contract between the players. With three rounds of consistent behavior, the trust level is at its peak. Any deviation at this point would be seen as an unexpected betrayal and would likely trigger a permanent shift away from cooperation.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's evaluate our position:\n1.
