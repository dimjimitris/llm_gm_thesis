    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - Specializes in evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n3. Behavioral Psychologist - Understands human decision-making patterns\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Stag-Stag (6,6): Best mutual outcome\n- Hare-Hare (2,2): Safe but suboptimal\n- Stag-Hare (1,4) or Hare-Stag (4,1): Risk of exploitation\n\nRisk Analyst: For the first move against a fresh player, we need to consider both the potential reward and risk:\n- Choosing stag offers the highest potential payoff (6) but also the risk of getting exploited (1)\n- Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and potential for 4 points, with less downside risk\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first interaction, the other player has no prior experience with us. Many players tend to choose the safer option (hare) in their first move due to uncertainty. However, establishing cooperative behavior early can lead to better long-term outcomes.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend choosing stag for the first move. It signals willingness to cooperate and achieve the optimal outcome. While there's risk, the potential reward (6 points) is significant.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. The potential upside of 6 points outweighs the risk of getting only 1 point. Plus, it sets a positive precedent for cooperation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Concur. Starting with stag can help establish trust and encourage cooperative behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit\n"

Both players chose stag, achieving the optimal outcome (6,6). This suggests the other player is also willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The fact that they chose stag in the first round is a strong positive signal. Players who start with stag often continue this cooperative strategy unless given reason to deviate. This suggests they understand the benefits of mutual cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: The previous success with stag reduces our uncertainty about the other player's strategy. They've demonstrated cooperative behavior, making stag a less risky choice now than it was in round 1.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the successful mutual cooperation in round 1, deviating to hare would be suboptimal. It would:\n1. Break the established trust\n2. Lead to lower payoffs for both players\n3. Potentially trigger retaliation in future rounds\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Maintaining the cooperative equilibrium is crucial. Players tend to reciprocate both positive and negative actions, so maintaining trust is key.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk-reward ratio strongly favors continuing with stag. We've established a profitable cooperative pattern, and there's no strategic reason to deviate from it.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Building on our successful cooperation from the previous round\n"

Two rounds of successful cooperation have built trust and established clear expectations. Breaking this pattern would be counter-productive as it could destroy the trust we've built.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's look at the current situation:\n- We've accumulated 12 points (6+6) through consistent cooperation\n- The other player has demonstrated reliability in two consecutive rounds\n- The risk of them suddenly switching to hare has decreased due to the established pattern\n- Maintaining stag continues to offer the highest expected value\n\nGame Theorist: I strongly recommend maintaining our stag strategy. The game theory principle of \"don't fix what isn't broken\" applies here - we've found a stable, optimal strategy that benefits both players.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. The other player has shown consistent cooperative behavior, and humans tend to maintain successful patterns unless given a reason to change.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk-reward profile continues to favor stag. While there's always a theoretical risk of defection, the established pattern of cooperation makes this less likely.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Maintaining our successful cooperative strategy for mutual benefit\n"
