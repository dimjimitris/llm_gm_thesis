While choosing stag carries some risk (I could only get 1 point if they choose hare), the potential reward for mutual stag hunting (6 points) is significant.\n\n[move] stag I choose to take an optimistic, cooperation-focused approach for this first move, hoping to establish mutual trust and maximize potential gains.\n",

While I could try stag again hoping they learn to cooperate, their first move suggests they might prefer the safer/exploitative strategy.\n\nIn this situation, I think it's better to protect myself from being exploited again.\n\n[move] hare Since my opponent showed non-cooperative behavior in the first round, I'll choose hare to secure at least 2 points and potentially 4 points if they try stag.\n",

Responding to my previous move with an opposite move\n\nGiven this pattern, my opponent might expect me to reciprocate with stag now, either out of fairness or predicted pattern.
