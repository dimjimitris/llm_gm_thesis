    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Considering strategic aspects:\n   * Stag is the most mutually beneficial choice (4 points each)\n   * But it's also risky - if other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n   * Hare is safer but leads to lower payoff if both choose it\n\n3. First move psychology:\n   * This is a fresh player with no history\n   * In first moves, players often tend to choose cooperative options\n   * The highest mutual benefit comes from both choosing stag\n\n4. Risk vs. reward evaluation:\n   * While hare is safer, it caps potential gains\n   * Stag offers the best cooperative outcome\n   * Worth taking the risk for potential higher payoff\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   * For first move, best to signal willingness to cooperate\n   * Stag choice could establish mutually beneficial pattern\n   * Risk is acceptable for potential reward\n\n[move] stag\n"

Opponent behavior assessment:\n   * They seem to use cooperation as bait\n   * Pattern suggests they deliberately break trust\n   * They likely expect me to continue cooperation\n   * Shows sophisticated but exploitative strategy\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   * Continuing stag would likely lead to another exploitation\n   * Opponent has shown no commitment to sustained cooperation\n   * They've established a clear pattern of betrayal after cooperation\n   * Trust has been repeatedly broken\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   * Opponent's consistent betrayal pattern requires defensive response\n   * No evidence they will maintain cooperation\n   * Need to protect against further exploitation\n   * Switching to hare is optimal response\n   * Could either get 2 points (mutual hare) or 6 points (if they try stag)\n   * Can reassess only if opponent shows multiple rounds of consistent cooperation\n\n[move] hare\n"

Pattern recognition:\n   * Opponent follows a predictable cycle:\n     - Cooperates with stag\n     - Exploits with hare when we play stag\n     - Returns to stag after being punished\n   * This pattern has repeated multiple times\n\n3. Strategic analysis:\n   * Opponent's last stag move was predictable\n   * They likely expect me to reciprocate with stag\n   * This would fit their pattern of exploitation\n   * They've shown no commitment to sustained cooperation\n\n4.

Strategic consideration:\n   * Current mutual hare (2,2) is suboptimal\n   * Opponent might expect me to continue hare\n   * They might attempt stag to break deadlock\n   * First mover advantage exists if they switch to stag\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   * Given opponent's history of alternating strategies\n   * Their frustration with being exploited might lead to stag attempt\n   * Maintaining hare is safer and potentially more profitable\n   * If they play stag, I get 6 points\n   * If they play hare, I get 2 points but remain protected\n   * No compelling reason to risk stag given opponent's history\n\n[move] hare\n"
