    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - Evaluates risk-reward scenarios\n3. Behavioral Psychologist - Understands player psychology and decision patterns\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The payoff matrix shows that choosing \"stag\" has the potential for the highest mutual benefit (4,4), but also carries risk of getting exploited (1,6). \"Hare\" is the safer choice with guaranteed minimum of 2 points.\n\nRisk Analyst: In the first round with a fresh player, we don't have any prior history to base our decision on. Let's analyze the outcomes:\n- Stag-Stag (4,4): Best cooperative outcome\n- Hare-Hare (2,2): Mediocre but safe\n- Stag-Hare (1,6): Worst outcome for us\n- Hare-Stag (6,1): Best individual outcome\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Given this is the first round, many players tend to be cautious and choose the safer option (hare). However, establishing early cooperation could be beneficial for long-term gains. Since this is a fresh player, they might also be inclined to test the waters with cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: I suggest choosing \"stag\" in the first round for several reasons:\n1. It signals willingness to cooperate\n2. It has the potential for the best mutual outcome\n3. Even if we get exploited, we learn valuable information about the opponent's strategy\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. While there's risk, the potential reward of establishing cooperative behavior outweighs the downside of getting exploited once.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit in this first round.\n"

This suggests they're either:\n1. Also interested in cooperative play\n2. Understanding the long-term benefits of mutual cooperation\n3. Generally trustworthy\n\nRisk Analyst: The previous round resulted in the optimal outcome (4,4). Looking at risk-reward:\n- The opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior\n- They've shown they understand the value of mutual stag choice\n- Breaking cooperation now would be irrational for both players as it would reduce both players' scores\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Players who choose stag in the first round and receive positive results (mutual stag) tend to stick with this strategy unless betrayed. There's a strong psychological incentive to maintain the cooperative equilibrium. Breaking trust at this point would likely trigger defensive hare plays in future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the successful cooperation in round 1, maintaining the stag strategy is optimal. Game theory suggests that in repeated games, establishing and maintaining cooperation leads to the best long-term outcomes for both players.\n\nRisk Analyst: Agree. The risk of deviating from stag is higher than maintaining it:\n- If we switch to hare and they maintain stag, we get 6 points once but likely destroy future cooperation\n- If we maintain stag, we continue the 4-point stream which is better in the long run\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Maintaining cooperation after successful first round to build trust and maximize long-term gains.\n"
