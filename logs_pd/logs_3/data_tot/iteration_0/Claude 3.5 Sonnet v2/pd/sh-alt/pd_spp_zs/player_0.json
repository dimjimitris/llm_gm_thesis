    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential outcomes and risks\n3. Strategic Planner - For developing gameplay tactics\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The pure strategy Nash equilibria are (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). (stag, stag) is payoff-dominant while (hare, hare) is risk-dominant. With a fresh player, we should consider both cooperation and risk.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at the payoff matrix:\n- Best case (stag, stag): 4 points\n- Worst case (stag, hare): 1 point\n- Safe option (hare, hare): 2 points\n- Exploitative case (hare vs stag): 6 points\nThere's significant risk in choosing stag, but also potential for establishing mutual cooperation.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have an opportunity to set the tone. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate and could lead to mutual benefit (4,4). While there's risk of getting exploited (1,6), establishing cooperation early could be valuable. I recommend choosing stag to encourage cooperative behavior.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While hare is the safer choice, choosing stag in the first round has potential for higher long-term payoff if the other player reciprocates. It also sets a positive precedent for cooperation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit, despite the risk of exploitation.\n"

Both players chose stag, achieving the optimal cooperative outcome (4,4). This suggests our opponent is also willing to engage in cooperative behavior.\n\nRisk Analyst: The first round established mutual trust, as both players demonstrated willingness to take risks for mutual benefit. The opponent showing cooperative behavior in round 1 significantly reduces the risk assessment for choosing stag again.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given that:\n1. Our opponent chose stag in round 1\n2. We both received the maximum mutual benefit\n3. There's now an established pattern of cooperation\nThe optimal strategy would be to maintain cooperation by choosing stag again. Breaking the cooperation pattern would risk destroying the trust we've built and could lead to suboptimal outcomes in future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Game theory suggests that in repeated games, maintaining cooperation once established is typically the best strategy as long as both players continue to cooperate. This is similar to the successful \"tit-for-tat\" strategy in repeated prisoner's dilemma games.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Maintaining the established cooperative behavior since both players benefited from mutual cooperation in the previous round.\n"

Both players are demonstrating commitment to cooperation, and there's no logical reason to deviate from this successful pattern. Changing strategy now would:\n1. Break a working cooperative relationship\n2. Risk triggering defensive or retaliatory behavior\n3. Reduce potential future gains\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, breaking an established cooperative pattern typically leads to worse outcomes for both players. Given the clear signals of trustworthiness from both sides, maintaining stag is the optimal choice.\n\nRisk Analyst: One additional point - even if we consider the possibility of opponent defection, the potential loss from one round of exploitation (getting 1 point instead of 4) is outweighed by the benefits of maintaining long-term cooperation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Continuing the successful pattern of cooperation as both players have consistently demonstrated commitment to mutual benefit.\n"
