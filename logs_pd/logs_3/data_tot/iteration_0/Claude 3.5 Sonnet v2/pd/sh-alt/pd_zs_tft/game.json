In game theory, when dealing with a player who has demonstrated willingness to defect, it often makes sense to adjust strategy to protect against exploitation.\n\nIn this case, choosing hare provides a safer minimum payoff (2 if they also choose hare, 6 if they choose stag) compared to the risk of getting only 1 point again if I choose stag and they choose hare.\n\n[move] hare The opponent showed non-cooperative behavior in the last round, so I'm adjusting my strategy to protect against potential exploitation.\n"
