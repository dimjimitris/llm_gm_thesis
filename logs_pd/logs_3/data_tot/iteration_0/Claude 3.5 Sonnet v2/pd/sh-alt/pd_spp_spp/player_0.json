    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Planner - For long-term planning and decision making\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating different outcomes and their probabilities\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Stag-Stag: (4,4) - Best mutual outcome\n- Hare-Hare: (2,2) - Safe but suboptimal\n- Stag-Hare: (1,6) - Worst outcome for stag chooser\n- Hare-Stag: (6,1) - Best individual outcome\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we need to consider what's most likely for them to choose. The safest option would be Hare, but that would lead to suboptimal outcomes if both players always choose it.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate the risks:\n- Choosing Stag: Potential for highest mutual benefit (4), but risk of lowest payoff (1)\n- Choosing Hare: Guaranteed minimum of 2, with potential for 6\nHowever, since this is the first move, showing cooperative intention might encourage reciprocity.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. In repeated games, establishing cooperation early can lead to better long-term outcomes. Starting with Stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Planner: The first move is crucial for setting the tone. While Hare is safer, choosing Stag could establish a cooperative pattern that benefits both players.\n\nRisk Analyst: The potential reward of mutual cooperation (4) outweighs the risk of getting exploited (1) in this case, especially since we're dealing with a fresh player who has no established pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate for mutual benefit and signal trustworthiness to the other player.\n"

This suggests our opponent is also willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent's choice of Stag in the first round is a strong positive signal. They demonstrated willingness to take risks for mutual benefit rather than playing it safe with Hare.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our options for round 2:\n1. Continue with Stag: \n- Pros: Maintains cooperative momentum, could lead to continued optimal outcomes\n- Cons: Risk of opponent switching to Hare for a higher one-time gain (6)\n2. Switch to Hare:\n- Pros: Could get 6 points if opponent stays with Stag\n- Cons: Breaks trust, likely leads to future mutual Hare choices (2,2), worse long-term outcome\n\nGame Theorist: Given that the opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior, game theory suggests maintaining cooperation is the optimal strategy. Breaking trust now could lead to a breakdown of cooperation in future rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: Agree. The established cooperation is valuable. Breaking it for a one-time gain would be short-sighted. Both players seem to understand the benefits of mutual cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: The first round has reduced our risk assessment for choosing Stag again.

They appear to be following a long-term cooperative strategy, just like us.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate the current situation:\n- Pattern established: 2/2 rounds of mutual Stag choices\n- Cumulative points: 8 points (4+4)\n- Trust level: High\n- Risk of defection: Lower than initial rounds due to established pattern\n\nGame Theorist: The game theory principle of \"reputation building\" suggests that both players have invested in building trust. At this point, deviating from the established pattern would be suboptimal for either player's long-term interests.\n\nStrategic Planner: Continuing with Stag is aligned with both short-term and long-term objectives. We've established a mutually beneficial relationship that's generating consistent optimal outcomes.\n\nRisk Analyst: While there's always a theoretical risk of the opponent switching to Hare, the established pattern and demonstrated mutual understanding of benefits makes this less likely than in previous rounds.
