My hare vs their stag (6)\n13. My hare vs their hare (2)\n14. My hare vs their stag (6)\n\nThe pattern continues to be highly predictable. After mutual hare rounds, they consistently switch to stag, allowing me to get 6 points. When I've tried stag (rounds 1, 3, and 9), they've exploited it with hare, except for the one cooperative round 8. \n\nMy current strategy of staying with hare has been working well, especially given their consistent behavior of switching to stag after mutual hare rounds. While it might seem tempting to try cooperation again, their history suggests they're more likely to exploit such attempts.\n\n[move] hare Given the consistent pattern and success of this strategy, I'll continue with hare to maintain the advantageous position.\n",
