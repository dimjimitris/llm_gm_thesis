    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n3. Decision Strategist - For making final decisions based on various inputs\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The payoff matrix shows that (stag, stag) is a Nash equilibrium with the highest mutual benefit (4,4), but it requires trust and coordination. (hare, hare) is also a Nash equilibrium but with lower payoff (2,2). The risk in choosing stag is getting only 1 point if the other player chooses hare.\n\nRisk Analyst: For a first move against a fresh player, we need to consider both the potential reward and risk. The best outcome (4 points) comes from mutual stag hunting, while the worst outcome (1 point) comes from choosing stag while the opponent chooses hare. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 6 points.\n\nDecision Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we should consider establishing trust and encouraging cooperation. The stag strategy has the potential for the best sustainable outcome if the other player reciprocates. While it carries some risk, it signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. In repeated games, starting with cooperative behavior (stag) can help establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, which leads to the best long-term outcome for both players.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's choose stag for our first move. This shows our willingness to cooperate and can potentially lead to the optimal outcome of mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit.\n"

This suggests our opponent is also willing to engage in cooperative behavior and understands the benefits of mutual cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: The previous round's success establishes a positive precedent. The opponent has demonstrated trustworthiness by choosing stag, which reduces our risk assessment for this round. However, we should still be aware that they could switch strategies.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given that our opponent proved cooperative in the first round, maintaining the same strategy seems optimal. Switching to hare now would:\n1. Break the established trust\n2. Likely result in worse outcomes in future rounds if the opponent retaliates\n3. Miss out on the consistent 4-point rewards from mutual cooperation\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Game theory suggests that in repeated games, maintaining cooperation once established is the most stable and beneficial strategy, as long as both players continue to cooperate.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk of getting only 1 point is now lower given the established pattern of cooperation. The expected value of choosing stag is higher based on the opponent's demonstrated behavior.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's maintain our stag strategy to continue the mutually beneficial cooperation pattern.\n\n[move] stag Maintaining cooperative strategy based on successful previous interaction.\n"
