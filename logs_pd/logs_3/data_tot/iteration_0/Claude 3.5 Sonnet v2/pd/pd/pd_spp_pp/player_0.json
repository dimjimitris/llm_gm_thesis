    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychologist - For understanding player behavior and decision-making\n3. Strategic Advisor - For integrating different perspectives and forming actionable plans\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic prisoner's dilemma scenario. The payoff matrix shows that while mutual cooperation (4,4) is better than mutual defection (2,2), there's always a temptation to defect for higher individual gain (6,1). Since this is a fresh player, we don't have any prior history to base our decision on.\n\nPsychologist: In initial interactions, players often start with cooperation as it builds trust and signals good intentions. Starting with defection might set a negative tone for future interactions if there are any. Research shows that cooperative opening moves often lead to better long-term outcomes in repeated games.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with both perspectives. Since this is a fresh player, starting with cooperation could:\n1. Signal our willingness to achieve mutual benefit\n2. Help establish a cooperative pattern\n3. Protect us from reputation damage\n4. Leave room for strategic adjustment in future rounds if needed\n\nGame Theorist: While there's risk of getting only 1 point if the opponent defects, the potential for establishing mutual cooperation (4 points each) is worth the risk compared to guaranteed mutual defection (2 points each).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate to signal trust and aim for mutual benefit.\n"

To potentially influence the opponent's future behavior\nIf they're using a sophisticated strategy, our defection might encourage them to switch to cooperation in subsequent rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Game theory suggests that allowing repeated exploitation without consequence often leads to continued exploitation. A defection here serves both as protection and as a teaching mechanism.\n\nPsychologist: This \"tit-for-tat\" response (responding to defection with defection) has been shown to be one of the most effective strategies in repeated prisoner's dilemma scenarios. It's clear, fair, and can lead to better cooperation in future rounds.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's proceed with defection.

If they maintain cooperation, we can establish the mutually beneficial (4,4) outcome\n2. We've already demonstrated we won't be continuously exploited\n3. This could lead to a stable cooperative pattern\n4. If they defect again, we can always return to defection\n\nGame Theorist: The potential payoff of mutual cooperation (4 points) outweighs the cautious approach of continued defection, especially since they've just shown willingness to cooperate.\n\nPsychologist: Returning to cooperation now also reinforces positive reciprocity - we're acknowledging their cooperative move and responding in kind, which could help establish trust.\n\n[move] (Reciprocating opponent's cooperation to encourage mutual benefit) cooperation\n"
