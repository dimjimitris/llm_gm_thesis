    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

They might be more likely to choose cooperatively (stag) to avoid the risk of the lower reward (2 points if both choose hare).\n\n4. **Decide on a Strategy:**\n   - Given the uncertainty but the potential for cooperation, choosing stag might be a safer bet as it can provide a moderate reward and signals a cooperative intent.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Stag (Choosing stag as a cooperative strategy to potentially get 4 points and signal cooperation with the fresh player.)\n"

This outcome suggests a cooperative strategy from the other player.\n\n3. **Assess the Other Player's Strategy:**\n   - The other player has consistently chosen stag, indicating a potential pattern of cooperative behavior.\n\n4. **Consider the Potential Outcomes for This Round:**\n   - If both players choose stag again: We both get 4 points.\n   - If both players choose hare: We both get 2 points.\n   - If I choose stag and the other chooses hare: I get 1 point, the other gets 6 points.\n   - If I choose hare and the other chooses stag: I get 6 points, the other gets 1 point.\n\n5. **Evaluate Strategic Options:**\n   - **Continue Cooperating (Stag):** Maintains stability and ensures a moderate reward (4 points) if the other player also chooses stag.\n   - **Switch to Competitive (Hare):** Could result in a higher reward (6 points) if the other player chooses stag, but is riskier if the other player also switches to hare, resulting in only 2 points for both.\n\n6. **Decide Based on Risk Tolerance and Previous Behavior:**\n   - Given the consistent cooperative choices of the other player, choosing stag again is likely the safer and more rewarding option.\n   - Choosing hare might yield a higher reward but comes with the risk of a lower reward if the other player also switches.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] Stag (Maintaining the cooperative strategy to potentially get 4 points and continue the trend established in the previous rounds.)\n"
