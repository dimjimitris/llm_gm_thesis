Let's think through this strategically.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoffs**:\n   - If both choose stag: Both get 4 points.\n   - If both choose hare: Both get 2 points.\n   - If you choose stag and the other chooses hare: You get 1 point, they get 6 points.\n   - If you choose hare and the other chooses stag: You get 6 points, they get 1 point.\n\n2. **Analyze the Risks**:\n   - Choosing stag is riskier if the other player chooses hare (you get 1 point).\n   - Choosing hare can be beneficial if the other player chooses stag (you get 6 points).\n\n3. **Consider Strategy**:\n   - If you believe the other player will choose stag, choosing hare gives you the highest points (6 points).\n   - If you believe the other player will choose hare, choosing stag minimizes your points (1 point).\n\n4. **Initial Move**:\n   - Since this is a fresh player and there's no history to analyze, starting with a safer move might be better. Choosing stag gives a decent reward if both choose stag (4 points), and if the other player chooses hare, you only lose slightly (1 point).\n\n### Final Decision:\nI'll start with stag to get a sense of the other player's strategy.\n\n**Move:**\n[move] (Choosing Stag initially to assess the opponent's strategy) Stag\n"
