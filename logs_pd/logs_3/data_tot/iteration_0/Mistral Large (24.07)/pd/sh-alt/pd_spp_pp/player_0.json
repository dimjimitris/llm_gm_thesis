    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The choice between stag and hare depends on your prediction of the other player's move. If the other player is likely to choose stag, choosing hare can give you 6 points, but if they choose hare, choosing stag can minimize your loss to 1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, this situation is similar to the Stag Hunt game. The key is to coordinate with the other player to maximize mutual benefit. If you can trust the other player to choose stag, both of you can gain 4 points each, which is a better outcome than both choosing hare and getting 2 points each.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given that the other player is fresh, they might not have a clear strategy and could choose either stag or hare. To maximize points while considering the risk, I will choose stag. This way, if the other player also chooses stag, we both get 4 points. If they choose hare, I minimize my loss to 1 point.\n\n[move] Choosing stag to maximize mutual benefit while minimizing risk.\n\nStrategy Expert: That's a reasonable choice given the uncertainty about the other player's move. Let's see how the other player responds in this round.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed.

The payoff matrix shows that both players have an incentive to coordinate on stag for mutual benefit (4 points each), but there's a risk if one player deviates to hare for higher individual gain (6 points).\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic stag hunt game in game theory. The challenge is to trust that the other player will also choose stag. If both players choose hare, they get a suboptimal but safe payoff (2 points each).\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given the game's structure, I need to consider the other player's likely move. If I trust the other player to also choose stag, we both benefit. However, if I'm uncertain, choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points.\n\nStrategy Expert: In the first round, it's often safer to assume the other player might be cautious and choose hare. You can adjust your strategy based on their move in subsequent rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Establishing trust and coordination is key in this game.

However, if I switch to stag and they continue with hare, I risk getting only 1 point.\n\nStrategy Expert: It might be worth taking a calculated risk this round. If you choose stag and the other player also switches to stag, you both get 4 points. If they stick with hare, you'll get 1 point, but you'll have more information for future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed.

The opponent's choice of stag indicates they might be prioritizing mutual cooperation.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given the opponent's choice of stag last round, it seems they are open to cooperative play. Choosing stag this round could build trust and lead to mutual benefit.\n\nStrategy Expert: If you choose stag and the opponent also chooses stag, you both get 4 points. This maintains the cooperative outcome and is a win-win situation.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Maintaining cooperation can lead to a sustained Nash equilibrium where both players benefit. However, be cautious of potential opportunistic behavior from the opponent.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the analysis, I will choose stag this round to signal cooperation and potentially maximize mutual benefit.\n\n[move] (Signaling cooperation and maximizing mutual benefit) stag\n\nFinish collaboration for this round!\n\nContinue with the game and collaboration as needed for future rounds.\n"

However, the opponent's choice of hare suggests they might be aiming for individual gain.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given the opponent's previous move (hare), it's likely they might choose hare again for higher individual gain. Choosing stag could risk another loss if they stick with hare.\n\nStrategy Expert: To hedge against potential losses, you might want to choose hare this round. If the opponent also chooses hare, you both get 2 points. If they switch to stag, you gain 6 points, which is a better outcome for you.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Choosing hare can either secure a safe outcome or exploit the opponent's potential switch to stag for a higher individual gain.
