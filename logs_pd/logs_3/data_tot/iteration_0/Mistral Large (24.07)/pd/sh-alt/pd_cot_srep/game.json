I need to consider the possible outcomes of my moves:\n   - If I choose stag and the other player also chooses stag, we both get 4 points.\n   - If I choose stag and the other player chooses hare, I get 1 point and they get 6 points.\n   - If I choose hare and the other player chooses stag, I get 6 points and they get 1 point.\n   - If I choose hare and the other player also chooses hare, we both get 2 points.\n\n2. Since this is the first round and I have no information about the other player's strategy, I should consider the risk and reward of each move.\n\n3. Choosing hare has a high reward if the other player chooses stag, but it's a risk because if they also choose hare, we both get fewer points than if we both chose stag.\n\n4. Choosing stag is safer because even if the other player chooses hare, I still get 1 point, and if they also choose stag, we both get a reasonable 4 points.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose stag for the first move to minimize risk and aim for a decent reward.\n\n[move] I choose stag to start safe and aim for a reasonable reward.\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
