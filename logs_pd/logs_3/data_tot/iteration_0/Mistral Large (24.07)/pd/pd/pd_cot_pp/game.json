Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

        "### Steps to Determine the Best Move:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix:**\n   - Both cooperate: You both get 4 points.\n   - Both defect: You both get 2 points.\n   - You cooperate, other defects: You get 1 point, other gets 6 points.\n   - You defect, other cooperates: You get 6 points, other gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Options in Your First Move:**\n   - Cooperating can either give you 4 points (if the other player also cooperates) or 1 point (if the other player defects).\n   - Defecting can either give you 6 points (if the other player cooperates) or 2 points (if the other player also defects).\n\n3. **Consider the Implications of Your Choice:**\n   - Defecting generally offers a higher reward, especially if the other player cooperates.\n   - However, if both players defect continuously, both will get relatively lower points (2 points each).\n\n4. **Strategy Formation:**\n   - If you anticipate the other player to cooperate initially, defecting will maximize your points.\n   - If future moves will be influenced by the current round (e.g., the other player may defect if you defect now), cooperation might be a safer long-term strategy.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that this is the first round and it's unclear how the other player will act, a strategic move might be to defect to maximize initial points.\n\n**[move] (To maximize initial points by assuming the other might cooperate) Defection**\n",

Understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: Both get 4 points.\n   - Both defect: Both get 2 points.\n   - You cooperate, other defects: You get 1 point, other gets 6 points.\n   - You defect, other cooperates: You get 6 points, other gets 1 point.\n\n2. Analyze the potential outcomes:\n   - Cooperating can lead to mutual benefit (4 points each) or a significant loss (1 point for you, 6 for the other).\n   - Defecting can lead to a moderate mutual outcome (2 points each) or a significant gain (6 points for you, 1 for the other).\n\n3. Consider the likelihood of the opponent's move:\n   - As this is a fresh player, their strategy is unknown.\n   - They might be likely to cooperate for mutual benefit, but there is no guarantee.\n\n4. Evaluate the risk and reward:\n   - Defecting has a higher potential reward (6 points) and a moderate fallback (2 points if both defect).\n   - Cooperating has a high risk of minimal reward (1 point if the other defects).\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] (To maximize potential points and reduce the risk of minimal reward) Defection\n"
