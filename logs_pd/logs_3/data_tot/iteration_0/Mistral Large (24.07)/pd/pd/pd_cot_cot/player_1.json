Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This sends a message of trustworthiness and potentially encourages the opponent to cooperate in future rounds.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n- **Cooperation** as the initial move incentivizes future cooperation and minimizes short-term risks.\n- **Defection** might maximize short-term gains but risks lower rewards in the long term.\n\n### Decision:\n\nStart with cooperation to test the waters and set a positive tone for the game.\n\n---\n\n**Move:**\n```\n[move] I choose cooperation to establish a cooperative baseline.\n```\n"

Risks a lower reward (2 points) if the opponent also defects.\n\n4. **Assess Risks:**\n   - **Cooperation** minimizes the downside risk (1 point) with a chance of a moderate reward.\n   - **Defection** maximizes potential gain but comes with the risk of a lower reward.\n\n5. **Decision Making:**\n   - Given no information about the opponent's past behavior, start with cooperation to encourage a cooperative dynamic and establish trust.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n**Move:**\n```\n[move] (Establishing a cooperative baseline) cooperation\n```\n"

Has potential for 6 points if the opponent continues to cooperate.\n   - **Switch to cooperation:** Encourages mutual cooperation, potentially leading to 4 points each. Risks minimal reward (1 point) if the opponent defects.\n\n5. **Decision Making:**\n   - The opponent's previous cooperation suggests they might be trying to establish a cooperative dynamic.\n   - Switching to cooperation could test this hypothesis and potentially lead to higher mutual rewards.\n   - For this round, I will choose cooperation to promote mutual benefit and see if the opponent is willing to cooperate.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n**Move:**\n```\n[move] (Testing the opponent's willingness to establish a cooperative dynamic) cooperation\n```\n"
