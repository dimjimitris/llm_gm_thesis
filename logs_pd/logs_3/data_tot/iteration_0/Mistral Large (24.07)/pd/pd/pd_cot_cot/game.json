Depending on the opponent's move, adjust your strategy.\n   - If the opponent cooperated, continue cooperating to maximize mutual gains.\n   - If the opponent defected, consider defecting in response to punish the defection.\n\n### Decision:\n[move] If the opponent cooperated, I will cooperate again. If the opponent defected, I will defect to punish the defection.\n\n---\n\n### Hypothetical Round 3\n\n1. **Analyze Past Behavior**:\n   - Continue to evaluate the opponent's moves and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n   - If the opponent has shown signs of cooperation, continue cooperating.\n   - If the opponent continues to defect, defection might be the optimal move to protect your points.\n\n### Decision:\n[move] If the opponent cooperated last round, I will cooperate again. If the opponent defected last round, I will defect again.\n\n---\n\n### General Strategy:\n\n1. **Initial Round(s)**: Start with cooperation to assess the opponent's behavior.\n2. **Subsequent Rounds**:\n   - Cooperate if the opponent cooperated.\n   - Defect if the opponent defected.\n3. **Long-term Consideration**: Maintain a balance between cooperation and defection based on the opponent's behavior to maximize points and minimize penalties.\n\n### Final Decision for Round 1:\n[move] Cooperation is the best initial move.\n"

Defecting could yield a higher reward if they cooperate, but cooperating ensures a stable reward if they also cooperate.\n\n### Final Decision:\nConsidering the fresh player, I will cooperate first to establish trust and gauge their strategy.\n\n**Move:**\n```\n[move] I choose to cooperate to build trust initially.\n```\n\nNow, let's see the outcome based on the opponent's move in the next round.\n"
