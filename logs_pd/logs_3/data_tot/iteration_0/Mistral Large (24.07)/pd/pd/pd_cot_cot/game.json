Evaluate the potential moves and their outcomes:\n   - Cooperating yields 4 points if the other player also cooperates, but only 1 point if they defect.\n   - Defecting yields at least 2 points and potentially 6 points if the other player cooperates.\n\n3. Consider the risks involved with each move:\n   - The risk of cooperating is high as it could yield minimal points if the other player defects.\n   - Defecting offers a safer minimum payoff and the possibility of a higher reward.\n\n4. Since this is the first round, there is no history to base the decision on. Therefore, a safer move would be to defect to minimize potential losses.\n\nFinal Decision:\n[move] (To minimize risk in the first round) Defection\n```\n",
