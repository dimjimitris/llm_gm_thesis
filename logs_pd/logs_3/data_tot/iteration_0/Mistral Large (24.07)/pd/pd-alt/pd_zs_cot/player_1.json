    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "Given the game description and the payoff matrix, here are the steps to reason through the first move:\n\n1. Understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Cooperate/Cooperate = 6 points each\n   - Defect/Defect = 2 points each\n   - Cooperate/Defect = 1 point for me, 4 points for the opponent\n   - Defect/Cooperate = 4 points for me, 1 point for the opponent\n\n2. Analyze the potential outcomes:\n   - If I cooperate, I could get either 6 points (if the opponent cooperates) or 1 point (if the opponent defects).\n   - If I defect, I could get either 2 points (if the opponent defects) or 4 points (if the opponent cooperates).\n\n3. Consider the opponent's perspective:\n   - The opponent faces the same choices and potential outcomes.\n   - A fresh player might be more likely to cooperate, as defecting requires a certain level of strategic thinking and understanding of the game's dynamics.\n\n4. Make a decision based on the above analysis:\n   - Cooperating could lead to a higher collective gain (6 points each) if the opponent also cooperates.\n   - Defecting could lead to a higher individual gain (4 points) if the opponent cooperates, but it could also lead to a less optimal outcome (2 points each) if the opponent defects as well.\n\n5. Since this is the first round and the opponent is a fresh player, I'll choose to cooperate to test the waters and potentially establish mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] I choose to cooperate to potentially maximize collective gain and test the opponent's strategy.
