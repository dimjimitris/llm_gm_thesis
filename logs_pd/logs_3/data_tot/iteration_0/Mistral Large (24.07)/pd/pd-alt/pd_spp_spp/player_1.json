    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The key to success here is understanding the payoff matrix and planning your moves accordingly. You aim to maximize your points while considering the potential moves of your opponent. What do you think about starting with a cooperative move to see how the opponent responds?\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: That's a good starting point. Cooperating initially can signal to the opponent that you are willing to collaborate, which might encourage them to cooperate as well. However, be prepared to adapt if the opponent chooses defection.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: [move] I will choose cooperation to signal a willingness to collaborate and observe the opponent's response.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Great, let's see how the opponent responds. Based on their move, we can adjust our strategy.\n\n**Strategist**: Agreed. If the opponent cooperates, we should continue to cooperate to maximize mutual benefits. If they defect, we may need to reconsider our strategy to either punish their defection oraintain our points.\n\n---\n\n[move] Cooperation (I will choose cooperation to signal a willingness to collaborate and observe the opponent's response.)\n\n---\n\nPlease provide the opponent's move before we proceed to the next round.\n"

This consistent cooperation indicates a strong likelihood that your opponent will continue to cooperate.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Indeed, repeated cooperative choices suggest a collaborative mindset. People tend to reciprocate cooperation when they perceive the other player is also cooperative. This makes it highly likely that your opponent will choose cooperation again.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the consistent cooperation in previous rounds and the analysis, it seems wise to continue with cooperation to maintain the cooperative dynamic and maximize mutual benefits.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: That's a sound approach. Continuing with cooperation reinforces the trust and cooperative relationship between you and your opponent. However, it\u2019s important to stay alert and adapt if the opponent switches to defection.\n\n**Strategist**: Agreed. Continued cooperation is the best strategy at this point. If the opponent defects, we can reassess our strategy for future rounds.\n\n---\n\n[move] (I will choose cooperation to maintain the cooperative dynamic and maximize mutual benefits.) cooperation\n"
