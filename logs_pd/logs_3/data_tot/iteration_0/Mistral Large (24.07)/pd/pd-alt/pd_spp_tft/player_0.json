    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The possible outcomes are as follows:\n- Cooperation + Cooperation: Both get 6 points.\n- Defection + Defection: Both get 2 points.\n- Cooperation + Defection: You get 1 point, other gets 4 points.\n- Defection + Cooperation: You get 4 points, other gets 1 point.\n\n**Game Strategist**: Since this is the first round and the other player is a fresh player, it's often beneficial to start with cooperation to establish a cooperative environment. This can signal to the other player that cooperation is the mutually beneficial strategy.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Cooperation does come with some risk. If the other player defects, you get only 1 point. However, cooperation has the highest potential reward if both players cooperate.\n\n**Psychologist**: Fresh players are often more likely to cooperate initially because they want to build trust. They might not want to seem uncooperative right from the start.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Thank you for your insights. Based on this, I will make the first move as cooperation.\n- [move] Cooperation.

If both cooperated, continue cooperating. If the other player defected, consider defecting in response.\n\n**Game Strategist**: If the other player cooperated in the first round, continuing to cooperate is the best strategy. It reinforces the behavior and maintains trust.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If the other player defected, defecting in response shows that you are not a pushover and might encourage the other player to cooperate in the future.\n\n**Psychologist**: Maintaining a cooperative stance can also encourage the other player to shift towards cooperation if they defected initially. It shows resilience in cooperation.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Considering the hints and insights:\n- If both cooperated: [move] Cooperation. Maintaining the cooperative strategy.\n- If the other player defected: [move] Defection.

Establishing a cooperative environment.\n- **Round 2**:\n  - If both cooperated: [move] Cooperation. Maintaining the cooperative strategy.\n  - If the other player defected: [move] Defection. Mirroring the other player's move to encourage future cooperation.\n\nBy following this strategy, we aim to maximize points through cooperation while being ready to respond to defection to ensure fair play.\n\n### Finish Collaboration\n\nFinal decision:\n- Round 1: [move] Cooperation. Establishing a cooperative environment.\n- Round 2:\n  - If both cooperated: [move] Cooperation. Maintaining the cooperative strategy.\n  - If the other player defected: [move] Defection.

If the other player defects, you get only 1 point. However, maintaining cooperation has the highest potential reward if both players continue to cooperate.\n\n**Psychologist**: Given that the other player cooperated in the last rounds, they are likely to continue cooperating to build trust. Defecting without provocation could break this trust and trigger a cycle of defection.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Thank you for your insights. Based on this, I will continue to cooperate to maintain the beneficial cooperative environment.\n- [move] (Maintaining the cooperative strategy to build trust and maximize points) cooperation\n"

Here are the personas we will collaborate with:\n\n1. **Game Strategist**: Provides insights into the best strategies for the game based on game theory and historical performance.\n2. **Risk Analyst**: Assesses the risks and potential outcomes of different moves.\n3. **Psychologist**: Helps understand the likely behavior of the other player based on psychological principles.\n\n### Starting Collaboration\n\n#### Round 11\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Let's discuss our move. The possible outcomes are as follows:\n- Cooperation + Cooperation: Both get 6 points.\n- Defection + Defection: Both get 2 points.\n- Cooperation + Defection: You get 1 point, other gets 4 points.\n- Defection + Cooperation: You get 4 points, other gets 1 point.\n\n**Game Strategist**: In the previous rounds, both players chose cooperation, resulting in 6 points each. This establishes a cooperative environment. Continuing to cooperate is beneficial to maintain this mutual trust.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Continuing to cooperate carries some risk. If the other player defects, you get only 1 point. However, maintaining cooperation has the highest potential reward if both players continue to cooperate.\n\n**Psychologist**: Given that the other player cooperated in the last rounds, they are likely to continue cooperating to build trust.
