Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: both get 6 points.\n   - Both defect: both get 2 points.\n   - One cooperates, one defects: the cooperator gets 1 point, the defector gets 4 points.\n\n2. Evaluate the choices:\n   - Cooperation yields a high mutual reward (6 points each) but comes with a risk if the other player defects (you get only 1 point).\n   - Defection ensures you get at least 2 points but has the potential to gain more (4 points) if the other player cooperates.\n\n3. Consider the opponent's likely strategy:\n   - Since it's a fresh player, it's uncertain whether they will cooperate or defect.\n\n4. Formulate a strategy:\n   - One effective strategy is to start with cooperation, as it can foster a mutually beneficial relationship.\n   - However, since the opponent is a fresh player with unknown tendencies, defection might be tempting to maximize points.\n\n5. Make the decision:\n   - Given the uncertainty and the payoff matrix, starting with cooperation might be risky because if the opponent defects, you get the minimum points (1 point).\n   - Defection, on the other hand, ensures at least 2 points and could yield 4 points if the opponent cooperates.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\n[move] Defect\n\nExplanation: Defection ensures a higher minimum reward (2 points), and if the other player cooperates, it maximizes your points to 4. This strategy reduces the risk of getting the minimum point reward in the first round.\n"
