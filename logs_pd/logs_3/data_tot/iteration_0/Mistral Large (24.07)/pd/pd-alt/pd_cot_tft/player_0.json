Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "To strategize for this game, let's break down the steps to identify the best move given the context that the opponent is a fresh player.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Construct the Payoff Matrix**:\n   Understanding the rewards for different move combinations can help guide the decision:\n   - Both cooperate: Both get 6 points.\n   - Both defect: Both get 2 points.\n   - You cooperate, opponent defects: You get 1 point, opponent gets 4 points.\n   - You defect, opponent cooperates: You get 4 points, opponent gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Consider Opponent Behavior**:\n   Since the opponent is a fresh player, there's a chance they might cooperate out of initial goodwill or lack of strategic thinking.\n\n3. **Evaluate Defection/Cooperation Outcomes**:\n   - If you defect and the opponent cooperates, you earn 4 points.\n   - If you cooperate and the opponent cooperates, you earn 6 points.\n   - If you defect and the opponent defects, you both earn 2 points.\n   - If you cooperate and the opponent defects, you earn 1 point.\n\n4. **Consider Risks and Rewards**:\n   - Defecting can yield high rewards if the opponent cooperates (4 points), but can be risky if the opponent also defects (2 points).\n   - Cooperating yields consistent rewards if the opponent also cooperates (6 points), but can result in a low payoff if the opponent defects (1 point).\n\n5. **Choose the Move**:\n   Given the uncertainty about the opponent's move, starting with cooperation could build trust and potentially maximize returns if the opponent also cooperates.\n\n### Move Message:\n\n[move] Cooperating to maximize gains if the opponent also cooperates. Cooperation\n\nFinal decision: [move] Cooperation\n"
