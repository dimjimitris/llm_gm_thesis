They might play randomly or cooperatively to start.\n\n4. **Decide on a Strategy**:\n   - Cooperating initially can set a cooperative tone which, if reciprocated, will yield a high mutual reward.\n   - Defecting might trigger a cycle of defection, leading to lower overall points for both players.\n\n5. **Make a Move**:\n   - Given the benefits of mutual cooperation and the potential to set a cooperative tone, I will choose to cooperate in the first round.\n\n[move] I choose cooperation to encourage a mutually beneficial cooperative strategy.\n"

They might not have a set strategy yet, but they're likely to try and maximize their own points.\n\n4. **Evaluate Strategies**:\n   - Always Cooperate: Could lead to a good mutual outcome (6 points each), but risks exploitation (1 point for me, 4 for them).\n   - Always Defect: Guarantees at least 2 points, and possibly 4 if the opponent cooperates, but could lead to mutual defection and a poor outcome for both.\n   - Tit for Tat: Start with cooperation, then mirror the opponent's last move. This can encourage cooperation but might be too passive initially.\n\n5. **Decide on the First Move**: Since the opponent is fresh, they might be more likely to cooperate initially. Therefore, cooperating first might set a cooperative tone for the game.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] I will choose cooperation to potentially set a cooperative tone for the game.\n\nLet's see how the other player responds.\n"
