But if we both choose Stag, we get a high reward (6 points).\n   - Choosing Hare is safer because even if the other player chooses Stag, I still get 4 points. But if we both choose Hare, the reward is low (2 points).\n\n3. **Consider the opponent's strategy**:\n   - Since the other player is new, they might play conservatively and choose Hare to avoid the risk of getting only 1 point.\n\n4. **Formulate a strategy**:\n   - Given the above analysis, I could start with Stag, hoping the other player plays it safe with Hare.
