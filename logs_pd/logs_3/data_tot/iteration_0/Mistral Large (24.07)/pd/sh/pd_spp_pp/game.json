The best outcomes are to either both choose stag for 6 points each or take advantage if the other player chooses hare. Choosing stag is riskier because if the other player chooses hare, you get only 1 point, but it could lead to higher rewards if coordinated correctly.\n\n**Economist**: In game theory, the Nash equilibrium for this scenario is when both players choose hare, as it minimizes the risk of getting the lowest score. However, if you can predict your opponent and coordinate, choosing stag might be beneficial.\n\n**Psychologist**: A fresh player might be risk-averse initially and choose hare to avoid the worst outcome. However, they might shift strategies if they see patterns in your moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the advice, my initial move will be to choose hare to minimize risk and observe the opponent's strategy.\n\n[move] Hare (Choosing hare to start cautiously and observe the opponent's move)\n\n---\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's move and any hints that may be provided before making the next decision.\n\n---\n\nContinuing the collaboration based on potential feedback or opponent's move.\n\n**Psychologist**: If the opponent chose hare, they are likely to continue with it. However, if they chose stag, they might be prone to risk-taking.\n\n**Game Strategist**: If the opponent chose hare in the first round, you might consider switching to stag in the next round to benefit from the higher points if the opponent continues with hare.\n\n**Economist**: The Nash equilibrium suggests sticking with hare to avoid the worst outcome. However, if you have reason to believe the opponent will stick with hare, switching to stag could maximize your points.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the opponent's previous move (assuming it was hare), I will switch to stag in the next round.\n\n[move] Stag (Switching to stag to potentially maximize points)\n\n---\n\nLet's observe the outcome of this move and adjust the strategy accordingly.\n\n---\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Adjust strategy based on opponent's moves and hints provided.\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
