He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player.

        "Let's analyze the game strategically to maximize points and minimize penalties. Here are the steps I will consider:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoffs**:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points.\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points.\n   - I choose stag, the other player chooses hare: I get 1 point, the other player gets 4 points.\n   - I choose hare, the other player chooses stag: I get 4 points, the other player gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Risks and Rewards**:\n   - Choosing stag is high risk, high reward. It can yield the highest joint reward (6 points) if both players choose stag, but it's risky because if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n   - Choosing hare is a safer strategy. It guarantees at least 2 points and can yield 4 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\n3. **Consider the Opponent's Potential Strategy**:\n   - The opponent might be risk-averse and choose hare to ensure at least 2 points, or they might be optimistic and choose stag hoping for 6 points.\n\n4. **Make a Decision**:\n   - Given the uncertainty about the opponent's move, opting for hare is a safer initial strategy. It guarantees a minimum of 2 points and potentially 4 points.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] (Choosing hare to guarantee at least 2 points and potentially gain 4 points if the other player chooses stag) hare\n",

This move provides the highest potential reward if the other player also cooperates.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] (Starting with cooperation to maximize mutual reward) stag\n"
