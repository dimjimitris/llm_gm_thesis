If both players choose hare, both get 2 points. This is a non-cooperative and low-reward outcome.\n3. If you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 point and the other player gets 4 points. This is a risky outcome where you are at a disadvantage.\n4. If you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 point. This is an opportunistic outcome where you gain at the expense of the other player.\n\nGiven that the other player is fresh and their strategy is unknown, a safe initial strategy would be to choose stag. This move encourages cooperation and has the potential for a high payoff if the other player also chooses stag. If the other player chooses hare, you'll receive fewer points, but this move will provide valuable information about the other player's strategy for future rounds.\n\n[move] I choose stag to encourage cooperation and maximize potential points.\n\nFinal decision: Stag\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

        "To determine the optimal move for the next round, let's think through the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Review Previous Round**: In the previous round, both players chose \"stag\" and both received 6 points. This indicates a cooperative strategy that resulted in a high reward.\n\n2. **Payoff Matrix Analysis**:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points.\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points.\n   - You choose stag, other chooses hare: You get 1 point, other gets 4 points.\n   - You choose hare, other chooses stag: You get 4 points, other gets 1 point.\n\n3. **Strategy Consideration**:\n   - Continuing with \"stag\" maintains the cooperative strategy and could lead to another round of high rewards (6 points each) if the other player also chooses \"stag.\"\n   - Switching to \"hare\" could yield 4 points if the other player chooses \"stag,\" but it risks getting only 2 points if both choose \"hare.\"\n\n4. **Risk and Reward**:\n   - Choosing \"stag\" is a safe and cooperative move with a potential high reward if both players continue to cooperate.\n   - Choosing \"hare\" introduces risk with potential for moderate gain but also the risk of a low reward.\n\nGiven the cooperative outcome of the previous round and the high potential reward for continued cooperation, it is strategically sound to maintain the cooperative strategy.\n\n[move] (Continuing the cooperative strategy to maximize points) stag\n"
