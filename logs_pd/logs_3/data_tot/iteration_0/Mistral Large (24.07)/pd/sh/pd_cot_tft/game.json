Choosing Stag might be risky if the opponent chooses Hare, which could result in a mere 1 point for me. However, since both players choosing Stag yields the highest payout, it's worth the risk to maximize potential points.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] (Choosing Stag to aim for the highest possible points of 6, balancing the risk of getting only 1 point if the opponent chooses Hare.)

Given the higher reward for mutual Stag, they might lean towards Stag.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Given the uncertainty, choosing Hare can guarantee a moderate gain while potentially exploiting the opponent if they choose Stag.\n\nFinal decision:\n```\n[move] Hare (Hare provides a safer minimum gain and potentially exploits the opponent if they choose Stag)\n```\n",
