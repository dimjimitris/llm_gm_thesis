Let me analyze the possible outcomes:\n\nIf both of us choose stag: we both get 6 points (best collaborative outcome)\nIf both choose hare: we both get 2 points\nIf I choose stag but opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4\nIf I choose hare but opponent chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1\n\nSince this is the first round with a new player, there's no history to base my decision on. The stag option gives the highest mutual benefit (6 points each) if we both choose it, but comes with risk if the opponent chooses hare. The hare option is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) but limits the maximum possible score.\n\nI'll go with the cooperative option that offers the highest mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing the cooperative option that maximizes our joint reward if we both cooperate.\n"
