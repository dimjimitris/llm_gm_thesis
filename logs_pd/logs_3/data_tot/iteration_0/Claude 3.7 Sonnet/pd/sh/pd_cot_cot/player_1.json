Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, they get 4\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4, they get 1\n\n2. This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare)\n\n3. The (stag, stag) outcome has the highest mutual benefit (6 points each)\n\n4. However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n\n5. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 4 points\n\n6. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, they may be inclined to choose the safer option (hare) or they might go for mutual cooperation (stag)\n\n7. The potential reward for mutual cooperation (6 points) significantly outweighs the safe option (2 points)\n\n8. I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, hoping to establish a pattern of cooperation\n\n9. If the other player also recognizes the mutual benefit of (stag, stag), we'll both maximize our points\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to aim for the optimal outcome.\n\n[move] stag\n"

This suggests the other player recognizes the value of cooperation and is willing to take the risk associated with choosing stag.\n\n3. Since we've established a successful pattern of cooperation, there's good reason to continue with the same strategy.\n\n4. The other player has demonstrated they understand the benefits of mutual cooperation over individual maximization.\n\n5. They could potentially switch to hare to try to exploit my stag choice (giving them 4 points and me only 1), but this would be short-sighted.\n\n6. If we maintain our stag choices, we both continue to earn the maximum possible mutual points (6 each).\n\n7. Switching to hare would potentially disrupt this cooperative equilibrium and lead to worse outcomes in future rounds.\n\n8. Given that we've established trust in the first round and both received the highest payoff, the most rational choice is to continue choosing stag.\n\n9.
