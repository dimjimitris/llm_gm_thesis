Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing the stag hunt game against a fresh player, which means I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n2. Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - If both choose stag: we both get 6 points (best collective outcome)\n   - If both choose hare: we both get 2 points (mediocre for both)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 points (worst for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 point (good for me, bad for them)\n\n3. The stag strategy is risky but has the highest mutual benefit (6 points). It requires cooperation and trust.\n\n4. The hare strategy is safer (guaranteed at least 2 points) but limits potential gain.\n\n5. Since this is the first round with a new player, they have no reason to distrust me yet. Cooperation might be possible.\n\n6. Starting with stag signals a willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, which could establish a positive pattern.\n\n7. However, if they choose hare while I choose stag, I'll be in the worst position (1 point).\n\n8. Given that this is a one-shot game with no established trust, and without knowing the other player's tendencies, I should balance risk and reward.\n\n9. The stag strategy has higher potential reward and signals cooperative intent, which may influence future rounds positively if we continue playing.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose stag to aim for the optimal mutual outcome.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing stag to aim for mutual benefit and optimal outcome for both of us.\n"

Continue with stag to maintain mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n   b. Switch to hare to exploit their potential cooperation (4 points for me, 1 for them)\n\n6.

However, exploiting their cooperation might cause them to switch to hare in future rounds, leading to worse outcomes for both of us.\n\n8. Since they've shown willingness to cooperate and we achieved the best mutual outcome, maintaining this cooperation seems most beneficial, especially if we'll continue playing more rounds.\n\n9.
