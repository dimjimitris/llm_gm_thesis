Both hare (2 points each)\n\nWe appear to be stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium of mutual hare choices (2 points each). Looking at our history, we've previously been able to break out of this pattern and establish productive cooperation after periods of mutual hare choices. However, my last attempt to return to cooperation after mutual hare (in round 12) was met with exploitation.\n\nAt this point, I need to consider whether it's worth taking another risk to potentially restore cooperation. After analyzing the pattern, I notice that in round 7, when I chose hare after being exploited and gained 4 points, we successfully returned to cooperation afterward.\n\nGiven this history and the potential reward:\n\n[move] stag\n\nI'm choosing stag as a calculated risk to attempt breaking out of our suboptimal equilibrium. While my opponent might exploit this move, the potential reward of returning to mutual cooperation (6 points each) outweighs the continued guaranteed but lower payoff (2 points each). The extended period of mutual hare choices may have indicated to my opponent that cooperation would be mutually beneficial. This move signals my willingness to trust again and potentially restore optimal outcomes for both of us.\n"

Both hare (2 points each)\n15. Both stag (6 points each)\n\nThis demonstrates that even after multiple rounds of mutual hare, cooperation can be re-established. My risk in choosing stag has paid off, and we're now back to the optimal outcome of 6 points each.\n\nGiven this successful return to cooperation and the clear mutual benefit:\n\n[move] stag\n\nI'm continuing with stag to maintain our renewed cooperation. The history of our game shows that despite occasional deviations, we can successfully return to and maintain cooperative outcomes. The significant difference between mutual stag (6 points each) and mutual hare (2 points each) makes continued cooperation the rational choice for both players. By maintaining stag, I'm signaling my commitment to sustaining this optimal equilibrium.\n"
