Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "I need to decide whether to choose \"stag\" or \"hare\" in this game. Let me think through this strategically.\n\nSteps:\n1. First, I'll analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each (total: 12)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (total: 4)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, they get 4\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4, they get 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where mutual cooperation (stag-stag) yields the highest collective and individual outcome.\n\n3. The stag-stag outcome (6,6) is Pareto optimal and risk-dominant.\n\n4. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't know their tendency toward cooperation or defection.\n\n5. If I believe the other player is rational and understands the game, they should prefer the stag option as well, since it can lead to the highest possible payoff.\n\n6. The risk in choosing stag is that if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n\n7. However, even if the other player chooses hare in this first round, selecting stag signals my willingness to cooperate, which might establish cooperation in future rounds.\n\n8. The potential gain from mutual cooperation (6 points) outweighs the safer but lower payoff from choosing hare (guaranteed minimum of 2 points).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to aim for the optimal outcome and signal cooperative intent.\n\n[move] stag - Choosing stag to aim for the optimal cooperative outcome of 6 points each.\n"

This suggests the other player understands the benefits of cooperation and is willing to choose the mutually beneficial option.\n\n3. Since the other player cooperated in the first round, there's a good indication they may continue this cooperative strategy.\n\n4. The payoff matrix still shows that mutual stag choice (6 points each) is significantly better than mutual hare choice (2 points each).\n\n5. If I were to switch to hare while they continue choosing stag, I would get 4 points instead of 6, and they would only get 1 point.\n\n6. This might prompt them to switch to hare in future rounds out of retaliation, leading to a worse outcome for both of us (2 points each).\n\n7. Since we've established a cooperative pattern in round 1, maintaining this cooperation is strategically advantageous.\n\n8. The expected value of continuing with stag (assuming the other player also continues with stag) is higher than switching to hare.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue choosing stag to maintain our mutually beneficial cooperation.\n\n[move] stag - Continuing with stag to maintain the cooperative equilibrium we established in the first round.\n"

Through twelve consecutive rounds, both the other player and I have consistently chosen \"stag,\" with each round yielding the optimal outcome of 6 points per player.\n\n2. This extended pattern of mutual cooperation has established an extremely robust and beneficial equilibrium that has maximized our scores consistently.\n\n3. The other player has demonstrated perfect consistency in their strategy, choosing stag in all twelve previous rounds without deviation.\n\n4. The payoff structure remains unchanged - mutual stag choice (6,6) continues to be the best possible outcome compared to all alternatives.\n\n5. With twelve rounds of consistent cooperative behavior, there is overwhelming evidence that the other player understands the game theory optimum and is fully committed to it.\n\n6. In repeated games with established patterns of mutual benefit, continuing the proven optimal strategy is the most rational approach.\n\n7. Analyzing alternatives:\n   - Choosing hare would reduce my immediate payoff from 6 to 4 points\n   - It would disrupt a perfectly functioning cooperative relationship that has benefited both players\n   - It would likely trigger a shift to less optimal outcomes in future rounds\n   - There's no strategic advantage to changing a strategy that has consistently maximized points\n\n8. The consistent history of mutual cooperation provides compelling evidence that continuing this strategy will yield the optimal outcome.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue choosing stag to maintain our optimal cooperative equilibrium.\n\n[move] stag - Maintaining our successful cooperative strategy that has consistently delivered the maximum possible points for both players across all twelve previous rounds.\n"
