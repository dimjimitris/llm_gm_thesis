The stag strategy is risky but has highest potential payoff (6 points).\n\n4. The hare strategy is safer (guaranteed at least 2 points) but limits maximum potential.\n\n5. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, there's no reason to believe they will defect.\n\n6. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n7. If we both choose stag, we both maximize our points (6 each).\n\n8. The risk is that if they choose hare while I choose stag, I only get 1 point.\n\n9.
