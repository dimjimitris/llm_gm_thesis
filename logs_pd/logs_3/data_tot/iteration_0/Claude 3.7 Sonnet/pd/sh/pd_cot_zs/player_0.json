He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" coordination game where mutual cooperation (stag-stag) yields the best collective outcome.\n\n3. The stag strategy is risky but has highest potential payoff (6 points).\n\n4. The hare strategy is safer (guaranteed at least 2 points) but limits maximum potential.\n\n5. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, there's no reason to believe they will defect.\n\n6. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n7. If we both choose stag, we both maximize our points (6 each).\n\n8. The risk is that if they choose hare while I choose stag, I only get 1 point.\n\n9. However, the potential reward of mutual stag selection outweighs this risk in the first round.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing stag to aim for the highest mutual benefit outcome.

The expected value analysis remains decisively in favor of stag:\n   - Continuing stag: 6 points expected (based on twelve rounds of consistent outcomes)\n   - Deviating now would sacrifice a proven optimal strategy with no rational justification\n\n6. In repeated games with this many iterations showing perfect consistency, the probability that both players will maintain the established pattern is extremely high.\n\n7.
