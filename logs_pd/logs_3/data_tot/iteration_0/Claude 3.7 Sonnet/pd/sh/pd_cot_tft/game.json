First, let me understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, they get 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, they get 2\n   - I choose stag, they choose hare: I get 1, they get 4\n   - I choose hare, they choose stag: I get 4, they get 1\n\n2. Evaluating the risk and reward of each option:\n   - Stag offers the highest potential payoff (6 points) but carries risk (only 1 point if the other player chooses hare)\n   - Hare guarantees at least 2 points, and potentially 4 points if the other player chooses stag\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player:\n   - I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies\n   - The cooperative equilibrium (both choosing stag) is the most beneficial for both players collectively\n   - A rational player might recognize this mutual benefit\n\n4. For the first move, I'll choose stag for these reasons:\n   - It signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n   - It establishes a precedent that could lead to continued cooperation\n   - The potential reward (6 points) outweighs the risk in my assessment\n\n[move] stag\n"

Testing my new hypothesis:\n   - If my \"opponent matches after repetition\" theory is true, then since I just played hare twice in a row (rounds 7-8), and they matched with hare in round 8, they might expect me to switch and counter that\n   - If I play stag now (switching from my previous move), they might play hare (countering)\n   - This would result in me getting only 1 point again\n\n5. Strategic evaluation:\n   - Hare has consistently been my better-performing move overall\n   - Even in the worst case when opponent also chooses hare, I still get 2 points\n   - The risk of getting only 1 point with stag remains high based on past patterns\n   - Given the uncertainty and the better minimum outcome, hare remains the safer choice\n\n6.

Risk assessment:\n   - Switching to stag is high-risk, high-reward (either 1 or 6 points)\n   - Continuing with hare is medium-risk, medium-reward (either 2 or 4 points)\n   - Given the opponent's pattern of choosing hare when I've been consistent, stag carries significant risk\n\n6.

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose stag, opponent chose hare. I got 1 point, they got 4.\n   - Round 2: I chose hare, opponent chose stag. I got 4 points, they got 1.\n   - Round 3: I chose stag, opponent chose hare. I got 1 point, they got 4.\n   - Round 4: I chose hare, opponent chose stag. I got 4 points, they got 1.\n   - Round 5: I chose hare, opponent chose hare. I got 2 points, they got 2.\n   - Round 6: I chose stag, opponent chose hare.

I got 2 points, they got 2.\n   - Round 9: I chose hare, opponent chose hare. I got 2 points, they got 2.\n   - Round 10: I chose stag, opponent chose hare. I got 1 point, they got 4.\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - My switch to stag in round 10 was met with hare from my opponent\n   - Every time I've played stag (rounds 1, 3, 6, 10), my opponent has played hare\n   - This pattern has been completely consistent across all rounds\n   - When I play hare, the opponent's response is more variable (stag in rounds 2, 4, 7; hare in rounds 5, 8, 9)\n\n3. Updated score statistics:\n   - Total score: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 22 points over 10 rounds\n   - Average of 2.2 points per round\n   - Playing hare has given me: 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 18 points in 6 rounds (3.0 avg)\n   - Playing stag has given me: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 points in 4 rounds (1.0 avg)\n\n4. Critical strategy assessment:\n   - My opponent appears to have a very consistent strategy against stag - they always play hare\n   - This makes playing stag consistently unprofitable for me (always resulting in 1 point)\n   - When I play hare, I've averaged 3 points per round, significantly better than the 1 point from stag\n\n5. Game theory analysis:\n   - My opponent seems to be exploiting my cooperative moves (stag) every time\n   - They may occasionally play stag when I play hare to tempt me back into playing stag\n   - However, they've shown they will immediately punish stag plays\n   - Given this consistent pattern, the rational move is to play hare\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - I'll return to playing hare based on the empirical evidence\n   - This has been my significantly better-performing move (3.0 vs 1.0 points on average)\n   - The opponent's consistent exploitation of my stag moves makes them too risky\n   - Even though hare-hare only yields 2 points, it's still better than the 1 point I get when playing stag\n\n[move] hare\n"

Pattern refinement:\n   - An interesting pattern is emerging more clearly: my opponent seems to play the opposite of my previous move\n   - When I played stag in round 10, they played stag in round 11\n   - When I played hare in rounds 7-9, they played hare in rounds 8-10\n   - This \"play opposite of opponent's last move\" strategy fits most rounds\n\n3. Updated score statistics:\n   - Total score: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 26 points over 11 rounds\n   - Average of 2.36 points per round\n   - Playing hare has given me: 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 22 points in 7 rounds (3.14 avg)\n   - Playing stag has given me: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 points in 4 rounds (1.0 avg)\n\n4. Strategic exploitation:\n   - If my opponent is indeed playing the opposite of my previous move, I can exploit this\n   - Since I just played hare in round 11, they would play hare in round 12\n   - Therefore, I should play hare to get 2 points instead of stag which would give me only 1 point\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing hare continues to be the safer option based on historical performance\n   - Even if my pattern recognition is incorrect, hare has yielded better results overall\n   - The worst I can get with hare is 2 points, versus 1 point with stag\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - I'll play hare again this round\n   - If my opponent follows the pattern of playing opposite to my previous move, they'll play hare\n   - This would result in both of us getting 2 points\n   - If they break the pattern and play stag, I'd get 4 points, which is even better\n\n[move] hare\n"

Pattern analysis update:\n   - My \"opponent plays opposite of my previous move\" theory doesn't fully hold\n   - Looking at the last few rounds:\n     * I played stag in round 10, they played stag in round 11 (matches theory)\n     * I played hare in round 11, they played hare in round 12 (matches theory)\n   - But earlier rounds don't consistently match this pattern\n\n3. Looking for clearer patterns:\n   - When I've played stag (rounds 1, 3, 6, 10), they've played hare 100% of the time\n   - When I've played hare (rounds 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12), they've played:\n     * Stag in rounds 2, 4, 7, 11 (after I played stag or after a streak of hare ended)\n     * Hare in rounds 5, 8, 9, 12 (continuing during my hare streaks)\n\n4. Updated score statistics:\n   - Total score: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 28 points over 12 rounds\n   - Average of 2.33 points per round\n   - Playing hare has given me: 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 24 points in 8 rounds (3.0 avg)\n   - Playing stag has given me: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 points in 4 rounds (1.0 avg)\n\n5. Strategic evaluation:\n   - Hare continues to be my significantly better-performing move\n   - The pattern suggests that my opponent plays stag after I switch from stag to hare\n   - Since I've now played hare twice in a row (rounds 11-12), they might continue with hare\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - I'll continue with hare for this round\n   - Even if they also play hare, I get 2 points, which is better than the consistent 1 point I've received when playing stag\n   - If they switch to stag, I'd get 4 points\n   - Maintaining consistency with my higher-performing strategy makes sense given the uncertainty about their exact pattern\n\n[move] hare\n"

Current score statistics:\n   - Total score: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 30 points over 13 rounds\n   - Average of 2.31 points per round\n   - Playing hare has given me: 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 26 points in 9 rounds (2.89 avg)\n   - Playing stag has given me: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 points in 4 rounds (1.0 avg)\n\n4. Strategic pattern testing:\n   - If I switch to stag now after playing hare for multiple rounds, would they continue their pattern?\n   - Based on previous rounds (1, 3, 6, 10), whenever I've played stag, they've played hare\n   - This has been the most consistent pattern throughout the entire game\n   - If this pattern holds, playing stag would only give me 1 point\n\n5. Considering optimal strategy:\n   - Hare continues to be my better-performing move overall\n   - If I play hare again, I'll likely get 2 points (if they play hare)\n   - If I play stag, I'll likely get 1 point (if they play hare, following their consistent pattern)\n   - The expected value of playing hare remains higher\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - I'll play hare again this round\n   - This remains my higher expected value play (average of 2.89 points versus 1.0)\n   - Even though we've been in a hare-hare pattern for a while, switching to stag is likely to result in an even lower score based on the opponent's consistent behavior\n   - Continuing with hare gives me either 2 or 4 points, both better than the expected 1 point from stag\n\n[move] hare\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - We are now in a streak of 4 consecutive rounds where both of us played hare (rounds 11-14)\n   - This suggests my opponent may have settled into a stable strategy\n   - Their most consistent pattern remains: they always play hare when I play stag (4/4 times)\n   - When I play hare after playing stag (rounds 2, 4, 7, 11), they've played stag 4/4 times\n   - When I play hare multiple times in a row, they typically play hare (in 7/9 instances)\n\n3.

Strategic considerations:\n   - We appear to be in a stable equilibrium of both playing hare\n   - This gives us both 2 points per round, which is suboptimal compared to both playing stag (6 points each)\n   - However, my attempts to play stag have consistently been exploited (resulting in 1 point)\n   - Breaking out of this equilibrium is risky without a credible way to coordinate\n\n5. Game theory analysis:\n   - The current hare-hare equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium - neither player has incentive to change unilaterally\n   - If I switch to stag but they continue with hare, I'd get only 1 point (worse than current 2 points)\n   - To achieve the cooperative stag-stag outcome would require coordination or trust that isn't present\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - I'll continue with hare for this round\n   - This maintains the current equilibrium that gives me 2 points per round\n   - While not optimal, it's significantly better than the 1 point I've consistently received when playing stag\n   - Given the opponent's consistent pattern of exploiting stag plays, hare remains my best response\n\n[move] hare\n"

Equilibrium analysis:\n   - The current hare-hare equilibrium (2 points each) is suboptimal compared to stag-stag (6 points each)\n   - However, the risk of switching to stag is high given opponent's history\n   - Every time I've played stag, I've received only 1 point\n   - Breaking from hare-hare requires one player to risk getting exploited\n\n5. Risk vs. reward calculation:\n   - If I play stag and opponent plays hare (likely based on history): I get 1 point (worse than current)\n   - If I play stag and opponent plays stag (unlikely based on history): I get 6 points (better than current)\n   - If I play hare and opponent plays hare (likely based on recent trend): I get 2 points (status quo)\n   - If I play hare and opponent plays stag (possible but less likely): I get 4 points (better than status quo)\n   - Expected value of stag is lower than hare given opponent's observed behavior\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - I'll continue with hare for this round\n   - We appear to be in a stable equilibrium that consistently delivers 2 points per round\n   - Given the opponent's demonstrated willingness to exploit stag plays, switching carries significant risk\n   - While a cooperative stag-stag outcome would be better, there's no indication the opponent is willing to cooperate\n\n[move] hare\n"

Since this is a fresh player with no history:\n   - There's no prior behavior to analyze\n   - The 'rational' choice for mutual benefit is stag\n   - However, choosing stag requires trust that the other player will also choose stag\n\n4. Decision factors:\n   - Stag is Pareto-optimal (best mutual outcome possible)\n   - Hare is risk-dominant (protects against worst-case scenario)\n   - In one-off games with strangers, cooperation can be risky\n\n5.

Evaluating the risk and reward of each option:\n   - Stag offers the highest potential payoff (6 points) but carries risk (only 1 point if the other player chooses hare)\n   - Hare guarantees at least 2 points, and potentially 4 points if the other player chooses stag\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player:\n   - I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies\n   - The cooperative equilibrium (both choosing stag) is the most beneficial for both players collectively\n   - A rational player might recognize this mutual benefit\n\n4. For the first move, I'll choose stag for these reasons:\n   - It signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n   - It establishes a precedent that could lead to continued cooperation\n   - The potential reward (6 points) outweighs the risk in my assessment\n\n[move] stag\n",

In round 1, I chose stag, but my opponent chose hare.\n   - I received only 1 point while they received 4 points\n   - This suggests my opponent prioritized their personal gain over mutual benefit\n\n2. Analyzing the previous outcome:\n   - My opponent has demonstrated they're willing to exploit cooperative behavior\n   - This could indicate they might follow the same strategy again, expecting me to continue choosing stag\n\n3. Considering my options for this round:\n   - If I choose stag again and they choose hare again, I'll get only 1 point again\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare, I'll get 2 points\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag, I'll get 4 points\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag, I'll get 6 points\n\n4. Weighing risk vs. reward:\n   - Based on their previous behavior, my opponent seems more likely to choose hare\n   - Choosing stag again carries significant risk with limited evidence my opponent will cooperate\n   - Choosing hare protects me from their exploitation and could potentially reward me more if they switch strategies\n\n5. For this round, I'll choose hare because:\n   - It protects against continued exploitation\n   - It communicates that non-cooperative behavior has consequences\n   - It offers a better expected value given my opponent's demonstrated behavior\n\n[move] hare\n",

Strategic assessment:\n   - My opponent has shown they're willing to exploit cooperation\n   - The probability they'll choose stag this round seems low based on their first move\n   - Protection against exploitation is now more important than attempting optimal cooperation\n\n5.

Evaluating possible strategies for this round:\n   - If they're truly alternating, they'll choose hare this round\n   - If they've switched to a cooperative strategy, they'll choose stag again\n   - If they're trying to be unpredictable, their move is harder to anticipate\n\n4. Weighing my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: we both get 6 points (optimal collective outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points (best individual outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: we both get 2 points (safe option)\n\n5. Making my decision:\n   - Since my opponent chose stag in the previous round, there's some indication they might be willing to cooperate\n   - However, based on the first round, they've shown they can be opportunistic\n   - The safer play is to choose hare, which guarantees at least 2 points\n   - I'll choose hare to protect myself while still potentially getting 4 points if they choose stag again\n\n[move] hare\n",

Analyzing outcomes by move choice:\n   - When I choose stag: I've received 1 point each time (3 instances)\n   - When I choose hare: I've received 4 points three times and 2 points once\n   - Hare has been significantly more profitable for me overall\n\n4. Identifying a possible meta-pattern:\n   - Looking at my opponent's last few moves: hare, hare, stag\n   - This could suggest they're returning to an alternating pattern\n   - If they're alternating, they might choose hare next\n   - However, their pattern has been inconsistent enough that this is uncertain\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (worst outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points (very good)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 points (mediocre)\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - Given my past success with choosing hare (average of 3.5 points per hare move)\n   - And the risk of getting only 1 point with stag (which has happened every time)\n   - I'll continue with the hare strategy for this round\n   - This provides a good balance of risk and reward based on the established pattern\n\n[move] hare\n",

Re-analyzing the opponent's pattern:\n   - Looking at their sequence of moves: hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, hare, stag\n   - There was an apparent alternating pattern (hare-stag-hare-stag) that broke at round 5\n   - Then it appears they may have returned to alternating from round 6 (hare-stag)\n\n3. Looking at my points by move type:\n   - When I choose stag: I've gotten 1 point each time (when opponent chose hare)\n   - When I choose hare: I've gotten either 4 points (when opponent chose stag) or 2 points (when both chose hare)\n   - Clearly, hare has been my more successful move overall\n\n4. Analyzing opponent's potential strategy:\n   - If they're back to a simple alternating pattern, they would choose hare next\n   - If they're responding to my moves with some strategy, it's still not entirely clear\n   - Their most recent move was stag, which might suggest they'll switch back to hare\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1 point (worst outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag, I get 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare, I get 2 points (moderate outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4 points (good outcome)\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - Given my success with choosing hare (average of 3.33 points when I choose hare vs. 1 point when I choose stag)\n   - And the prediction that they may choose hare next if they're alternating\n   - I'll choose hare again, which gives me either 2 points (if they choose hare) or 4 points (if they choose stag)\n   - This continues my risk-averse strategy while maintaining the possibility of a good payoff\n\n[move] hare\n",

Analyzing emerging patterns:\n   - Looking at rounds 2, 4, and 7, when I choose hare, my opponent has consistently chosen stag\n   - Looking at rounds 1, 3, and 6, when I choose stag, my opponent has consistently chosen hare\n   - Round 5 was the only exception where both of us chose hare\n\n3. Pattern hypothesis:\n   - My opponent seems to be playing a counter-strategy to my moves\n   - When I play stag, they play hare (to exploit me)\n   - When I play hare, they play stag (perhaps trying to encourage cooperation)\n   - This pattern has been more consistent than my previous \"copying\" theory\n\n4. Score analysis:\n   - My current total score: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 17 points over 7 rounds\n   - Average of approximately 2.43 points per round\n   - When I've played hare, I've averaged much better scores (4 points in 3 of 4 times)\n   - When I've played stag, I've consistently scored only 1 point\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If the counter-strategy pattern holds, playing hare will likely result in my opponent playing stag\n   - This would give me 4 points, which is an excellent outcome\n   - The empirical evidence strongly supports continuing with hare as my strategy\n   - There's little incentive to deviate from this strategy given the consistent pattern\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - Based on the established pattern and higher expected value, I'll choose hare again\n   - This has consistently yielded me 4 points when the pattern holds\n   - Even in the one case where the pattern didn't hold (Round 5), I still got 2 points, which is better than the 1 point I've received when playing stag\n\n[move] hare\n"

I got 4 points, they got 1.\n   - Round 3: I chose stag, opponent chose hare. I got 1 point, they got 4.\n   - Round 4: I chose hare, opponent chose stag.

Re-examining the pattern:\n   - My previous hypothesis about the counter-strategy has exceptions (rounds 5 and 8)\n   - Looking more carefully, there might be a different pattern:\n     * When I repeat the same move twice in a row (hare in rounds 4-5 and 7-8), the opponent seems to match my second move\n     * When I switch moves (as in rounds 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 6-7), they seem to counter my move\n\n3. Current score statistics:\n   - Total score: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 19 points over 8 rounds\n   - Average of 2.375 points per round\n   - Playing hare has given me: 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 16 points in 5 rounds (3.2 avg)\n   - Playing stag has given me: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 points in 3 rounds (1.0 avg)\n\n4. Testing my new hypothesis:\n   - If my \"opponent matches after repetition\" theory is true, then since I just played hare twice in a row (rounds 7-8), and they matched with hare in round 8, they might expect me to switch and counter that\n   - If I play stag now (switching from my previous move), they might play hare (countering)\n   - This would result in me getting only 1 point again\n\n5. Strategic evaluation:\n   - Hare has consistently been my better-performing move overall\n   - Even in the worst case when opponent also chooses hare, I still get 2 points\n   - The risk of getting only 1 point with stag remains high based on past patterns\n   - Given the uncertainty and the better minimum outcome, hare remains the safer choice\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - I'll choose hare again for this round\n   - This gives me a minimum of 2 points if they also choose hare\n   - It also tests whether my opponent truly has a pattern or if they're using a more complex or random strategy\n   - This helps manage risk while collecting more data on their behavior\n\n[move] hare\n",

I got 4 points, they got 1.\n   - Round 8: I chose hare, opponent chose hare. I got 2 points, they got 2.\n\n2. Reevaluating the pattern:\n   - My previous counter-strategy hypothesis doesn't fully explain Round 8\n   - Looking at the complete sequence, I notice:\n     * When I played hare twice in a row (Rounds 4-5 and 7-8), the opponent played stag then hare\n     * When I played stag after hare (Round 6), the opponent played hare\n   - This suggests a more complex pattern than simple countering\n\n3. Pattern hypothesis revision:\n   - My opponent may be using an alternating strategy with adaptations\n   - They seem to counter my move on some rounds but then adapt on others\n   - Rounds 5 and 8 both resulted in both of us playing hare, after I had played hare in the previous round\n   - This could indicate they switch to hare when I play hare repeatedly\n\n4. Score analysis:\n   - Current total: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 19 points over 8 rounds\n   - Average of approximately 2.38 points per round\n   - Playing hare has given me either 4 or 2 points (better than the 1 point from stag)\n   - After I play hare twice in a row, their pattern suggests they'll play stag again\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag, we both get 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get only 1 point (worst outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4 points\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare, I get 2 points\n   - Based on the observed pattern, after two consecutive hare moves (as in Round 8), they might switch strategies\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - I'll choose stag this time for several reasons:\n     * There's a chance they'll play stag after I played hare twice in a row\n     * If they do play stag, we both get the maximum 6 points\n     * This tests my hypothesis about their alternating/adaptive behavior\n     * If I'm wrong and they play hare, I only lose 1 point compared to playing hare (getting 1 vs 2)\n     * The potential upside (6 points) outweighs the downside risk\n\n[move] stag\n",

Reassessing the pattern:\n   - My previous pattern hypothesis is weakened by the results of Round 8\n   - When examining the sequence of my opponent's moves: hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, hare, stag, hare\n   - This suggests they might be using a more complex strategy, or adapting to my choices\n\n3. Looking for alternative patterns:\n   - One possibility is that my opponent anticipates my strategy and sometimes deviates to prevent me from exploiting a pattern\n   - Another possibility is they use a probabilistic strategy rather than a deterministic one\n   - It's also possible they're using a pattern based on both their past moves and mine\n\n4. Analyzing my scores by move choice:\n   - When I choose stag: 1, 1, 1 points (avg 1 point)\n   - When I choose hare: 4, 4, 2, 4, 2 points (avg 3.2 points)\n   - Clearly, hare has been significantly more profitable for me overall\n\n5.

Looking at multi-round patterns:\n   - Rounds 1-4 showed an alternating pattern from the opponent\n   - Rounds 5-9 show more hare choices from the opponent (4 out of 5 rounds)\n   - My consistent choice of hare in recent rounds may have influenced their strategy\n\n4.

Pattern analysis:\n   - A clearer pattern is emerging: when I choose stag (rounds 1, 3, 6, 10), my opponent always chooses hare\n   - When I choose hare, their response varies between stag and hare\n   - They seem to have a strong tendency to exploit my stag plays\n\n3. Updated score statistics:\n   - Total score: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 22 points over 10 rounds\n   - Average of 2.2 points per round\n   - Playing hare has given me: 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 18 points in 6 rounds (3.0 avg)\n   - Playing stag has given me: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 points in 4 rounds (1.0 avg)\n\n4. Opponent strategy analysis:\n   - My opponent appears to be consistently choosing hare when I play stag\n   - This suggests they're prioritizing their own gain (4 points) over mutual benefit (6 points)\n   - They're willing to play stag sometimes when I play hare, possibly to encourage me to play stag again\n   - This looks like a deliberate exploitation strategy rather than random play\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing stag has consistently resulted in me receiving only 1 point\n   - Playing hare has never resulted in me receiving less than 2 points\n   - The evidence strongly suggests that continuing to play stag is against my interests\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - Based on the established pattern and clear statistical evidence, I'll choose hare\n   - This gives me either 2 points (if opponent chooses hare) or 4 points (if opponent chooses stag)\n   - Both outcomes are better than the consistent 1 point I've received when playing stag\n   - While mutual cooperation would be ideal (both choosing stag), the opponent has shown no willingness to cooperate when I choose stag\n\n[move] hare\n",

Pattern analysis:\n   - Every time I've chosen stag (rounds 1, 3, 6, and now 10), my opponent has chosen hare\n   - This has resulted in me getting just 1 point in each of these rounds\n   - When I choose hare, I've gotten either 4 points (rounds 2, 4, 7) or 2 points (rounds 5, 8, 9)\n   - This suggests my opponent may have a simple strategy: counter stag with hare every time\n\n3.

Strategic evaluation:\n   - My attempts to play stag have consistently resulted in the worst payoff\n   - There's strong evidence that my opponent will continue to exploit stag plays with hare\n   - Hare has consistently given me better results (minimum 2 points, sometimes 4)\n   - Given the clear pattern of my opponent exploiting stag plays, continuing to play stag would be irrational\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing stag carries a very high risk of getting only 1 point based on historical evidence\n   - Playing hare guarantees at least 2 points, with a chance of 4 points\n   - The consistent exploitation of stag suggests my opponent is unlikely to change their strategy\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - I'll choose hare for this round\n   - The empirical evidence strongly supports this as my best move\n   - It provides the best expected value given the opponent's demonstrated behavior\n   - While this won't achieve the theoretical maximum of 6 points (mutual stag), it's the rational choice given the opponent's revealed strategy\n\n[move] hare\n"

Strategic planning:\n   - If my opponent is indeed playing \"opposite of my last move,\" then since I just played hare, they will likely play hare next\n   - If they play hare and I play stag, I'll get 1 point\n   - If they play hare and I play hare, I'll get 2 points\n   - The safer choice remains hare\n\n5. Long-term strategy consideration:\n   - If I stick with hare, I'll likely continue alternating between 2 and 4 points\n   - If I can somehow break this pattern and establish mutual stag play, we could both get 6 points consistently\n   - However, my attempts to play stag have consistently resulted in only 1 point\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - Based on the strong pattern and my opponent's predictable behavior, I'll choose hare again\n   - This should give me 2 points in this round (assuming they play hare as predicted)\n   - While not optimal, this is still better than the 1 point I would likely get from playing stag\n   - This continues my strategy of optimizing for expected value rather than taking risks\n\n[move] hare\n",

Strategic considerations:\n   - I just played hare and my opponent played stag, giving me 4 points\n   - Based on the historical pattern, if I play hare again, they might play hare (as happened in rounds 8-9)\n   - However, they've also sometimes continued with stag (rounds 4, 7) after a previous hare-stag round\n   - Playing stag is consistently punished with hare (1 point outcome)\n\n6.

Strategic considerations:\n   - Every time I've played consecutive hare moves, the opponent has played hare in response to the second one\n   - Every time I've switched from stag to hare, the opponent has played stag\n   - This suggests a pattern: they may be expecting me to play hare again and will respond with hare\n   - If I switch to stag now, there's a chance they might also play stag, yielding 6 points\n\n5.

Current score statistics:\n   - Total score: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 30 points over 13 rounds\n   - Average of 2.31 points per round\n   - Playing hare has given me: 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 26 points in 9 rounds (2.89 avg)\n   - Playing stag has given me: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 points in 4 rounds (1.0 avg)\n\n4. Strategic pattern testing:\n   - If I switch to stag now after playing hare for multiple rounds, would they continue their pattern?\n   - Based on previous rounds (1, 3, 6, 10), whenever I've played stag, they've played hare\n   - This has been the most consistent pattern throughout the entire game\n   - If this pattern holds, playing stag would only give me 1 point\n\n5. Considering optimal strategy:\n   - Hare continues to be my better-performing move overall\n   - If I play hare again, I'll likely get 2 points (if they play hare)\n   - If I play stag, I'll likely get 1 point (if they play hare, following their consistent pattern)\n   - The expected value of playing hare remains higher\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - I'll play hare again this round\n   - This remains my higher expected value play (average of 2.89 points versus 1.0)\n   - Even though we've been in a hare-hare pattern for a while, switching to stag is likely to result in an even lower score based on the opponent's consistent behavior\n   - Continuing with hare gives me either 2 or 4 points, both better than the expected 1 point from stag\n\n[move] hare\n",

I got 2 points, they got 2.\n   - Round 13: I chose hare, opponent chose hare. I got 2 points, they got 2.\n\n2. Pattern refinement:\n   - I've now played hare three times in a row (rounds 11-13)\n   - The opponent played stag in round 11, then hare in rounds 12 and 13\n   - This continues the pattern I observed earlier: when I play hare multiple times in a row, they switch to hare after initially playing stag\n   - Every time I've played stag, they've played hare (100% consistent)\n\n3. Updated score statistics:\n   - Total score: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 30 points over 13 rounds\n   - Average of 2.31 points per round\n   - Playing hare has given me: 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 26 points in 9 rounds (2.89 avg)\n   - Playing stag has given me: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 points in 4 rounds (1.0 avg)\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - I need to consider whether continuing with hare is optimal or if I should try to break the pattern\n   - After multiple consecutive hare plays from me, the opponent seems to settle into playing hare as well\n   - If I switch to stag now, based on past patterns, they will almost certainly play hare\n   - This would give me only 1 point, which is worse than the 2 points from hare-hare\n\n5. Pattern exploitation:\n   - The optimal moment to switch to stag would be after the opponent has just played stag\n   - If they continue their pattern of playing opposite my previous move, they might play stag after I play stag\n   - However, the historical data doesn't support this - they've always played hare after my stag moves\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - I'll continue with hare for this round\n   - The empirical evidence strongly supports this as the better strategy overall\n   - Even if we continue with hare-hare outcomes (2 points each), this is better than the consistent 1 point I get from playing stag\n   - The potential for a 4-point round still exists if they unexpectedly switch to stag\n\n[move] hare\n",

Refined pattern analysis:\n   - When I play stag, opponent always plays hare (4/4 times)\n   - When I play hare, their behavior has a pattern:\n     * After I switch from stag to hare (rounds 2, 4, 7, 11), they play stag\n     * During consecutive hare plays by me (rounds 5, 8, 9, 12, 13), they play hare\n   - This pattern has been extremely consistent\n\n3. Updated score statistics:\n   - Total score: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 30 points over 13 rounds\n   - Average of 2.31 points per round\n   - Playing hare has given me: 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 26 points in 9 rounds (2.89 avg)\n   - Playing stag has given me: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 points in 4 rounds (1.0 avg)\n\n4. Strategic exploitation opportunity:\n   - With the pattern now clear, I can try to exploit it\n   - If I switch to stag now, then back to hare in the next round, they should play stag in that round based on the pattern\n   - This would set me up for 4 points in round 15, though I'll likely get only 1 point in round 14\n   - This two-round strategy would average 2.5 points per round, which is better than continuing with hare (likely 2 points)\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - The pattern has been consistent enough to justify this strategic shift\n   - The downside is a guaranteed 1 point this round\n   - The upside is a highly likely 4 points next round\n   - This calculated risk makes mathematical sense given the observed pattern\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - I'll switch to stag this round\n   - While I expect to get only 1 point this round (as they'll play hare), this sets up a likely 4 points in the next round\n   - This is a strategic sacrifice for a greater overall gain\n   - This tests whether the identified pattern continues to hold\n\n[move] stag\n"

Strategic considerations:\n   - We appear to be in a stable equilibrium of both playing hare\n   - This gives us both 2 points per round, which is suboptimal compared to both playing stag (6 points each)\n   - However, my attempts to play stag have consistently been exploited (resulting in 1 point)\n   - Breaking out of this equilibrium is risky without a credible way to coordinate\n\n5. Game theory analysis:\n   - The current hare-hare equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium - neither player has incentive to change unilaterally\n   - If I switch to stag but they continue with hare, I'd get only 1 point (worse than current 2 points)\n   - To achieve the cooperative stag-stag outcome would require coordination or trust that isn't present\n\n6.

Stable pattern confirmation:\n   - We are now in a streak of 5 consecutive rounds where both played hare (rounds 11-15)\n   - This strongly indicates we've settled into a stable hare-hare equilibrium\n   - Key pattern insights from entire game:\n     * Opponent plays hare 100% of time when I play stag (4/4 instances)\n     * When I switch from stag to hare, opponent played stag 4/4 times\n     * In extended hare sequences, they predominantly play hare (8/10 instances)\n\n3. Updated score statistics:\n   - Total score: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 34 points over 15 rounds\n   - Average of 2.27 points per round\n   - Playing hare has given me: 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 30 points in 11 rounds (2.73 avg)\n   - Playing stag has given me: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 points in 4 rounds (1.0 avg)\n\n4. Equilibrium analysis:\n   - The current hare-hare equilibrium (2 points each) is suboptimal compared to stag-stag (6 points each)\n   - However, the risk of switching to stag is high given opponent's history\n   - Every time I've played stag, I've received only 1 point\n   - Breaking from hare-hare requires one player to risk getting exploited\n\n5. Risk vs. reward calculation:\n   - If I play stag and opponent plays hare (likely based on history): I get 1 point (worse than current)\n   - If I play stag and opponent plays stag (unlikely based on history): I get 6 points (better than current)\n   - If I play hare and opponent plays hare (likely based on recent trend): I get 2 points (status quo)\n   - If I play hare and opponent plays stag (possible but less likely): I get 4 points (better than status quo)\n   - Expected value of stag is lower than hare given opponent's observed behavior\n\n6. Making my decision:\n   - I'll continue with hare for this round\n   - We appear to be in a stable equilibrium that consistently delivers 2 points per round\n   - Given the opponent's demonstrated willingness to exploit stag plays, switching carries significant risk\n   - While a cooperative stag-stag outcome would be better, there's no indication the opponent is willing to cooperate\n\n[move] hare\n"
