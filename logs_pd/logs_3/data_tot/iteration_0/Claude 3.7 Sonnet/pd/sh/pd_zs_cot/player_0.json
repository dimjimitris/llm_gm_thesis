The stag strategy has the highest potential reward but requires mutual trust. The hare strategy is safer but limits potential gains.\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing stag because it offers the potential for the highest mutual benefit (6 points each). While it's riskier than choosing hare, I believe cooperation can lead to better outcomes for both of us, and I'd like to establish a cooperative relationship from the start.\n"
