Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" coordination game where mutual cooperation (stag-stag) yields the best collective outcome.\n\n3. If we both choose stag, we both maximize our points (6 each).\n\n4. However, choosing stag has risk - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n\n5. Choosing hare is safer - I get either 2 points (if they choose hare) or 4 points (if they choose stag).\n\n6. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, there's no history to base decisions on.\n\n7. The collectively optimal choice is stag, and many players recognize this and will choose it in the first round to establish cooperation.\n\n8. I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing stag to establish mutual cooperation for our highest possible joint reward.\n"

Extended cooperation analysis:\n   - Ten consecutive rounds of identical choices represents extremely strong strategic alignment\n   - The other player has demonstrated complete consistency in their decision-making\n   - Our mutual trust has been reinforced through multiple iterations\n   - The pattern has become so established that it would be highly unexpected for either player to deviate\n\n4. Game theory for repeated interactions:\n   - In extended iterated games, cooperative equilibria become increasingly stable over time\n   - After 10 successful rounds, our cooperation appears to be at maximum stability\n   - The rational strategy in such situations is to continue the established pattern\n   - Any deviation would likely produce worse outcomes for both players\n\n5. Expected value assessment:\n   - Continuing stag choice: Expected 6 points (based on consistent history)\n   - Switching to hare: Potentially 4 points once, followed by likely breakdown in cooperation and lower future returns\n   - The cumulative expected value heavily favors maintaining cooperation\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Ten rounds of consistent behavior establishes an extremely strong precedent\n   - No information suggests any advantage to changing strategy\n   - The optimal mutual outcome continues to be achieved\n   - Disrupting this equilibrium would be contrary to rational self-interest\n\n7. Decision analysis conclusion:\n   - The clearly optimal choice remains choosing stag\n   - Continuing our established pattern maximizes expected utility\n\n8.
