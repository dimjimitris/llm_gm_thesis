He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

Looking at broader patterns:\n   - My opponent has always defected when I cooperate (3 out of 3 times)\n   - My opponent has cooperated 3 times and defected 3 times when I defect\n\n4. In the most recent trend, my opponent has defected in the last two rounds.\n\n5. This could indicate they've shifted to a more defensive strategy or they might be using a more complex pattern I haven't fully identified yet.\n\n6. If I cooperate:\n   - Based on history, they'll likely defect, giving me 1 point\n   - If they break their pattern and cooperate, we both get 6 points\n\n7. If I defect:\n   - If they continue their recent pattern of defection, I get 2 points\n   - If they return to cooperating (as they did in rounds 2, 4, 7), I get 4 points\n\n8. Given that they've never cooperated when I cooperate, the expected value of cooperation is low.\n\n9. Defecting has historically given me better outcomes (average of about 3 points) compared to cooperating (always 1 point).\n\n10. While there's uncertainty in their current strategy, defection remains the safer choice based on the complete history of our interactions.\n\n[move] (Based on the opponent's consistent exploitation of cooperation and uncertain but better average returns from defection) defection\n"

The most recent trend (last 3 rounds) shows consistent mutual defection.\n\n5. This suggests my opponent may have settled into a defection strategy regardless of my moves.\n\n6. If this is true, my best response would be to also defect, guaranteeing 2 points instead of 1.\n\n7. However, there's also the possibility that my opponent is using a more complex strategy or adapting to my frequent defection.\n\n8. They might be looking for a signal to break the cycle of mutual defection.\n\n9. If I cooperate and they continue to defect, I only lose 1 point compared to mutual defection.\n\n10. But if I cooperate and they also cooperate, we both gain significantly (6 points each).\n\n11. Given the current streak of mutual defection, taking a calculated risk to potentially break this cycle might be worthwhile, especially considering we've been stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium for the past three rounds.\n\n[move] (Taking a calculated risk to break the cycle of mutual defection) cooperation\n"

This suggests that when I switch from cooperation to defection, my opponent cooperates in the following round.\n\n4. This appears to be a consistent pattern throughout our game.\n\n5. Additionally, I've noticed that my opponent has never cooperated when I cooperate (0 out of 4 times).\n\n6. Based on the current sequence, I just defected and my opponent cooperated.\n\n7. If I cooperate now, based on all previous history, they're very likely to defect, giving me only 1 point.\n\n8.

Looking more carefully:\n   - After I cooperate and they defect, if I defect in the next round, they reliably cooperate (rounds 2, 4, 7, 12)\n   - When I defect multiple rounds in a row, they tend to defect (rounds 5, 8, 9, 10, 13)\n   - They have never cooperated when I cooperate (0 out of 4 attempts)\n\n3. In the most recent rounds, I defected twice in a row (rounds 12-13), and they went from cooperation to defection.\n\n4. If I cooperate now:\n   - Based on history, they will likely defect, giving me 1 point\n   - But it would set up the pattern where they might cooperate in the next round if I defect\n\n5. If I defect now:\n   - They're likely to continue defecting, giving me 2 points\n   - This continues the mutual defection cycle\n\n6. I note that after sequences of mutual defection in the past, my cooperation attempt in round 11 did not break the cycle - they still defected.\n\n7. The only reliable way I've received 4 points is by defecting after I've cooperated.\n\n8. Given that we're in a continuous game, I could try cooperation now, accepting the likely 1 point in this round, to potentially set up for 4 points in the next round.\n\n9. This would require a longer-term strategic view rather than maximizing points in just this round.\n\n10. However, I need to balance risk and reward. Cooperating has consistently resulted in exploitation, while defecting gives me at least 2 points with potential for 4 points at times.\n\n[move] (Taking a calculated risk to potentially break the cycle and set up a more favorable situation for future rounds) cooperation\n"
