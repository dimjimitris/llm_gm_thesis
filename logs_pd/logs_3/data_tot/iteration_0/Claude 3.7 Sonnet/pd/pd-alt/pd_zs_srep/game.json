After their second cooperation in round 12, they've returned to defection for two consecutive rounds.\n\nThis reinforces their predominant strategy of defection. The periodic cooperations (at rounds 8 and 12) might suggest a pattern where they cooperate every 4 rounds, but given their history of exploiting my cooperation and their overall preference for defection, this is more likely tactical than a genuine shift in strategy.\n\nThe most reliable strategy against this opponent continues to be defection, which guarantees me 2 points per round instead of risking exploitation for 1 point.\n\n[move] (Continuing defection against an opponent with a strong and consistent defection strategy) defection",

Their only cooperations were in rounds 8 and 12, suggesting a possible pattern of cooperation every 4 rounds. If this pattern holds, they might cooperate in round 16.\n\nHowever, their overwhelming tendency to defect (13/15 rounds = 87% defection rate) and their previous exploitation of my cooperation suggest this pattern is more likely tactical than a genuine attempt to establish cooperation.\n\nEven if they do cooperate in round 16 following the potential 4-round pattern, responding with cooperation would expose me to exploitation as happened after round 8. Given their demonstrated behavior, defection remains the most reliable strategy to ensure I receive at least 2 points rather than risking 1 point.\n\n[move] (Maintaining defection against an opponent with a strong history of defection and exploitation) defection",
