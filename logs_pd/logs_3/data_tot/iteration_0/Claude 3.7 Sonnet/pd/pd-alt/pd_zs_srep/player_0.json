This creates a pattern worth noting - they cooperated in rounds 8 and 12. This could suggest they might be attempting a cyclical strategy or testing if I'll switch to cooperation after they cooperate.\n\nHowever, their previous behavior suggests caution is warranted. When I cooperated after their first cooperation, they immediately defected to exploit me. Given that they've defected in 10 out of 12 rounds and previously exploited my cooperation, I'm still inclined to believe they're attempting to manipulate rather than establish mutual cooperation.\n\nI'll continue with defection this round.\n\n[move] (Continuing defection given my opponent's history of exploitation and predominantly defecting strategy) defection"

Their behavior does not indicate a genuine attempt to establish mutual cooperation.\n\nGiven this consistent pattern and their demonstrated willingness to exploit cooperation, I'll maintain my defection strategy.\n\n[move] (Maintaining defection against an opponent who has defected in 11 of 13 rounds and has shown a pattern of exploitation) defection"
