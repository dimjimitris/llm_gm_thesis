This interesting pattern suggests the opponent might be employing a strategy where they alternate moves or possibly responding to my previous moves.\n\n4. The opponent cooperated in round 2 after defecting in round 1. This could mean:\n   - They might be using an alternating strategy (defect-cooperate-defect)\n   - They might be trying to establish mutual cooperation\n   - They might be using a strategy like \"tit-for-tat\" but with one round delay\n\n5.

Since I can't be certain of their strategy yet, and considering they just cooperated after I defected, cooperating now could test if they're willing to establish mutual cooperation for higher joint payoffs.\n\n7.

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I cooperated, opponent defected (1 point)\n   - Round 2: I defected, opponent cooperated (4 points)\n   - Round 3: I cooperated, opponent defected (1 point)\n   - Round 4: I defected, opponent cooperated (4 points)\n   - Round 5: I defected, opponent defected (2 points)\n   - Round 6: I cooperated, opponent cooperated (6 points)\n   - Round 7: I cooperated, opponent defected (1 point)\n   - Round 8: I defected, opponent cooperated (4 points)\n   - Round 9: I defected, opponent defected (2 points)\n   - Round 10: I cooperated, opponent cooperated (6 points)\n   - Round 11: I cooperated, opponent defected (1 point)\n\n2. A clearer pattern is emerging about my opponent's strategy:\n   - They appear to cooperate exactly once after I switch from defection to cooperation (rounds 6, 10)\n   - They consistently defect when I cooperate twice in a row (rounds 7, 11)\n   - After I defect twice in a row, they defect (rounds 5, 9)\n   - After I switch from cooperation to defection, they cooperate (rounds 2, 4, 8)\n\n3. This suggests my opponent is using a complex conditional strategy rather than a simple tit-for-tat or random approach.\n\n4. Based on the established pattern, if I defect now (after cooperating in round 11), my opponent is likely to cooperate as they did in rounds 2, 4, and 8.\n\n5. The pattern shows that attempting sustained mutual cooperation is not viable with this opponent - they exploit consecutive cooperation.\n\n6. My average points by move type:\n   - When I cooperate: 2.0 points per round (10 points over 5 rounds)\n   - When I defect: 3.2 points per round (16 points over 5 rounds)\n\n7. Given the opponent's demonstrated pattern and the point calculations, the rational move is to defect, which is likely to yield 4 points based on their previous behavior after I switch strategies.\n\n[move] (Switching to defection based on opponent's pattern of exploiting consecutive cooperation) defection\n"

The pattern in my opponent's behavior has remained consistent:\n   - Every time I switch from cooperation to defection, they cooperate (rounds 2, 4, 8, 12)\n   - When I cooperate after defection, they sometimes cooperate (rounds 6, 10) and sometimes defect (round 3)\n   - After consecutive cooperations from me, they defect (rounds 7, 11)\n   - After consecutive defections from me, they defect (rounds 5, 9)\n\n3. My current situation is that I've just defected, and they've cooperated.\n\n4. If I defect again now, based on rounds 5 and 9, they'll likely defect in the next round.\n\n5. If I cooperate now, based on rounds 6 and 10, there's a good chance they'll cooperate, which would give us both 6 points.\n\n6. However, I've noted in my previous analysis that my average points from defection (now 3.33 points) exceed those from cooperation (2.0 points).\n\n7. Since my goal is to maximize my points, and the pattern suggests they'll cooperate if I switch from defection to cooperation, cooperating now seems like the best strategy to attempt to get 6 points from mutual cooperation.\n\n8. This approach follows an alternating strategy that could maximize my points by getting 4 points when I defect and 6 points when we both cooperate, rather than getting stuck in mutual defection (2 points each).\n\n[move] (Switching to cooperation based on the pattern that opponent tends to cooperate after I switch from defection) cooperation\n"

My previous pattern analysis needs revision. Looking at rounds 3, 13, and comparing with rounds 6, 10:\n   - In rounds 3 and 13, I cooperated after defecting, and opponent defected\n   - In rounds 6 and 10, I also cooperated after defecting, but opponent cooperated\n\n3. This suggests there might be additional factors in their decision-making that I haven't identified, or there could be some randomness in their strategy.\n\n4. What remains clear from the data:\n   - Every time I switch from cooperation to defection, they cooperate (rounds 2, 4, 8, 12)\n   - When I cooperate consecutively, they always defect in the second round (rounds 7, 11)\n   - After two consecutive defections from me, they defect (rounds 5, 9)\n\n5. My point totals by strategy:\n   - Cooperation: 15 points over 7 rounds = 2.14 points/round\n   - Defection: 20 points over 6 rounds = 3.33 points/round\n\n6. The most reliable pattern is that when I switch from cooperation to defection, they cooperate, giving me 4 points.\n\n7. Given the opponent's behavior pattern and the consistently better outcomes from defection, I should defect this round.

The most reliable pattern continues to be:\n   - Every time I switch from cooperation to defection, they cooperate (rounds 2, 4, 8, 12, 14)\n   - After I defect twice in a row, they defect (rounds 5, 9)\n\n3. The pattern regarding my switch from defection to cooperation is less reliable:\n   - In rounds 6 and 10, they cooperated when I switched to cooperation\n   - In rounds 3 and 13, they defected when I switched to cooperation\n\n4. My current situation is that I've just defected, and they cooperated.\n\n5. If I defect again now, based on rounds 5 and 9, there's a high probability they'll defect, resulting in 2 points for me.\n\n6. If I cooperate now, based on the mixed results in rounds 3, 6, 10, and 13, the outcome is less predictable. There's roughly a 50% chance they'll cooperate (6 points) and 50% chance they'll defect (1 point).\n\n7. Expected value calculation:\n   - Defection: ~2 points (if pattern holds)\n   - Cooperation: 0.5 \u00d7 6 + 0.5 \u00d7 1 = 3.5 points (based on past behavior)\n\n8. While defection has yielded higher average points overall (3.33 vs 2.14), in this specific situation following a defection-cooperation sequence, the expected value of cooperation is higher.\n\n9. Additionally, avoiding consecutive defections prevents the likely mutual defection outcome in the next round.\n\n[move] (Switching to cooperation based on expected value analysis after the defection-cooperation sequence) cooperation\n"

I need to refine my understanding of the opponent's pattern.

The pattern is now clearer - my opponent tends to defect when I switch from defection to cooperation (3 out of 5 times). This revises my previous assessment.\n\n4. The most reliable patterns are:\n   - When I switch from cooperation to defection, they always cooperate (5/5 times)\n   - When I defect twice in a row, they always defect (2/2 times)\n\n5. My updated point totals by strategy:\n   - Cooperation: 16 points over 8 rounds = 2.0 points/round\n   - Defection: 24 points over 7 rounds = 3.43 points/round\n\n6. The most profitable strategy continues to be defection, particularly when switching from cooperation to defection.\n\n7. Given the current state (I just cooperated and they defected), if I switch to defection now, based on the consistent pattern in rounds 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, they will very likely cooperate, yielding 4 points for me.\n\n8.

In such situations, starting with cooperation often establishes a cooperative norm that can lead to mutual benefit (6 points each).\n\n4. If I defect and they cooperate, I'd get 4 points, but this might encourage them to defect in future rounds, leading to a worse outcome (2 points each) over time.\n\n5. If I cooperate and they defect, I'd get only 1 point, which is suboptimal. However, this risk seems worth taking to potentially establish mutual cooperation.\n\n6. The highest mutual benefit comes from both of us cooperating (6 points each), making cooperation the move with the best potential long-term outcome.\n\n7.

This is the first round, so I have no history with this player.\n4. In terms of maximizing points:\n   - Best joint outcome is mutual cooperation (12 total points)\n   - Defecting while they cooperate gives me highest individual points (4)\n   - But if both defect, we both get less (2 each) than if we both cooperate (6 each)\n5. Since this is the first round, I'll establish goodwill by cooperating, which could lead to a cooperative relationship that maximizes points over time.\n6. If they also cooperate, we both get 6 points, which is better than the 2 points from mutual defection.\n7.

If they're expecting me to cooperate now (since my pattern was alternating for rounds 1-4), they might defect to exploit me.\n\n7. However, if they're returning to their original strategy of doing the opposite of my move, they might cooperate since I defected last round.\n\n8.

The pattern has become more consistent and clear:\n   - Every time I switch from cooperation to defection, they cooperate (rounds 2, 4, 8, 12, 14)\n   - After consecutive defections from me, they defect (rounds 5, 9)\n   - Their response when I cooperate after defection is mixed (cooperation in rounds 6, 10; defection in rounds 3, 13)\n\n3. My current position is having just defected, with my opponent cooperating.\n\n4. If I defect again, based on rounds 5 and 9, they'll likely defect, resulting in 2 points.\n   If I cooperate now, based on the mixed patterns in rounds 3, 6, 10, 13, it's harder to predict their response.\n\n5. Point calculations:\n   - Defection has given me 24 points over 7 rounds = 3.43 points/round\n   - Cooperation has given me 15 points over 7 rounds = 2.14 points/round\n\n6. Looking at specific scenarios:\n   - After switching from defection to cooperation, I've received: 1, 6, 6, 1 points (average: 3.5)\n   - Defecting after defection has given me: 2, 2 points (average: 2)\n\n7. While consecutive defections typically lead to mutual defection (2 points), switching to cooperation now presents a mixed expected value (potentially 6 or 1).\n\n8. Given that switching from defection to cooperation has a higher expected value than consecutive defection, and I've already secured several high-scoring rounds with defection, I'll try cooperation to potentially achieve mutual cooperation again.\n\n[move] (Switching to cooperation to possibly achieve mutual cooperation based on mixed pattern analysis) cooperation\n",

The most reliable pattern continues to be:\n   - Every time I switch from cooperation to defection, they cooperate (rounds 2, 4, 8, 12, 14)\n   - After I defect twice in a row, they defect (rounds 5, 9)\n\n3. The pattern regarding my switch from defection to cooperation is less reliable:\n   - In rounds 6 and 10, they cooperated when I switched to cooperation\n   - In rounds 3 and 13, they defected when I switched to cooperation\n\n4. My current situation is that I've just defected, and they cooperated.\n\n5. If I defect again now, based on rounds 5 and 9, there's a high probability they'll defect, resulting in 2 points for me.\n\n6. If I cooperate now, based on the mixed results in rounds 3, 6, 10, and 13, the outcome is less predictable. There's roughly a 50% chance they'll cooperate (6 points) and 50% chance they'll defect (1 point).\n\n7. Expected value calculation:\n   - Defection: ~2 points (if pattern holds)\n   - Cooperation: 0.5 \u00d7 6 + 0.5 \u00d7 1 = 3.5 points (based on past behavior)\n\n8. While defection has yielded higher average points overall (3.33 vs 2.14), in this specific situation following a defection-cooperation sequence, the expected value of cooperation is higher.\n\n9. Additionally, avoiding consecutive defections prevents the likely mutual defection outcome in the next round.\n\n[move] (Switching to cooperation based on expected value analysis after the defection-cooperation sequence) cooperation\n"

My pattern analysis needs further updating. Looking at rounds 3, 13, 15 compared with rounds 6, 10:\n   - When I cooperate after defecting: 3 times they defected (rounds 3, 13, 15) and 2 times they cooperated (rounds 6, 10)\n   - The pattern I previously thought might exist is now less likely\n\n3. The most reliable patterns remain:\n   - Every time I switch from cooperation to defection, they cooperate (100% - rounds 2, 4, 8, 12, 14)\n   - When I cooperate consecutively, they always defect in the second round (100% - rounds 7, 11)\n\n4. My updated point totals by strategy:\n   - Cooperation: 16 points over 8 rounds = 2.00 points/round\n   - Defection: 24 points over 7 rounds = 3.43 points/round\n\n5. Given that my opponent has now defected after I cooperated, the most reliable pattern suggests they will cooperate if I defect now.\n\n6. The data clearly shows that defection has consistently been more profitable for me, and the pattern of their cooperation after my defection has been 100% reliable.\n\n7. The rational strategy to maximize my points is to switch to defection, which has historically yielded 4 points in this situation.\n\n[move] (Switching to defection based on opponent's consistent pattern of cooperating after I defect) defection\n",

I need to refine my understanding of the opponent's pattern. Looking specifically at what happens after I switch from defection to cooperation:\n   - Round 3: I cooperated (after defecting), opponent defected\n   - Round 6: I cooperated (after defecting), opponent cooperated\n   - Round 10: I cooperated (after defecting), opponent cooperated\n   - Round 13: I cooperated (after defecting), opponent defected\n   - Round 15: I cooperated (after defecting), opponent defected\n\n3. The pattern is now clearer - my opponent tends to defect when I switch from defection to cooperation (3 out of 5 times). This revises my previous assessment.\n\n4. The most reliable patterns are:\n   - When I switch from cooperation to defection, they always cooperate (5/5 times)\n   - When I defect twice in a row, they always defect (2/2 times)\n\n5. My updated point totals by strategy:\n   - Cooperation: 16 points over 8 rounds = 2.0 points/round\n   - Defection: 24 points over 7 rounds = 3.43 points/round\n\n6.
