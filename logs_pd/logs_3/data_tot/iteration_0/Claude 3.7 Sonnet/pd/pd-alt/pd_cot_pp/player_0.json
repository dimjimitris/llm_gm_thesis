This interesting pattern suggests the opponent might be employing a strategy where they alternate moves or possibly responding to my previous moves.\n\n4. The opponent cooperated in round 2 after defecting in round 1. This could mean:\n   - They might be using an alternating strategy (defect-cooperate-defect)\n   - They might be trying to establish mutual cooperation\n   - They might be using a strategy like \"tit-for-tat\" but with one round delay\n\n5.

My opponent's behavior patterns are becoming clearer:\n   - After I defect twice in a row, they defect (rounds 5, 9)\n   - After I switch from defection to cooperation, they now seem to cooperate (rounds 6, 10)\n   - After I cooperate twice in a row, they previously defected (round 7)\n\n3. The pattern of mutual cooperation has now occurred twice (rounds 6 and 10), both times after I switched from defection to cooperation.\n\n4. In round 7, when I cooperated after a previous cooperation, they defected. This suggests they might exploit consecutive cooperative moves.\n\n5. I face a decision:\n   - Continue cooperating, hoping to maintain mutual cooperation (6 points)\n   - Defect, potentially getting 4 points if they continue cooperating\n\n6. The highest possible steady state is mutual cooperation (6 points each round). If there's a chance to establish this as a stable pattern, it's worth pursuing.\n\n7. However, based on round 7, there's a risk they'll defect if I cooperate again.\n\n8. Given the emerging pattern and the potential to establish ongoing mutual cooperation with its higher payoff, I'll take the risk and cooperate again. If they maintain cooperation, we'll both benefit maximally.\n\n[move] (Attempting to maintain mutual cooperation for maximum mutual benefit) cooperation\n"

A clearer pattern is emerging about my opponent's strategy:\n   - They appear to cooperate exactly once after I switch from defection to cooperation (rounds 6, 10)\n   - They consistently defect when I cooperate twice in a row (rounds 7, 11)\n   - After I defect twice in a row, they defect (rounds 5, 9)\n   - After I switch from cooperation to defection, they cooperate (rounds 2, 4, 8)\n\n3. This suggests my opponent is using a complex conditional strategy rather than a simple tit-for-tat or random approach.\n\n4. Based on the established pattern, if I defect now (after cooperating in round 11), my opponent is likely to cooperate as they did in rounds 2, 4, and 8.\n\n5. The pattern shows that attempting sustained mutual cooperation is not viable with this opponent - they exploit consecutive cooperation.\n\n6. My average points by move type:\n   - When I cooperate: 2.0 points per round (10 points over 5 rounds)\n   - When I defect: 3.2 points per round (16 points over 5 rounds)\n\n7. Given the opponent's demonstrated pattern and the point calculations, the rational move is to defect, which is likely to yield 4 points based on their previous behavior after I switch strategies.\n\n[move] (Switching to defection based on opponent's pattern of exploiting consecutive cooperation) defection\n"

The pattern in my opponent's behavior has remained consistent:\n   - Every time I switch from cooperation to defection, they cooperate (rounds 2, 4, 8, 12)\n   - When I cooperate after defection, they sometimes cooperate (rounds 6, 10) and sometimes defect (round 3)\n   - After consecutive cooperations from me, they defect (rounds 7, 11)\n   - After consecutive defections from me, they defect (rounds 5, 9)\n\n3.

Since my goal is to maximize my points, and the pattern suggests they'll cooperate if I switch from defection to cooperation, cooperating now seems like the best strategy to attempt to get 6 points from mutual cooperation.\n\n8. This approach follows an alternating strategy that could maximize my points by getting 4 points when I defect and 6 points when we both cooperate, rather than getting stuck in mutual defection (2 points each).\n\n[move] (Switching to cooperation based on the pattern that opponent tends to cooperate after I switch from defection) cooperation\n"

My previous pattern analysis needs revision. Looking at rounds 3, 13, and comparing with rounds 6, 10:\n   - In rounds 3 and 13, I cooperated after defecting, and opponent defected\n   - In rounds 6 and 10, I also cooperated after defecting, but opponent cooperated\n\n3. This suggests there might be additional factors in their decision-making that I haven't identified, or there could be some randomness in their strategy.\n\n4. What remains clear from the data:\n   - Every time I switch from cooperation to defection, they cooperate (rounds 2, 4, 8, 12)\n   - When I cooperate consecutively, they always defect in the second round (rounds 7, 11)\n   - After two consecutive defections from me, they defect (rounds 5, 9)\n\n5. My point totals by strategy:\n   - Cooperation: 15 points over 7 rounds = 2.14 points/round\n   - Defection: 20 points over 6 rounds = 3.33 points/round\n\n6. The most reliable pattern is that when I switch from cooperation to defection, they cooperate, giving me 4 points.\n\n7. Given the opponent's behavior pattern and the consistently better outcomes from defection, I should defect this round.

There's roughly a 50% chance they'll cooperate (6 points) and 50% chance they'll defect (1 point).\n\n7.

While defection has yielded higher average points overall (3.33 vs 2.14), in this specific situation following a defection-cooperation sequence, the expected value of cooperation is higher.\n\n9.
