Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since this is the first interaction, I'll start with cooperation as a signal of willingness to work together.\n\n5. Starting with cooperation might establish a cooperative norm that could benefit both players over time if the other player reciprocates.\n\n6. While defection could yield more points in the short term (6 vs 4), mutual cooperation would be better than mutual defection (4 vs 2) in the long run.\n\n7.

The pattern of mutual cooperation has been maintained flawlessly through twelve consecutive rounds, demonstrating an exceptionally robust and stable cooperative relationship.\n\n3. The other player has demonstrated remarkable consistency in choosing cooperation across all twelve rounds, establishing an extremely reliable behavioral pattern.\n\n4. Our mutual cooperation strategy has yielded 48 points each, compared to only 24 points each if we had both defected throughout - a 100% improvement.\n\n5. After twelve rounds of consistent cooperation, the predictive value of this history is extremely high - the other player has established a clear pattern that strongly suggests continued cooperation.\n\n6. In extended iterated games, especially after many rounds of established behavior, continuing the stable equilibrium is almost always the optimal strategy.\n\n7. The probability of mutual benefit from continued cooperation far outweighs the potential small, one-time gain from defection:\n   - Cooperation yields a reliable 4 points and maintains the beneficial pattern\n   - Defection might yield 6 points once but would likely trigger retaliation and reduce future returns\n\n8. There remains no strategic rationale to disrupt a pattern that has yielded optimal sustained outcomes for both players throughout the entire game.\n\n9. Based on all available evidence, game theoretical principles for repeated interactions, and the exceptionally consistent history, continuing cooperation remains the clearly optimal choice.\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"
