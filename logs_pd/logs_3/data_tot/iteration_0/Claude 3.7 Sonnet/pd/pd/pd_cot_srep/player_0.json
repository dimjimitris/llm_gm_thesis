He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player.

Given that the opponent has consistently defected, the safer choice is to defect again this round.\n11.

The sample size of 12 rounds is sufficiently large to conclude with high confidence that my opponent is committed to defection.\n5. In game theory terms, we have been locked in a Nash equilibrium of mutual defection for most of the game.\n6. While this equilibrium is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation, it requires both players to be willing to cooperate.\n7. At this stage in the repeated game, it would be irrational to expect my opponent to suddenly change their strategy.\n8. The expected value of cooperation remains 1 point while defection gives 2 points against this opponent.\n9. To maximize my points, I should continue matching my opponent's defection strategy.\n10. Even though we're entering later rounds, the demonstrated behavior pattern gives no reason to change my approach.\n11. I will continue with defection for this round.\n\n[move] (Continuing with defection based on opponent's unwavering defection strategy across all twelve previous rounds) defection"

After thirteen complete rounds, my opponent has defected in every single round, creating a perfect 13/13 defection record.\n2. This extreme consistency over many rounds confirms that my opponent is following a pure defection strategy.\n3. My point outcomes have been perfectly consistent with game theory predictions: 1 point when I cooperate (rounds 1 and 4) and 2 points when I defect (all other rounds).\n4. The repeated nature of this game has provided extensive opportunity to observe my opponent's unwavering commitment to defection.\n5. At this point, the probability that my opponent would suddenly change their strategy after 13 consecutive defections is negligible.\n6. Even in the final rounds of repeated games, players typically maintain consistent strategies unless there's a specific reason to change.\n7. The expected value calculation remains unchanged: cooperation yields 1 point while defection yields 2 points against this opponent.\n8. While mutual cooperation would yield better results (4 points each), there is overwhelming evidence that this outcome is unattainable.\n9. The rational choice to maximize my points continues to be defection.\n10.

My points have followed the exact pattern predicted by game theory: 1 point when I cooperate (rounds 1 and 4) and 2 points when I defect (all other rounds).\n4. The extensive history of this game (14 rounds) provides a statistically significant sample to conclude that my opponent will not cooperate.\n5. Even in potentially final rounds of a repeated game, when some players might change strategies, there's no indication my opponent will deviate from defection.\n6. The expected value calculation remains straightforward: cooperation yields 1 point while defection yields 2 points against this opponent.\n7. While I could test cooperation one more time on the extremely small chance of a strategy change, the expected outcome would be exploitation.\n8. The rational choice to maximize points against a consistent defector remains defection.\n9. After 14 rounds of evidence, changing my strategy now would not be justified by the data or game theory.\n10. I will continue with defection for this round.\n\n[move] (Continuing with defection based on opponent's unwavering defection strategy across all fourteen previous rounds) defection"

After fifteen complete rounds, my opponent has defected in every single round, creating a perfect 15/15 defection record.\n2.

My point outcomes have remained completely consistent with game theory: 1 point when I cooperate (rounds 1 and 4) and 2 points when I defect (all other rounds).\n4. With such an extensive game history, the statistical certainty that my opponent will defect in this round is extremely high.\n5. In game theory, when facing an opponent with a fixed strategy of defection, the optimal response is to defect as well.\n6. The expected value calculation is unchanged: cooperation yields 1 point while defection yields 2 points against this opponent.\n7. After 15 rounds of consistent behavior, there is no rational basis to expect my opponent to suddenly change strategies.\n8. While mutual cooperation would yield better results (4 points each), the evidence overwhelmingly indicates this outcome is impossible with this opponent.\n9. The rational choice to maximize my points remains defection.\n10. I will continue with defection for this round to secure the better outcome of 2 points rather than 1.\n\n[move] (Continuing with defection based on opponent's consistent defection strategy across all fifteen previous rounds) defection"
