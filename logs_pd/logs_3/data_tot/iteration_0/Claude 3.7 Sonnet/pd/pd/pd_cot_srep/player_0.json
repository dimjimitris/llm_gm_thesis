Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have information about their tendencies or strategy.\n\n3. In this type of game (resembling the Prisoner's Dilemma), mutual cooperation yields the best collective outcome (8 total points), while mutual defection is worse for both (4 total points).\n\n4. Starting with cooperation signals willingness to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes and may establish trust.\n\n5. However, defection provides protection against being exploited if the opponent defects.\n\n6. Since this is the first interaction, I'll choose cooperation as a good-faith opening move. This allows for the possibility of establishing mutual cooperation, which yields better long-term results than mutual defection.\n\n7.

In the previous round, I chose cooperation while my opponent chose defection.\n   - Result: I received 1 point, and they likely received 6 points.\n\n2. This indicates my opponent may be playing opportunistically or aggressively, exploiting my cooperative move.\n\n3. Now I need to decide how to respond. Several strategies are possible:\n   - Continue cooperating (risky if opponent continues to defect)\n   - Defect as a response to their defection (protective, potentially punishing)\n   - Use a conditional strategy (like tit-for-tat, where I mirror their previous move)\n\n4. Game theory suggests that in repeated interactions, a tit-for-tat strategy often performs well - cooperative but responsive to defection.\n\n5. Since my opponent defected in the previous round, a tit-for-tat strategy would suggest I should defect in this round.\n\n6. This serves two purposes:\n   - Protects me from being repeatedly exploited\n   - Signals to my opponent that defection has consequences\n\n7. If they recognize this pattern, they may switch to cooperation in future rounds, which would lead to better outcomes for both of us.\n\n8.

My switch to defection in response to their defection resulted in a slightly better outcome for me (2 points instead of 1), but we're not at the optimal mutual cooperation state (4 points each).\n\n4. Now I need to decide whether to continue defection or try cooperation again:\n   - Continuing mutual defection gives us each 2 points per round (suboptimal)\n   - If I can somehow establish mutual cooperation, we'd each get 4 points (optimal)\n\n5. In repeated games, breaking out of mutual defection can be difficult but important. Someone needs to take the initiative to attempt cooperation first.\n\n6. There's a risk in cooperating again - if the opponent defects, I'll only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\n7. However, without attempting cooperation again, we may be stuck in mutual defection (2 points each) indefinitely.\n\n8. This could be an opportunity to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. If they recognize this and reciprocate, we both benefit.\n\n9. Since the potential gain from mutual cooperation is significant, and we've already established I won't be continually exploited (by defecting last round), I'll take a calculated risk and cooperate again.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

Given this pattern, continued cooperation would likely result in continued exploitation. The evidence suggests my opponent is not interested in mutual cooperation.\n\n7. Game theory suggests that against a consistently defecting opponent, the best response is to also defect, as this minimizes losses.\n\n8. While cooperation would yield the highest mutual benefit (4 points each), it requires both players to choose it.

When I defected (rounds 2 and 4), we reached a Nash equilibrium of mutual defection, giving us each 2 points.\n\n6. While mutual cooperation would be ideal (4 points each), it requires both players to choose it. My opponent has shown no indication they will ever cooperate.\n\n7.

I've tested cooperation twice in earlier rounds (rounds 1 and 3), and both times my opponent exploited this by defecting, giving me only 1 point while they received 6.\n\n5. At this stage of the game, with such an extensive history of consistent defection from my opponent, there is virtually no reason to believe they would suddenly change their strategy.\n\n6. In game theory terms, we appear to be playing against a \"pure defector\" - an opponent who always defects regardless of context.\n\n7. Against such an opponent, the optimal strategy is to also defect in every round to maximize one's own payoff.\n\n8. While it's theoretically possible that a cooperative move could surprise my opponent into reciprocating, eleven rounds of consistent behavior make this extremely unlikely.\n\n9. The expected value calculations remain unchanged: cooperation yields an expected 1 point (assuming opponent defects), while defection yields an expected 2 points.\n\n10. Based on all available evidence, I will continue to defect to secure the more reliable outcome of 2 points.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Defection\n"

With such an extensive history, the evidence is overwhelming that my opponent is employing a pure defection strategy.\n\n6. We are now in what game theorists call a \"Nash equilibrium\" of mutual defection - neither player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\n7. If I were to switch to cooperation at this point, my expected outcome would decrease from 2 points to 1 point, as there's no reason to believe my opponent would suddenly cooperate after twelve rounds of consistent defection.\n\n8. While mutual cooperation (4 points each) would be ideal, it requires both players to choose cooperation - something my opponent has shown no willingness to do.\n\n9.
