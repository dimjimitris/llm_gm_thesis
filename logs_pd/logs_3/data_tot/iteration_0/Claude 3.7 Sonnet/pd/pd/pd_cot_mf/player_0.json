The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

While defection might seem better purely from a points perspective, cooperation establishes goodwill and may lead to sustained mutual cooperation (4 points each round) which is better than sustained mutual defection (2 points each round).\n\n5.

Since the other player cooperated in the first round, it's reasonable to expect they may cooperate again. If we both continue cooperating, we'll both continue earning 4 points per round.\n\n5. I could try to defect to get 6 points this round, but this risks breaking the cooperative pattern. If they respond to my defection by also defecting in future rounds, we'd both end up with only 2 points per round going forward, which is worse than the 4 points from mutual cooperation.\n\n6. The sustainable strategy that maximizes long-term points is to continue cooperating as long as the other player cooperates.\n\n7.

Since my opponent has shown willingness to defect after establishing cooperation, there's a risk they're trying to maximize their advantage.\n\n7. Using a tit-for-tat strategy (responding to their previous move) is often effective in these games. Since they just defected, I should defect this round.\n\n8.

The pattern suggests my opponent might be testing different strategies or responding to my moves.\n\n5. After they defected in Round 2, I responded with defection in Round 3, resulting in mutual defection (2 points each).\n\n6. This establishes that I'm willing to punish defection, but continuing mutual defection is suboptimal for both of us (2 points each) compared to mutual cooperation (4 points each).\n\n7. A strong strategy in these games is often \"tit-for-tat with forgiveness\" - respond to what the opponent did last round, but occasionally offer cooperation to test if we can re-establish mutual cooperation.\n\n8. Since we're now in a mutual defection state, one of us needs to take the risk to attempt returning to mutual cooperation.\n\n9. If I cooperate now and they continue to defect, I'll only get 1 point. But if they also choose to cooperate, we both get 4 points again.\n\n10. I'll take the initiative to break out of the mutual defection cycle by cooperating.
