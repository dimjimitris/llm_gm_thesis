Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma-type game where defection is individually rational (highest personal payoff) but mutual cooperation leads to better collective outcomes.\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any historical information about their strategy.\n\n4. Starting with cooperation can:\n   - Signal willingness to achieve mutual benefit (4 points each)\n   - Establish a cooperative norm\n   - Risk getting exploited (getting only 1 point)\n\n5. Starting with defection can:\n   - Guarantee at least 2 points (if other player also defects)\n   - Potentially get 6 points (if other player cooperates)\n   - But might set a negative precedent for future rounds\n\n6. Since this appears to be a repeated game (based on the discussion of \"rounds\"), I'll choose cooperation as my first move to encourage mutual cooperation, which has better long-term potential.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Cooperation\n"

Through thirteen consecutive rounds, both the other player and I have consistently chosen cooperation.\n2. This pattern of mutual cooperation has earned each of us 4 points per round (total of 52 points so far).\n3. The other player has demonstrated unwavering reliability in choosing cooperation throughout all previous rounds.\n4. Our cooperative relationship continues to yield optimal results for both players.\n5. Analyzing the current situation:\n   - Thirteen rounds of perfect cooperation establishes an extremely strong precedent and expectation\n   - The cumulative benefit of cooperation (52 points each) significantly outperforms what mutual defection would have yielded (26 points each)\n   - The other player's consistent behavior over such an extended period suggests a firm commitment to cooperation\n   - The stability of our interaction indicates a mutual understanding of the benefits of continued cooperation\n   - There have been no signals or changes that would provide any rational basis for changing strategy\n6. With such an extensive history of successful cooperation, continuing this approach remains the clearly optimal strategy.\n7. The established pattern has produced consistently positive outcomes and there is no strategic reason to deviate from it.\n8.

This pattern of mutual cooperation has earned each of us 4 points per round (total of 56 points so far).\n3. The other player has shown perfect reliability in choosing cooperation across all previous rounds.\n4. Our cooperative relationship continues to provide the best sustainable outcome for both players.\n5. Analyzing the situation further:\n   - Fourteen rounds of unbroken cooperation demonstrates an exceptional level of strategic alignment between players\n   - The cumulative advantage of cooperation (56 points each) now substantially exceeds what we would have earned through mutual defection (28 points each)\n   - The other player's consistent behavior provides overwhelming evidence that they are committed to a cooperative strategy\n   - Our established pattern has been so reliable and beneficial that there would need to be a significant change in circumstances to justify a different approach\n   - Even if the game might be nearing its conclusion, cooperation remains the rational choice as it guarantees 4 points versus the 2 points from mutual defection\n6. After such an extensive history of successful mutual cooperation, the evidence strongly supports continuing with this approach.\n7. The stability and predictability of our cooperative relationship continues to provide maximum sustainable benefit for both players.\n8.
