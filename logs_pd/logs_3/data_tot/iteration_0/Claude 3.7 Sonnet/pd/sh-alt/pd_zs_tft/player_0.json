You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The stag strategy offers higher rewards but requires coordination. The hare strategy is safer but yields lower rewards when both choose it.\n\nSince I'm facing a fresh player with no prior history, I have a few considerations:\n- Choosing stag could yield the highest reward (4 points) if we coordinate\n- Choosing hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points)\n- In the absence of communication or history, many game theory analyses suggest players tend toward the risk-dominant strategy (hare)\n\nHowever, I'll choose the payoff-dominant option and hope for coordination:\n\n[move] stag.
