The stag strategy offers higher rewards but requires coordination. The hare strategy is safer but yields lower rewards when both choose it.\n\nSince I'm facing a fresh player with no prior history, I have a few considerations:\n- Choosing stag could yield the highest reward (4 points) if we coordinate\n- Choosing hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points)\n- In the absence of communication or history, many game theory analyses suggest players tend toward the risk-dominant strategy (hare)\n\nHowever, I'll choose the payoff-dominant option and hope for coordination:\n\n[move] stag.
