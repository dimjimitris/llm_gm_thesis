He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

Let me analyze the payoff matrix first:\n   - Both choose stag: we both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: we both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag + other chooses hare: I get 1, they get 6\n   - I choose hare + other chooses stag: I get 6, they get 1\n\n2. This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: both choosing stag or both choosing hare.\n\n3. The stag-stag outcome (4,4) is Pareto-optimal and yields the highest mutual benefit.\n\n4. However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n\n5. Choosing hare is safer - I'm guaranteed at least 2 points, and possibly 6 if the other player chooses stag.\n\n6. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, they might be inclined to choose the safer option (hare).\n\n7. However, if I signal cooperation by choosing stag, we might establish a pattern of mutual cooperation.\n\n8. The potential reward of mutual cooperation (4 points each round) outweighs the risk of occasionally getting only 1 point.\n\n9. I'll choose stag as my opening move to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag (I'm choosing stag to establish mutual cooperation for our highest combined payoff)\n"

The fact that they chose stag in the first round indicates they understand the advantage of mutual cooperation.\n\n4. Given that we successfully coordinated on the Pareto-optimal outcome in the first round, it makes sense to continue with this strategy.\n\n5.
