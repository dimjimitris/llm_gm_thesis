Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a classic Stag Hunt game, where cooperation (both choosing stag) leads to the best collective outcome, but carries risk.\n\n2. Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each (best collective outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (safer but less rewarding)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point (best for me individually)\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I don't have information about their tendencies or strategy.\n\n4. There are two reasonable approaches:\n   - Risk-averse: Choose hare to guarantee at least 2 points\n   - Cooperative: Choose stag to aim for the best collective outcome\n\n5. Since the collective optimal choice is stag-stag (4 points each), I'll try to establish cooperation from the beginning. If the other player is rational and recognizes this, we could both benefit.\n\n6. If I start with stag, I signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n7. The worst case is getting only 1 point if they choose hare, but the potential upside of 4 points makes it worth the risk for the first move.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing stag to establish mutual cooperation, aiming for the optimal collective outcome.\n"

Let me review the possible outcomes again:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each (best collective outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (safer but less rewarding)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point (best for me individually)\n\n4.

I have two main choices:\n   - Continue cooperating (choose stag): Maintain mutual trust and continue earning 4 points each\n   - Exploit their cooperation (choose hare): Potentially earn 6 points at their expense\n\n6. If I exploit them by choosing hare, I might get 6 points this round, but they might retaliate in future rounds by also choosing hare, resulting in both of us only getting 2 points per round.\n\n7. The long-term strategy of continued cooperation (both choosing stag) is more beneficial than short-term exploitation.\n\n8.

This consistent cooperative behavior suggests we've established a stable and mutually beneficial equilibrium.\n\n3.

There's no indication that the other player is likely to deviate from the cooperative strategy.\n\n5. While I could potentially get 6 points by choosing hare, this would:\n   - Break the established trust\n   - Likely lead to the other player choosing hare in future rounds\n   - Result in both of us getting only 2 points per round going forward\n\n6. The long-term expected value of continued cooperation (4 points per round) exceeds the short-term gain from defection followed by mutual distrust (6 points once, then 2 points per round).\n\n7. Mathematical reasoning: If we play n more rounds after this one, choosing stag each time gives me 4n points. Defecting once gives me 6 + 2(n-1) = 2n + 4 points. For n > 2, the cooperative strategy yields more points.\n\n8.
