You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The cooperative equilibrium (stag-stag) gives the highest collective benefit, but choosing hare is safer since it guarantees at least 2 points and possibly 6.\n\nSince this is our first interaction and we're both fresh players, I'll try the cooperative approach first to potentially establish mutual trust. If we both choose stag, we each get the optimal sustainable outcome.\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing cooperation for mutual benefit. If we both choose stag, we both get 4 points which is better than the 2 points each we'd get from both choosing hare."
