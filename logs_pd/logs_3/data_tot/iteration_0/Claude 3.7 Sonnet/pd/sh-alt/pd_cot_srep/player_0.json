Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I'll look at the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: We each get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: We each get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, opponent gets 6 points\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, opponent gets 1 point\n\n2. Let me consider the strategic implications:\n   - Stag has the highest mutual benefit (4 points each) if we cooperate\n   - Hare is safer because it guarantees at least 2 points, and potentially 6 points\n   - If I choose stag and my opponent chooses hare, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I'm playing against a fresh player:\n   - There's no history to base my decision on\n   - The cooperative outcome (both stag) is most beneficial for overall points\n   - By choosing stag, I signal willingness to cooperate which might encourage the other player to do the same\n\n4. If the opponent is rational and also wants to maximize joint welfare, they should choose stag as well\n\n5. While choosing hare is the safer option, I'll aim for the cooperative equilibrium which has higher mutual benefit\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag and hope the other player does the same.\n\n[move] stag"

Consider what this means about my opponent:\n   - They chose the exploitative option rather than cooperating\n   - They may be playing to maximize their individual points rather than mutual benefit\n   - They may continue this strategy if they think I'll choose stag again\n\n3. Evaluate my options now:\n   - If I choose stag again and they choose hare again, I'll get only 1 point again\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare, we both get 2 points\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 6 points and they get 1\n   - If we both switch to stag, we both get 4 points\n\n4. Since my opponent chose the exploitative move in round 1, there's a good chance they'll do it again\n   - Choosing stag would be risky as they've shown they're willing to exploit\n   - Choosing hare protects me from the worst outcome\n   - If they switch to stag hoping I'll do the same, I can benefit with 6 points\n\n5. Given the opponent's previous behavior, the safest and potentially most rewarding move is to choose hare\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare as a defensive move and to potentially get more points if my opponent switches to stag.\n\n[move] hare"

Consider the game theory perspective at this milestone:\n   - After ten rounds, we can conclude with high confidence that my opponent is committed to a fixed hare strategy\n   - This strategy might be predetermined, automated, or simply their dominant preference\n   - The Nash equilibrium of (hare, hare) has been firmly established\n\n4.
