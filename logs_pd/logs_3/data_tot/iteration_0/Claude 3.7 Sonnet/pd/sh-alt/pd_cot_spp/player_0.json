He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, they get 6\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6, they get 1\n\n2. This is a classic Stag Hunt game with a twist (normally hare-hare would give less than stag-stag). Let me analyze the risk vs. reward:\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice with highest mutual benefit (4 points each)\n   - Hare is safer because the worst outcome is 2 points\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare, I only get 1 point (worst outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get the maximum possible (6 points)\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies. I need to balance cooperation potential with risk protection.\n\n4. The stag option has a higher cooperative payoff (4 > 2) but carries risk. The hare option gives me a chance at the maximum payoff and protects me from the worst outcome.\n\n5. For the first move, I'll choose stag as it signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. If we both choose stag consistently, we both maximize our collective points.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to establish a cooperative precedent.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Since the other player chose stag in the first round, they've demonstrated willingness to cooperate.\n\n4. If we continue with this pattern, we can both continue earning 4 points per round, which is better than the 2 points we'd get if we both chose hare.\n\n5. There is still the temptation to choose hare while hoping they stick with stag, which would give me 6 points. However, this might break the cooperative pattern and lead to less optimal outcomes in future rounds.\n\n6. Since the other player demonstrated cooperation in round 1, and continued cooperation benefits us both, the rational choice is to maintain the stag strategy.\n\n7.
