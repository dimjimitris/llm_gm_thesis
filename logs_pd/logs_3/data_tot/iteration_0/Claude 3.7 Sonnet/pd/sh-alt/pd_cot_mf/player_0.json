Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, there's no history to consider.\n4. Choosing stag is risky but has the potential for the best mutual outcome.\n5. Choosing hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) and could potentially yield 6 points.\n6.

Round 11: I \"stag\", opponent \"hare\" \u2192 1 point for me, 6 for them (exploitation yet again)\n\n7. My attempt to test whether cooperation might be possible in round 11 was unsuccessful:\n   - The opponent maintained their strategy of choosing \"hare\"\n   - I received only 1 point, confirming the risk of attempting cooperation\n   - This is now the third time I've been exploited when choosing \"stag\" after round 1\n\n8. The opponent's pattern is remarkably consistent:\n   - They've now chosen \"hare\" for 10 consecutive rounds\n   - They have exploited every single attempt at cooperation after the initial round\n\n9. This latest test strongly reinforces that the opponent has a fixed strategy of choosing \"hare\" regardless of the game's history.\n\n10. Given this evidence, there's no strategic reason to choose \"stag\" again:\n    - The probability of the opponent suddenly switching to \"stag\" is extremely low\n    - Every test of cooperation has resulted in exploitation\n    - The stable \"hare-hare\" equilibrium (2 points each) is clearly superior to being exploited (1 point)\n\n11. I will return to choosing \"hare\" to secure the 2 points in this suboptimal but stable Nash equilibrium.\n\n[move] hare\n"

The evidence is overwhelming regarding the opponent's strategy:\n   - They've chosen \"hare\" for 11 consecutive rounds\n   - They've exploited every single attempt at cooperation after the first round\n   - Their strategy appears to be fixed and unresponsive to my choices\n\n9.
