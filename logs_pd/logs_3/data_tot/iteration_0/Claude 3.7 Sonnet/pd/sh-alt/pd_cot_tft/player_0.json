He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The pattern has been extremely consistent:\n   - My opponent chose stag only in round 1\n   - They have chosen hare in 8 consecutive rounds (rounds 2-9)\n\n3. We've been in a stable Nash equilibrium for many rounds, with both of us choosing hare and receiving 2 points each.\n\n4. At this point, I should consider whether a different approach might yield better results.\n\n5. One possibility is to attempt a \"reset\" by choosing stag again, hoping my opponent might reciprocate cooperation after so many rounds of mutual hare choices.\n\n6. However, my past attempts to choose stag (in rounds 2 and 4) were exploited, resulting in only 1 point for me.\n\n7. Given the payoff structure and my opponent's consistent behavior:\n   - If they choose hare (highly probable based on 8 consecutive rounds) and I choose stag: I get 1 point\n   - If they choose hare and I choose hare: I get 2 points\n\n8. While the cooperative outcome would be better (4 points each), there's no evidence my opponent is willing to cooperate after the initial round.\n\n9. The rational choice continues to be hare, which guarantees me 2 points in this established pattern.\n\n10. If this were the final round, I might consider stag as a last attempt, but since there may be more rounds to come, maintaining the stable outcome is preferable to risking exploitation.\n\n[move] (Continuing with the established equilibrium strategy) hare\n"

The pattern has been remarkably consistent:\n   - My opponent chose stag only in round 1\n   - They have chosen hare in 9 consecutive rounds (rounds 2-10)\n   - I've chosen hare in rounds 3, 5-10 and received a consistent 2 points in each of those rounds\n\n3. We are locked in a suboptimal but stable equilibrium of mutual defection (both choosing hare).\n\n4. After 10 rounds with such a clear pattern, I need to consider if there's any strategic reason to change my approach:\n\n5. If this were an infinitely repeated game, attempting to establish cooperation might be worthwhile. However, my previous attempts at cooperation in rounds 2 and 4 were exploited.\n\n6. The expected values remain:\n   - Choosing stag: likely to yield 1 point (if opponent chooses hare as they have for 9 consecutive rounds)\n   - Choosing hare: guaranteed to yield 2 points if opponent chooses hare\n\n7. While there's a remote possibility my opponent might switch to stag after so many rounds of mutual hare choices, their consistent behavior makes this extremely unlikely.\n\n8.
