Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider the risk/reward carefully.\n\nThe cooperative choice (stag-stag) maximizes total points (8), while any other combination leads to a total of 7 or fewer points. However, choosing \"hare\" protects me from getting the worst payoff if the other player chooses hare.\n\nGiven this is our first interaction and there's no history to base decisions on, I'll choose stag, hoping to establish a cooperative pattern that benefits both of us.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing cooperation for mutual benefit, hoping we can establish trust.\n"
