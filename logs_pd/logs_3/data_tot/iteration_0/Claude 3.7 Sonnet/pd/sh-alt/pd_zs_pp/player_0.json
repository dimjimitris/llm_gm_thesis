You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider the risk/reward carefully.\n\nThe cooperative choice (stag-stag) maximizes total points (8), while any other combination leads to a total of 7 or fewer points. However, choosing \"hare\" protects me from getting the worst payoff if the other player chooses hare.\n\nGiven this is our first interaction and there's no history to base decisions on, I'll choose stag, hoping to establish a cooperative pattern that benefits both of us.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing cooperation for mutual benefit, hoping we can establish trust.\n"
