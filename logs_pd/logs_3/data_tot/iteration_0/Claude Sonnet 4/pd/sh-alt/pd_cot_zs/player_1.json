My opponent has chosen hare for ELEVEN consecutive rounds since their single stag attempt in round 3.\n\nThe pattern:\n- Rounds 1, 2: Both hare\n- Round 3: I hare, they stag (the lesson that changed everything)\n- Rounds 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13: Both hare\n\nEleven consecutive identical choices is almost unprecedented in strategic game behavior. This opponent has created what is essentially a risk-free routine, turning a strategic game into a predictable pattern.\n\nAt this extreme level of consistency, I'm starting to wonder if the very absurdity of the situation might eventually create pressure for change. After eleven rounds of the same outcome, some psychological factors might emerge:\n- Mental fatigue from repetitive choices\n- Growing awareness of the foregone mutual benefits (we could be getting 4 points each)\n- The possibility that such extreme predictability becomes boring\n\nBut the behavioral evidence is absolutely overwhelming. Eleven identical choices after one negative experience shows someone who has made an almost pathological commitment to avoiding risk. They appear to have decided that any deviation from hare is simply not worth considering.\n\nGiven this incredible consistency, the rational prediction remains unchanged.\n\n[move] (Eleven consecutive rounds of hare represents an almost pathological commitment to risk avoidance that shows no signs of changing) hare"

Twelve identical moves after a single failure suggests they've made risk avoidance their entire strategy.\n\nThe evidence still strongly supports their continued commitment to hare, but I'm beginning to sense this level of repetition might eventually create its own pressures for change.\n\n[move] (Twelve consecutive rounds shows extreme commitment to safety, though such repetition might eventually create pressure for variation) hare"
