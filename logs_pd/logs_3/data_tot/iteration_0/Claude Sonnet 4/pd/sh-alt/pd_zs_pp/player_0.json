This appears to be a variant of the Stag Hunt game.\n\nLet me look at the payoff matrix:\n- Both choose stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n- Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2  \n- I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n- I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\nThe key considerations:\n1. If I could guarantee the opponent would choose stag, then stag would be optimal (4 points vs 2)\n2. If I think the opponent will choose hare, then hare is better (6 points vs 1)\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might be risk-averse and choose the safer hare option\n4. Hare gives me either 6 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n5. Stag gives me either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare)\n\nGiven the uncertainty about a fresh player's choice and that hare has a higher potential payoff with a reasonable worst-case scenario, I'll choose hare.\n\n[move] hare"
