You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Fresh players often choose the safer option (Hare) because it guarantees at least 2 points regardless of what I do, whereas Stag could give them only 1 point if I choose Hare.\n\nHowever, if they choose Stag and I also choose Stag, we both get the optimal mutual benefit of 4 points. But if I assume they'll choose Hare (the safer option for an inexperienced player), then I should choose Hare to get 6 points instead of just 1.\n\nGiven that they're a fresh player, I'll assume they're more likely to play it safe with Hare.\n\n[move] Hare"
