Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the key strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with coordination and risk elements\n   - Stag is the cooperative choice that yields mutual benefit (4,4)\n   - Hare is the safe choice that guarantees at least 2 points\n   - There's asymmetric risk: choosing stag when opponent chooses hare gives only 1 point\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not understand the coordination aspect\n   - They might choose hare as the \"safer\" option\n   - They might choose randomly without deep strategic thinking\n   - They might be tempted by the possibility of getting 6 points\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 4 (good outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 (bad outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 6 (best outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 (safe outcome)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against a fresh player, there's higher uncertainty about their choice\n   - Hare guarantees at least 2 points and could give me 6\n   - Stag risks only getting 1 point if they don't cooperate\n   - Since this appears to be a one-shot game with an unknown player, the safer strategy seems more prudent\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to minimize risk while maintaining upside potential.\n\n[move] hare"

Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If they expect me to choose hare again, they might choose stag to get 6 points\n   - If they think I'm predictable with hare, choosing stag could give us both 4 points (if they also switch to stag)\n   - If they stick with their hare strategy, choosing hare gives us both 2 points again\n   - If they stick with hare and I choose stag, I only get 1 point\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The fact that we both chose hare suggests we might both be thinking similarly\n   - There's a possibility they're also analyzing the game and might switch to stag\n   - If we're both strategic players who chose the safe option first, we might both be ready to try cooperation (stag) now\n   - The mutual hare choice creates a foundation for potential cooperation\n\nFinal decision: Switch to stag, betting that my opponent is also strategic and might be ready to cooperate for the better mutual outcome.\n\n[move] stag"

Analyze my opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - Round 1: hare\n   - Round 2: hare  \n   - Round 3: hare\n   - They have chosen hare consistently in ALL three rounds\n   - This is a very strong pattern suggesting a committed hare strategy\n\n3. Consider my opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They're getting consistent results with hare (2, 6, 2 points)\n   - They got their best result (6 points) in Round 2 when I chose stag\n   - They might view hare as a dominant strategy\n   - They may be playing it safe or have decided this is optimal against an unpredictable opponent\n\n4.

Analyze my opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - Round 1: hare\n   - Round 2: hare  \n   - Round 3: hare\n   - Round 4: hare\n   - They have chosen hare in ALL four rounds without exception\n   - This is an extremely strong pattern indicating a fixed hare strategy\n\n3. Consider the strength of this pattern:\n   - 4/4 rounds = 100% consistency\n   - They've had multiple opportunities to switch but haven't\n   - Even when I chose stag in Round 2 and they got 6 points, they still stuck with hare\n   - This suggests they're either committed to this strategy or view it as optimal\n\n4.

Analyze the dramatic pattern change:\n   - My opponent chose hare for 4 consecutive rounds (100% consistency)\n   - Then suddenly switched to stag in Round 5\n   - This is a significant strategic shift after establishing a clear pattern\n\n3. Consider why my opponent might have switched:\n   - They may have been analyzing my behavior and noticed I switched back to hare\n   - They might have been waiting for me to settle into a predictable pattern\n   - They could be testing if I'll stick with hare or adapt to their change\n   - They may have realized that mutual cooperation (stag-stag) gives better long-term results\n   - They might be trying to break the repetitive hare-hare cycle\n\n4. Evaluate what they might expect from me now:\n   - They know I just got 6 points (my best possible outcome)\n   - They might expect me to stick with hare since it just paid off handsomely\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to stag to try for mutual cooperation\n   - They got only 1 point in Round 5, so they might reconsider their strategy\n\n5. Strategic reasoning for Round 6:\n   - If they return to hare (possible, given they just got 1 point):\n     \u2022 If I choose stag: I get 1 point\n     \u2022 If I choose hare: I get 2 points\n   - If they continue with stag (showing a real strategy change):\n     \u2022 If I choose stag: I get 4 points (mutual cooperation)\n     \u2022 If I choose hare: I get 6 points again\n   - The switch to stag might signal they're ready for cooperation\n   - But it could also be a one-time experiment\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag to test if they're genuinely switching to a cooperation strategy, as mutual stag-stag gives us both better long-term results than the hare-hare pattern.\n\n[move] stag"

Strategic reasoning for Round 9:\n   - My opponent just returned to hare after the alternating experiment\n   - They might stick with hare since it's been more profitable for them\n   - If they choose hare:\n     \u2022 If I choose stag: I get 1 point (worst outcome)\n     \u2022 If I choose hare: I get 2 points (safe outcome)\n   - If they choose stag:\n     \u2022 If I choose stag: I get 4 points (cooperation)\n     \u2022 If I choose hare: I get 6 points (best outcome)\n   - My track record shows hare consistently outperforms stag for me\n   - I've never regretted choosing hare, but I've regretted choosing stag twice\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare strategy, as it has been consistently superior and protects against the worst outcome while maintaining upside potential.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze my opponent's recent behavior:\n   - Round 8: hare (broke alternating pattern)\n   - Round 9: hare (two hares in a row)\n   - They appear to be returning to their original hare-dominant strategy\n   - This suggests they may have realized hare is more profitable for them\n\n3. Consider the strategic landscape:\n   - We're now in a pattern similar to Rounds 1-4 (mutual hare choices)\n   - My opponent might be settling back into consistent hare play\n   - They've experimented with stag but seem to be reverting to hare\n\n4. Analyze the risk-reward:\n   - My performance with hare: 2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 2, 2 points (average: 3.14)\n   - My performance with stag: 1, 1 points (average: 1.0)\n   - Hare has been dramatically more successful for me\n   - Every single time I chose stag, I got the worst possible outcome (1 point)\n\n5.
