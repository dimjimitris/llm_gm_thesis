The key considerations are:\n\n1. Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the best joint outcome (4 each)\n2. But there's risk - if I choose stag and opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n3. Choosing hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) and gives a chance for 6 points if opponent chooses stag\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might:\n- Choose randomly\n- Go for the safe option (hare)\n- Not fully understand the cooperation benefits\n\nGiven the uncertainty about their choice and the significant penalty for miscoordinated stag (only 1 point), I should choose the safer option that gives me a better expected outcome.\n\n[move] hare"

My opponent chose stag while I chose hare, giving me 6 points and them only 1 point.\n\nThis tells me something important about my opponent's strategy:\n- They went for the cooperative/trusting move (stag) in the first round\n- They likely expected mutual cooperation for the 4-4 outcome\n- They now know I chose the safer/more opportunistic move\n\nFor this second round, I need to consider:\n1. My opponent just got burned (1 point vs my 6), so they might:\n   - Switch to hare for safety\n   - Stick with stag hoping I'll cooperate this time\n   - Feel betrayed and choose hare as retaliation\n\n2. If they switch to hare now, we'll both get 2 points\n3. If they stick with stag and I choose stag too, we both get 4 points\n4. If they stick with stag and I choose hare again, I get another 6 points\n\nThe rational response for them would be to switch to hare after being exploited.

If we both keep choosing hare, we'll keep getting 2 points each\n2. If I switch to stag and they stick with hare, I get 1 point (bad for me)\n3. If I switch to stag and they also switch to stag, we both get 4 points (much better)\n4.

This remarkable consistency demonstrates they have adopted a completely fixed, unwavering strategy.\n\nThe evidence is conclusive:\n- Thirteen identical choices in a row shows absolute strategic commitment\n- They've passed up thirteen consecutive chances to attempt cooperation\n- Their behavior has become entirely mechanical and predictable\n- We're in a perfectly stable, permanent equilibrium\n\nAt this point, my opponent's choice is as certain as any prediction can be in strategic interaction. They have established with complete reliability that they will choose hare every time, guaranteeing themselves 2 points while avoiding any risk.\n\nGiven this absolutely unshakeable pattern with zero variation over thirteen consecutive rounds, continuing with the same strategy that guarantees 2 points remains the optimal choice.\n\n[move] hare"
