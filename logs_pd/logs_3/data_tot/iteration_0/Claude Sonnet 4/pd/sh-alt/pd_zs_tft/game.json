The key considerations are:\n\n1. Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the best joint outcome (4 each)\n2. But there's risk - if I choose stag and opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n3. Choosing hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) and gives a chance for 6 points if opponent chooses stag\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might:\n- Choose randomly\n- Go for the safe option (hare)\n- Not fully understand the cooperation benefits\n\nGiven the uncertainty about their choice and the significant penalty for miscoordinated stag (only 1 point), I should choose the safer option that gives me a better expected outcome.\n\n[move] hare"

My opponent just got burned (1 point vs my 6), so they might:\n   - Switch to hare for safety\n   - Stick with stag hoping I'll cooperate this time\n   - Feel betrayed and choose hare as retaliation\n\n2.

The key considerations are:\n\n1. Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the best joint outcome (4 each)\n2. But there's risk - if I choose stag and opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n3. Choosing hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) and gives a chance for 6 points if opponent chooses stag\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might:\n- Choose randomly\n- Go for the safe option (hare)\n- Not fully understand the cooperation benefits\n\nGiven the uncertainty about their choice and the significant penalty for miscoordinated stag (only 1 point), I should choose the safer option that gives me a better expected outcome.\n\n[move] hare",

My opponent just got burned (1 point vs my 6), so they might:\n   - Switch to hare for safety\n   - Stick with stag hoping I'll cooperate this time\n   - Feel betrayed and choose hare as retaliation\n\n2. If they switch to hare now, we'll both get 2 points\n3. If they stick with stag and I choose stag too, we both get 4 points\n4. If they stick with stag and I choose hare again, I get another 6 points\n\nThe rational response for them would be to switch to hare after being exploited.
