Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points\n\n2. Consider the risk-reward tradeoffs:\n   - Stag is the \"cooperative\" choice that yields mutual benefit (4 points each) if both players cooperate\n   - Hare is the \"defection\" choice that yields high reward (6 points) if I defect while opponent cooperates, but lower mutual reward (2 points each) if both defect\n\n3. Analyze what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not immediately recognize the cooperative strategy\n   - They might choose randomly or go for the potentially higher payoff\n   - They likely haven't developed trust or established patterns yet\n\n4. Determine my best strategy:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 4 points (good)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (bad for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 6 points (excellent for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (okay)\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player with unknown tendencies, choosing hare gives me either the best outcome (6 points) or a decent outcome (2 points), while avoiding the worst outcome for me (1 point).\n\n[move] hare"

Consider what my opponent might do now:\n   - They just experienced getting only 1 point while I got 6\n   - They may feel \"burned\" by trying to cooperate\n   - A rational player might switch to hare to avoid being exploited again\n   - They might also stick with stag if they're committed to cooperation\n\n3. Evaluate my options for Round 2:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 4 points each (mutual cooperation)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point for me (I get exploited)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 6 points for me again (unlikely they'll repeat)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points each (mutual defection)\n\n4.

Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag is risky because the opponent is likely to defect after last round\n   - Choosing hare ensures I get at least 2 points and possibly 6 if they surprisingly cooperate again\n\n[move] hare"

Recognize the deeply entrenched pattern:\n   - We've now had 4 consecutive rounds of mutual defection (Rounds 7-10)\n   - My opponent has NEVER attempted cooperation throughout the entire game\n   - The pattern is completely predictable: they exploit any cooperation attempt and default to hare otherwise\n   - This is the most stable mutual defection equilibrium possible\n\n3. Assess the strategic reality:\n   - This opponent plays a purely defensive/exploitative strategy\n   - They have shown zero willingness to move toward mutual cooperation\n   - Any attempt at cooperation by me results in immediate punishment\n   - The 2-2 outcome is clearly their preferred stable state\n\n4. Consider if there's any reason to change:\n   - No new information suggests the opponent would cooperate\n   - The mutual defection pattern has been rock-solid for 4 rounds\n   - Breaking this pattern would only benefit my opponent\n   - There's absolutely no strategic advantage to trying stag again\n\n5. Final strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has established they are not a cooperative player\n   - Mutual defection is the Nash equilibrium against this type of opponent\n   - Maintaining hare is the only rational choice that protects my interests\n   - This strategy maximizes my expected value against this particular opponent\n\n[move] hare"
