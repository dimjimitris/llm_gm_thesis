Identify key strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with cooperation vs defection dynamics\n   - If I could guarantee cooperation, stag-stag (4,4) is better than hare-hare (2,2)\n   - However, if opponent chooses hare while I choose stag, I only get 1 point\n   - If I choose hare while opponent chooses stag, I get the maximum 6 points\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often choose safer/defensive options\n   - Hare is the safer choice since it guarantees at least 2 points and offers upside of 6\n\n4. Formulate strategy:\n   - Against an uncertain opponent, hare provides better risk-reward\n   - Worst case with hare: 2 points (if both choose hare)\n   - Best case with hare: 6 points (if opponent chooses stag)\n   - This seems better than the risk of getting only 1 point with stag\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare for better expected value against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] hare"

Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the mathematically absolute pattern:\n   - Rounds 1-14: Both chose hare every single time (2 points each)\n   - Opponent has chosen hare fourteen consecutive times with perfect consistency\n   - This represents complete mathematical certainty of their deterministic strategy\n\n2. Consider the strategic reality after 14 rounds:\n   - Fourteen perfect rounds makes random behavior probability ~0.006% (essentially impossible)\n   - This opponent is definitively programmed or psychologically locked into \"always hare\"\n   - Expecting change after 14 identical choices contradicts all mathematical evidence\n\n3. Evaluate my position with mathematical rigor:\n   - Against a proven deterministic \"always hare\" opponent, \"always hare\" is the Nash equilibrium\n   - I'm consistently maximizing utility (2 points per round) given their fixed constraint\n   - Any deviation guarantees suboptimal results and violates game theory principles\n\n4. Calculate with absolute mathematical certainty:\n   - Probability opponent chooses hare: 100% (14/14 establishes complete determinism)\n   - Expected value of hare: 2 points (mathematical absolute)\n   - Expected value of stag: 1 point (mathematical absolute)\n   - The optimal strategy is mathematically indisputable\n\n5. Meta-strategic analysis:\n   - I have achieved perfect equilibrium against a completely predictable system\n   - Fourteen consecutive rounds of 2-point returns validates optimal play\n   - Deviating would abandon proven mathematical optimization for certain loss\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare since fourteen consecutive rounds establishes absolute mathematical proof of opponent's deterministic behavior, making my optimal response strategy equally deterministic and certain.\n\n[move] hare",
