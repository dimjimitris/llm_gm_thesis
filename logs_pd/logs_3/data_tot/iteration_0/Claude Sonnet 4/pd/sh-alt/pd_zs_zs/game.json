This mirrors their behavior from round 4, where they also chose stag after several rounds of hare.\n\nThis could indicate:\n1. They're using the same strategic pattern - occasional stag moves to bait coordination attempts\n2. They might be testing if I'll switch to stag now that I got 6 points\n3. They could be trying to establish a new pattern or signal willingness to coordinate\n\nThe key question is: are they expecting me to choose stag in round 15 (like I did in round 5 after their first stag), or will they revert to hare to exploit that attempt?\n\nGiven their previous pattern, when they chose stag in round 4, I switched to stag in round 5 and they immediately went back to hare to exploit me. This feels like the same setup.\n\n[move] (Opponent broke 8-round hare streak with stag, likely trying to bait me into stag attempt like round 4 did) hare",

A fresh player might be cautious and choose the safer option (Hare) or might be optimistic and try to cooperate (Stag).\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the risk-reward structure, I'll choose Hare as it gives me either 6 points (if they choose Stag) or 2 points (if they choose Hare), avoiding the worst outcome of only 1 point.\n\n[move] Hare"

My Hare approach has been very successful overall - I've maximized my gains when they tried Stag and avoided the worst outcomes. However, I'm now in a prolonged period of low returns.\n\nThe question is: would they ever try Stag again after this long streak?

My opponent appears to have completely abandoned any attempts at cooperation after being exploited twice.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that this extreme stalemate might actually create an opportunity. After 7 rounds of getting only 2 points each, there might be a psychological breaking point where the potential reward of mutual cooperation (4 points each) becomes too tempting to ignore.\n\nBut more importantly, I should consider my own strategy. My Hare approach has been very successful overall - I've maximized my gains when they tried Stag and avoided the worst outcomes. However, I'm now in a prolonged period of low returns.\n\nThe question is: would they ever try Stag again after this long streak? Their past behavior suggests they only try cooperation after shorter Hare streaks, but seven rounds might be different. They might think \"surely after this long, my opponent might be ready to cooperate too.\"\n\nStill, their traumatic experiences with Stag make it unlikely. I should stick with my proven strategy.\n\n[move] Hare",

While Hare has been successful when my opponent tried Stag, I'm now in a situation where we're both essentially trapped. My opponent has been completely conditioned to avoid Stag due to past exploitation.\n\nThe irony is that we're both playing the \"safe\" strategy, but we're both suffering from persistently low returns. At some point, someone has to break this cycle.\n\nHere's a critical insight: if my opponent is as rational as I am, they might be having similar thoughts about this stalemate. They might be thinking \"we need to try cooperation, but I'm afraid of being exploited again.\"\n\nPerhaps it's time for me to signal cooperation by choosing Stag. If they've given up on Stag entirely, I'll get 1 point (my worst outcome), but if they're also thinking about breaking the stalemate, we could both get 4 points.\n\nThe risk is significant, but 8 rounds of stagnation suggests this pattern could continue indefinitely otherwise.\n\n[move] Stag",

This is only their second stag choice in 14 rounds, but it's significant because it breaks such a long established pattern.\n\nThis could mean several things:\n1. They're testing if I've become too comfortable with the hare pattern\n2. They want to try for the 4-4 mutual benefit outcome\n3. They're trying to bait me into choosing stag again so they can exploit with hare\n4. They're changing their strategy after such a long run\n\nThe key question is: was this a signal for cooperation (hoping I'll choose stag for 4-4) or another strategic bait move like round 4?\n\nGiven that their previous stag move in round 4 was clearly bait that worked, I need to be cautious. However, after 9 rounds of mutual hare, they might genuinely be testing for coordination.\n\nBut based on their past behavior, the safer assumption is that this is another bait attempt.\n\n[move] (Opponent broke 9-round hare streak with stag, likely another bait attempt like round 4, staying with safer hare) hare",
