This is a very consistent pattern that suggests they may have settled on hare as their default strategy. This makes sense from their perspective because:\n- Hare guarantees at least 2 points (never the worst outcome)\n- When the opponent tries stag (like I did in round 2), they get the maximum 6 points\n- It's a relatively safe strategy that exploits opponents who try to coordinate\n\nGiven this strong pattern of three consecutive hare choices, the probability that they'll choose hare again seems quite high. If they do choose hare again, then:\n- If I choose hare: I get 2 points\n- If I choose stag: I get 1 point (like in round 2)\n\nHowever, I should also consider that they might eventually try to switch things up, especially if they think I've caught onto their pattern.

They're alternating strategies or trying to be unpredictable\n4. They realized that always choosing hare might be too predictable\n\nThe key question now is: was this a one-time switch or are they changing their strategy? \n\nIf they're trying to signal a desire to coordinate on stag for mutual benefit (4 points each), then stag would be the right response. But if this was just a temporary deviation and they go back to hare, then I'd want to choose hare as well.\n\nGiven that they broke their pattern after three consistent rounds, there's a reasonable chance they might be testing whether we can now coordinate on the mutually beneficial stag-stag outcome.\n\n[move] (Opponent broke their hare pattern after three rounds, possibly signaling willingness to coordinate on mutual benefit) stag"

They're using the same strategic pattern - occasional stag moves to bait coordination attempts\n2. They might be testing if I'll switch to stag now that I got 6 points\n3. They could be trying to establish a new pattern or signal willingness to coordinate\n\nThe key question is: are they expecting me to choose stag in round 15 (like I did in round 5 after their first stag), or will they revert to hare to exploit that attempt?\n\nGiven their previous pattern, when they chose stag in round 4, I switched to stag in round 5 and they immediately went back to hare to exploit me.
