The risk is that if I choose stag and they stick with hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\nGiven that they showed cautious behavior in round 1, I think there's a reasonable chance they might be willing to try for the mutually beneficial outcome now that we've both demonstrated we're not immediately aggressive players.\n\n[move] (Attempting cooperation after both playing safely in round 1) stag",

The question is whether I should continue this stable but suboptimal pattern indefinitely.\n\nThere's something to be said for occasionally testing the waters with stag, even knowing I'll likely get 1 point. It's the only way to potentially break into the superior 4-4 equilibrium. But their behavior suggests they either don't understand this possibility or are completely unwilling to take any risk.\n\nHowever, I'm also wondering if there might be some psychological shift after so many rounds. Could they be getting bored with the predictable pattern? Might they finally try something different?\n\nThe evidence says no, but the potential payoff of mutual cooperation is significant.\n\n[move] (Testing for any change after 13 rounds of their unwavering pattern) stag",
