Thirteen consecutive rounds of hare with zero deviation whatsoever. My opponent appears to be operating under a completely fixed strategy that shows no capacity for change or adaptation.\n\nAt this point, I'm wondering if I should consider taking a different approach. While matching their hare strategy has been safe and profitable (2 points per round), I'm curious whether breaking the pattern might reveal something new about their strategy or potentially shock them into trying cooperation.\n\nHowever, the evidence is overwhelming. Thirteen rounds of identical behavior suggests they will choose hare again with near 100% certainty. Any deviation from hare on my part would almost certainly result in me getting 1 point while they get 6.\n\nThe mathematically sound approach remains unchanged: stick with hare to guarantee 2 points rather than risk 1 point testing a pattern that has shown zero flexibility.\n\n[move] (Maintaining successful strategy against their mechanically consistent hare play) hare"

This is now statistically extraordinary - the probability of this happening by chance if they had any variation in their strategy would be astronomically low. They are clearly following a pure hare strategy with no deviation whatsoever.\n\nI'm starting to wonder if there's any point in continuing to analyze their behavior - it's become completely predictable. They will choose hare. I know this with near certainty.\n\nThe question becomes: should I continue the safe strategy indefinitely, or is there any value in occasionally testing with stag just to see if anything changes? From a pure point maximization perspective, hare is clearly correct given their pattern.\n\nBut I'm also thinking about whether this pattern could ever be broken. The only way we could achieve the better mutual outcome of 4-4 would be if someone takes the risk first. However, their behavior suggests they never will.\n\nI'll stick with the mathematically optimal response to their demonstrated strategy.\n\n[move] (Continuing proven approach against their perfectly predictable hare strategy) hare"

At this point, their behavior has transcended predictability - it's become mechanical. They are operating with what appears to be a fixed algorithm: always choose hare, no exceptions, no learning, no adaptation.\n\nI'm now faced with an interesting philosophical question about game theory. We're locked in a stable equilibrium where we both get 2 points per round, but we're leaving a better mutual outcome (4-4) completely unexplored because neither of us is willing to risk the cooperation attempt.\n\nHowever, I already tried cooperation once in round 2 and got punished for it. Their subsequent behavior shows they learned nothing from that interaction and made no attempt to reciprocate or signal cooperation.\n\nGiven their absolutely unwavering pattern over fifteen rounds, I see no rational reason to deviate from hare. They will almost certainly choose hare again, making hare my optimal response.\n\n[move] (Maintaining equilibrium strategy against their completely inflexible hare pattern) hare"
