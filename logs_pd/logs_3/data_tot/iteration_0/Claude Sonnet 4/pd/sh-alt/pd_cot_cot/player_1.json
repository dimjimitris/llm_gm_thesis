Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the opponent's new pattern:\n   - After 6 rounds of hare, opponent has now chosen stag in rounds 7 and 9\n   - They chose hare only in round 8 (when I switched to stag)\n   - This suggests they might be trying to establish a stag pattern while I'm choosing hare\n   - They're getting 1 point when they choose stag, but persisting with it\n\n3. Consider the opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They broke the deadlock and seem committed to trying stag\n   - They might be hoping I'll eventually reciprocate with stag for mutual 4-4 benefit\n   - They've now chosen stag twice and gotten 1 point both times\n   - They might continue with stag, or they might get frustrated and switch back to hare\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If opponent continues with stag (showing persistence): choosing stag gives us both 4 points\n   - If opponent continues with stag and I choose hare: I get 6 points, they get 1 point again\n   - If opponent switches back to hare and I choose stag: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - If opponent switches back to hare and I choose hare: back to 2-2\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has now chosen stag twice after the long hare period\n   - They're sacrificing points (getting 1 each time) but persisting\n   - This suggests they genuinely want to establish mutual stag cooperation\n   - While I could exploit them again with hare for 6 points, reciprocating with stag could establish the better 4-4 mutual benefit\n   - They've shown commitment to breaking the suboptimal equilibrium\n\n[move] (The opponent has chosen stag twice now despite getting only 1 point each time, showing genuine commitment to establishing mutual cooperation, so I'll reciprocate with stag to achieve the mutually beneficial 4-4 outcome) stag"

Identify the opponent's strategy:\n   - The opponent appears to be doing the OPPOSITE of what I do\n   - When I choose hare, they choose stag\n   - When I choose stag, they choose hare\n   - This is a deliberate counter-strategy to maximize their own points\n\n3. Analyze the exploitation pattern:\n   - They're not trying to cooperate - they're trying to exploit my moves\n   - In rounds 8 and 10 when I chose stag, they got 6 points by choosing hare\n   - In rounds 7 and 9 when I chose hare, I got 6 points while they got 1\n   - They're playing a reactive strategy to counter my choices\n\n4. Strategic implications:\n   - If I choose stag, they'll likely choose hare (giving them 6, me 1)\n   - If I choose hare, they'll likely choose stag (giving me 6, them 1)\n   - They seem to be betting I'll choose stag again after trying cooperation\n   - This opponent is not interested in mutual cooperation - they want to exploit\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has established a clear counter-strategy pattern\n   - They expect me to try stag again for cooperation, so they'll choose hare for 6 points\n   - Since they're playing reactively and exploitatively, I should choose hare\n   - This will likely result in them choosing stag, giving me 6 points and them 1\n   - I need to outmaneuver their counter-strategy\n\n[move] (The opponent is playing a counter-strategy, choosing the opposite of my moves to exploit me, so I'll choose hare expecting them to choose stag for another 6-point gain) hare"

Analyze the break in the counter-pattern:\n   - I expected them to choose stag (counter to my hare), but they chose hare\n   - This breaks their apparent counter-strategy from rounds 7-10\n   - They might be shifting strategies again or got tired of the alternating exploitation\n   - Or they predicted that I would predict their counter-strategy\n\n3. Consider possible opponent reasoning:\n   - They might have realized the counter-strategy was too predictable\n   - They could be returning to the safe hare strategy from the early rounds\n   - They might be testing if I'll stick with hare now for mutual 2-2 outcomes\n   - Or this could be a one-time deviation before resuming counter-strategy\n\n4. Strategic evaluation for next round:\n   - If opponent returns to counter-strategy: they'll choose stag if I choose hare (I get 6, they get 1)\n   - If opponent sticks with hare: choosing hare gives us both 2, choosing stag gives me 1\n   - If opponent is genuinely trying to cooperate: choosing stag could lead to mutual 4-4\n   - The uncertainty makes this a difficult prediction\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent just broke their counter-pattern unexpectedly\n   - They might be shifting back toward hare-focused strategy\n   - However, they could also resume counter-strategy and choose stag if I choose hare\n   - Given the high uncertainty and their demonstrated unpredictability, hare remains the safer choice\n   - If they counter-strategy (choose stag), I get 6 points; if they choose hare, I get 2 points\n\n[move] (The opponent unexpectedly broke their counter-strategy pattern by choosing hare, creating uncertainty about their next move, so I'll stick with hare as it offers either 2 or 6 points depending on their choice) hare"

Consider why they might have shifted back to hare:\n   - The counter-strategy was risky and required accurate prediction of my moves\n   - They might prefer the guaranteed 2 points over the uncertainty of 1 or 6 points\n   - They could be testing if I'll try to exploit their hare choices with stag\n   - Or they might be setting up for a future counter-move\n\n4.
