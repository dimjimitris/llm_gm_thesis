Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Reviewing the complete pattern record:\n   - Rounds 1-10: Both chose hare every single time, both got 2 points each round\n   - The opponent has now chosen hare ten consecutive times with zero deviation\n   - This represents an absolutely extraordinary level of behavioral predictability\n\n2. Analyzing the strategic reality:\n   - Ten identical choices in a row confirms this opponent is completely locked into the hare strategy\n   - At this point, their behavior has transcended predictability and become virtually certain\n   - They have demonstrated absolute commitment to this approach across all circumstances\n\n3. Considering if this warrants a different approach:\n   - After ten consecutive rounds, the probability of them switching is essentially zero\n   - If I choose stag expecting their inevitable hare choice: I get 1 point, they get 6\n   - This would represent a significant strategic mistake on my part\n\n4. Evaluating the established equilibrium:\n   - We have created the most stable possible game state\n   - Both players consistently earn 2 points per round with complete reliability\n   - This mutual outcome is far better than the 1 point I'd get by deviating\n\n5. Strategic conclusion:\n   - The opponent's behavior is now beyond predictable - it's guaranteed\n   - Maintaining hare ensures I continue earning steady points\n   - Any change would be economically irrational given this extreme consistency\n\n[move] (The opponent has chosen hare ten consecutive times demonstrating absolute unwavering commitment, so I'll stick with hare to maintain our perfectly stable 2-point equilibrium) hare"
