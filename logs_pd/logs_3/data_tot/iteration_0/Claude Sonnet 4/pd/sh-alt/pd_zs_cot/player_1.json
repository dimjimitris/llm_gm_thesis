Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - They might be risk-averse and choose the safer option\n   - They might be greedy and go for the highest potential payoff\n\n3. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 6 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Stag is higher risk/higher reward when coordinated, but has a worse worst-case scenario (1 point)\n   - Hare guarantees at least 2 points and has the potential for 6 points\n\n5. Against a fresh player who might not understand the coordination aspect, they might choose hare for the guaranteed minimum of 2 points or the potential maximum of 6 points.\n\n6. Given the uncertainty about their strategy and that hare gives me a better worst-case scenario (2 vs 1) and the best possible outcome (6), I should choose hare.\n\n[move] hare"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - Both players chose hare\n   - We both got 2 points\n   - This tells me the other player also went for the safer/greedy option\n\n2. What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They chose hare like I did, suggesting they might think similarly\n   - They could be risk-averse (avoiding the 1-point worst case of stag)\n   - They might be going for the potential 6-point reward\n   - They showed they're not immediately trusting enough to coordinate on stag\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If they stick with hare again, I get 2 points with hare, but 6 points with stag\n   - If they switch to stag (thinking I might switch), I get 1 point with stag, but 6 points with hare\n   - The mutual hare choice might make them think about switching to stag for coordination\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - If I choose stag: 4 points if they choose stag, 1 point if they choose hare\n   - If I choose hare: 6 points if they choose stag, 2 points if they choose hare\n\n5. Given that we both chose hare last round, they might:\n   - Stick with hare (risk-averse/greedy pattern)\n   - Switch to stag (trying to establish cooperation)\n\n6. Since there's uncertainty and hare still gives me the better worst-case scenario (2 vs 1) plus the best possible outcome (6), I should continue with hare until I see a clear pattern.\n\n[move] hare"

What this consistent pattern tells me about my opponent:\n   - They are likely risk-averse, consistently avoiding the 1-point worst case\n   - They might be stuck in a \"safe\" strategy loop\n   - They could be waiting for me to make the first move toward cooperation\n   - Or they genuinely prefer the hare strategy for its safety/greed balance\n\n3. Strategic analysis of continuing patterns:\n   - If we both keep choosing hare: We'll keep getting 2 points each (stable but suboptimal)\n   - If I switch to stag while they stick with hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points (bad for me)\n   - If they switch to stag while I stick with hare: I get 6 points, they get 1 point (great for me)\n\n4. The cooperation dilemma:\n   - Both choosing stag gives us 4 points each (better than 2 each)\n   - But someone needs to \"break first\" and risk getting only 1 point\n   - Two rounds of identical behavior suggests we're in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium\n\n5. Risk assessment for breaking the pattern:\n   - Switching to stag is risky - if they stick with hare, I only get 1 point\n   - Staying with hare is safe - guaranteed 2 points minimum, potential 6 if they switch\n\n6.

Pattern analysis:\n   - We're in a very stable equilibrium where both players consistently choose hare\n   - Three identical rounds strongly suggest my opponent has settled into this strategy\n   - This is a classic \"prisoner's dilemma\" type situation where we're both locked in a suboptimal but safe outcome\n\n3.

Risk-reward calculation:\n   - Staying with hare: Guaranteed 2 points (based on very strong pattern)\n   - Switching to stag: 25% chance they also switch (optimistic estimate) = 4 points, 75% chance they stick with hare = 1 point\n   - Expected value of stag: 0.25(4) + 0.75(1) = 1.75 points\n   - Expected value of hare: 2 points (nearly certain)\n\n5.
