What this consistent pattern tells me about my opponent:\n   - They are likely risk-averse, consistently avoiding the 1-point worst case\n   - They might be stuck in a \"safe\" strategy loop\n   - They could be waiting for me to make the first move toward cooperation\n   - Or they genuinely prefer the hare strategy for its safety/greed balance\n\n3. Strategic analysis of continuing patterns:\n   - If we both keep choosing hare: We'll keep getting 2 points each (stable but suboptimal)\n   - If I switch to stag while they stick with hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points (bad for me)\n   - If they switch to stag while I stick with hare: I get 6 points, they get 1 point (great for me)\n\n4. The cooperation dilemma:\n   - Both choosing stag gives us 4 points each (better than 2 each)\n   - But someone needs to \"break first\" and risk getting only 1 point\n   - Two rounds of identical behavior suggests we're in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium\n\n5. Risk assessment for breaking the pattern:\n   - Switching to stag is risky - if they stick with hare, I only get 1 point\n   - Staying with hare is safe - guaranteed 2 points minimum, potential 6 if they switch\n\n6. Given the consistent pattern and my opponent's apparent risk-aversion, they're likely to choose hare again. I should stick with the safer strategy that also gives me the chance for 6 points.\n\n[move] hare"

Pattern analysis:\n   - We're in a very stable equilibrium where both players consistently choose hare\n   - Three identical rounds strongly suggest my opponent has settled into this strategy\n   - This is a classic \"prisoner's dilemma\" type situation where we're both locked in a suboptimal but safe outcome\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - Continuing with hare: Guaranteed 2 points, very predictable\n   - Switching to stag: High risk of getting only 1 point since opponent seems committed to hare\n   - The mutual cooperation outcome (both stag = 4 points each) seems unlikely given the pattern\n\n4.

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - They might be risk-averse and choose the safer option\n   - They might be greedy and go for the highest potential payoff\n\n3. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 6 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Stag is higher risk/higher reward when coordinated, but has a worse worst-case scenario (1 point)\n   - Hare guarantees at least 2 points and has the potential for 6 points\n\n5. Against a fresh player who might not understand the coordination aspect, they might choose hare for the guaranteed minimum of 2 points or the potential maximum of 6 points.\n\n6. Given the uncertainty about their strategy and that hare gives me a better worst-case scenario (2 vs 1) and the best possible outcome (6), I should choose hare.\n\n[move] hare",

What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They chose hare like I did, suggesting they might think similarly\n   - They could be risk-averse (avoiding the 1-point worst case of stag)\n   - They might be going for the potential 6-point reward\n   - They showed they're not immediately trusting enough to coordinate on stag\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If they stick with hare again, I get 2 points with hare, but 6 points with stag\n   - If they switch to stag (thinking I might switch), I get 1 point with stag, but 6 points with hare\n   - The mutual hare choice might make them think about switching to stag for coordination\n\n4.

Given that we both chose hare last round, they might:\n   - Stick with hare (risk-averse/greedy pattern)\n   - Switch to stag (trying to establish cooperation)\n\n6.
