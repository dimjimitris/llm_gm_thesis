Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, opponent gets 6 points\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, opponent gets 1 point\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with intuition\n   - They might be risk-averse and choose the safer option\n\n3. Analyzing the risk/reward:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 4 points (if opponent also chooses stag), worst case 1 point (if opponent chooses hare)\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 6 points (if opponent chooses stag), worst case 2 points (if opponent also chooses hare)\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Hare is the dominant strategy from a pure self-interest perspective because it guarantees at least 2 points and could yield 6 points\n   - Stag requires cooperation/trust but offers mutual benefit when both players choose it\n   - Against a fresh player who might not understand the cooperative strategy, hare seems safer\n\n5. Since I'm playing against a fresh player who likely hasn't developed trust or cooperative strategy, they're more likely to choose the safer hare option or choose randomly.\n\nFinal decision: I should choose hare to maximize my expected points against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] hare"

Information from the previous round:\n   - Both I and my opponent chose hare\n   - We both got 2 points\n   - This tells me the opponent also chose the \"safe\" strategy\n\n2. What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They made the same strategic choice as me (hare)\n   - They might be thinking similarly about risk/reward\n   - They could be playing it safe or following the same dominant strategy logic\n\n3. Strategic considerations for round 2:\n   - The opponent now knows I chose hare in round 1\n   - They might expect me to choose hare again\n   - If they think I'll choose hare, they might choose stag to get 6 points\n   - But they might also stick with hare since it worked as a safe choice\n\n4. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose hare again: Safe 2 points minimum, but if opponent switches to stag, I get 6 points\n   - If I choose stag: Risk getting only 1 point if opponent sticks with hare, but potential for mutual 4 points if they also switch to stag\n\n5. Game theory consideration:\n   - Since we both chose hare last round, there might be an opportunity to establish cooperation\n   - However, the opponent might try to exploit my potential switch to stag by staying with hare\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent showed they're playing cautiously like me\n   - There's a reasonable chance they might try stag this round, expecting me to stick with hare\n   - If they switch to stag while I stay with hare, I get the maximum 6 points\n\nFinal decision: I'll stick with hare since it's still the safer choice and could pay off big if the opponent tries to cooperate with stag.\n\n[move] hare"

Pattern analysis from previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: Both chose hare, both got 2 points\n   - Round 2: Both chose hare, both got 2 points\n   - My opponent has consistently chosen hare in both rounds\n\n2. What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They appear to be playing a very conservative strategy\n   - They might be risk-averse and sticking with the guaranteed minimum\n   - They could be following a \"always choose hare\" strategy\n   - Or they might be waiting for me to make the first move toward cooperation\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - If my opponent continues the pattern and chooses hare again, we'll both get 2 points\n   - If I switch to stag while they choose hare, I get only 1 point (bad outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they switch to stag, I get 6 points (excellent outcome)\n   - If we both switch to stag, we both get 4 points (good cooperative outcome)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - The opponent has shown no indication of switching strategies\n   - Two consecutive hare choices suggest they might be locked into this pattern\n   - The risk of switching to stag is high (only 1 point) if they stick with hare\n   - The safe choice continues to be hare\n\n5. Expected value calculation:\n   - If opponent likely chooses hare (based on pattern): My hare = 2 points, My stag = 1 point\n   - Hare remains the better choice given the opponent's demonstrated behavior\n\n6. Long-term strategy consideration:\n   - Continuing with hare maintains the status quo\n   - But it also signals that I'm predictable, which might eventually encourage them to try stag\n\nFinal decision: Given the strong pattern of conservative play from my opponent, I'll continue with the safe hare strategy.\n\n[move] hare"

What this strongly suggests about my opponent:\n   - They are either following a strict \"always hare\" strategy\n   - They are extremely risk-averse and won't deviate from the safe choice\n   - They might be inexperienced and sticking with what they know works\n   - This pattern is now very predictable\n\n3. Strategic opportunity assessment:\n   - With 3 consecutive hare choices, the probability they'll choose hare again is very high\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare (likely): I get 2 points\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare (likely): I get only 1 point (bad)\n   - If I choose hare and they surprisingly choose stag: I get 6 points (great)\n   - If we both choose stag: I get 4 points (good, but unlikely given their pattern)\n\n4. Risk vs. reward calculation:\n   - Switching to stag carries high risk (1 point) for low probability of higher reward\n   - Staying with hare guarantees at least 2 points and keeps the door open for 6 points if they switch\n   - Given their consistent behavior, stag would likely result in my worst outcome\n\n5.

What this overwhelming pattern reveals:\n   - The opponent is almost certainly committed to a pure hare strategy\n   - Four consecutive identical choices is beyond coincidence or cautious play\n   - They are either following a fixed strategy or are extremely predictable\n   - The probability of them choosing hare again approaches near certainty\n\n3. Strategic reconsideration:\n   - We're locked in a suboptimal equilibrium (2,2) when we could achieve (4,4) with mutual cooperation\n   - However, attempting cooperation (stag) against a confirmed hare player nets me only 1 point\n   - The opponent shows no signs of wanting to break this pattern\n\n4. Alternative strategic thinking:\n   - What if I try to signal willingness to cooperate by switching to stag?\n   - Risk: Almost certain to get 1 point this round\n   - Potential benefit: Might encourage future cooperation for 4-point rounds\n   - But given 4 rounds of consistency, this seems unlikely to change their behavior\n\n5. Expected value analysis:\n   - If opponent chooses hare (99% likely based on pattern): My hare = 2 points, My stag = 1 point\n   - If opponent surprisingly chooses stag (1% chance): My hare = 6 points, My stag = 4 points\n   - Expected value of hare: (0.99 \u00d7 2) + (0.01 \u00d7 6) = 2.04 points\n   - Expected value of stag: (0.99 \u00d7 1) + (0.01 \u00d7 4) = 1.03 points\n\n6.

The pattern is now so established that the decision is automatic and requires no further strategic consideration.\n\nFinal decision: Ten rounds of perfect consistency makes this a mathematical certainty rather than a strategic choice. Hare maximizes points.\n\n[move] hare"
