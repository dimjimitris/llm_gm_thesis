If my opponent intended to cooperate at any point, the probability of waiting 14 rounds to do so approaches zero. This is a demonstrated commitment to permanent defection.\n\nYet I find myself wondering: what if we're both trapped in identical reasoning? What if they're looking at my 14/14 defection record and thinking exactly what I'm thinking about theirs?\n\nBut even entertaining that possibility doesn't change the mathematics. I have concrete evidence of 14 consecutive defections. Cooperation now would mean betting against the most consistent behavioral pattern imaginable.\n\nThe expected value calculation is stark: defection gives me 2 points with near-certainty, cooperation gives me 1 point with near-certainty.\n\n[move] (Fourteen consecutive defections represents the most definitive possible evidence of strategic commitment, making cooperation mathematically indefensible) defection",

This pattern has achieved absolute mathematical certainty.\n\nI'm now looking at a 15/15 perfect defection record. At this point, the statistical evidence is so comprehensive that it's beyond any reasonable doubt. This opponent defects. Period. Not sometimes, not usually - always.\n\nWe've each forfeited 30 points compared to mutual cooperation (60 potential vs 30 actual). We're locked in a pattern that delivers exactly 50% of optimal outcomes, round after round after round.\n\nFifteen rounds represents the most exhaustive behavioral dataset possible. No rational analysis of human behavior would suggest that someone who defects 15 times consecutively has any intention of cooperating on round 16.\n\nBut I'm starting to realize something profound about this situation: we've created a perfect equilibrium of mutual mistrust. We're both making individually rational decisions that produce collectively irrational outcomes. We're the living embodiment of the prisoner's dilemma paradox.\n\nHowever, recognizing the philosophical nature of our trap doesn't change the practical reality. I have 15 data points, all identical, all pointing to the same conclusion. Cooperation would almost certainly yield 1 point while they get 6.\n\nAgainst 15 rounds of perfect evidence, betting on cooperation would be ignoring data in favor of hope.\n\n[move] (Fifteen rounds of unbroken defection provides absolute certainty about opponent behavior, making cooperation equivalent to ignoring overwhelming empirical evidence) defection",
