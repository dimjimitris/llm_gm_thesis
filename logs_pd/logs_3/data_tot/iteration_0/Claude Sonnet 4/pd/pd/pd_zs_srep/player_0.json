Not \"probably will\" or \"likely will\" - they WILL defect. Twelve rounds of identical behavior with zero deviation is not a pattern, it's a proven strategy.\n\nFrom a decision theory perspective, I'm facing a choice with known probabilities:\n- If I defect: ~100% chance of 2 points\n- If I cooperate: ~100% chance of 1 point (and they get 6)\n\nThere's no reasonable game theory framework that would suggest cooperation after observing 12 consecutive defections. This would be ignoring empirical evidence in favor of wishful thinking.\n\nThe opponent has communicated their strategy more clearly than words ever could: they always defect.\n\n[move] (Twelve consecutive defections represents absolute behavioral certainty that cooperation would result in immediate exploitation with near-zero chance of reciprocation) defection"

This is now beyond any reasonable threshold of statistical significance.\n\nI'm staring at a 13/13 perfect defection record. In probability terms, if my opponent had even a 50% chance of cooperating in any given round, the odds of 13 straight defections would be roughly 1 in 8,192. If they had a 90% chance of cooperating, it would be astronomically unlikely.\n\nWe've each lost 26 points compared to mutual cooperation (52 potential vs 26 actual). We're operating at exactly 50% efficiency compared to the optimal outcome.\n\nBut I think I need to step back and consider something important: am I contributing to a mutual trap? The reality is that I've also defected 13 times in a row. From their perspective, I look exactly like they look to me - completely committed to defection.\n\nHowever, this doesn't change the fundamental calculus. Regardless of the philosophical implications, I have 13 rounds of perfect evidence about what my opponent will do. They have never cooperated, not once, across 13 distinct opportunities.\n\nCooperating now would be ignoring the most comprehensive behavioral dataset possible in favor of hope over evidence.

We're systematically achieving exactly half of our potential in every single round.\n\nFourteen rounds of identical behavior represents the most definitive behavioral data possible. If my opponent intended to cooperate at any point, the probability of waiting 14 rounds to do so approaches zero.

We're both making individually rational decisions that produce collectively irrational outcomes. We're the living embodiment of the prisoner's dilemma paradox.\n\nHowever, recognizing the philosophical nature of our trap doesn't change the practical reality.
