The pattern is now extremely well-established. My opponent has shown complete commitment to defection for the vast majority of the game.\n\nWe remain locked in the mutual defection equilibrium. Given the overwhelming evidence of my opponent's strategy, there is no rational reason to deviate from defection, which continues to be my best response to their consistent defection.\n\n[move] (Eight rounds of mutual defection confirms the locked equilibrium with no indication of strategy change from opponent) defection"
