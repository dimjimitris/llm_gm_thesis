Reviewing the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-3: Both defected, both got 2 points each\n   - Round 4: I defected, opponent cooperated, I got 6 points\n   - Rounds 5-15: Both defected, both got 2 points each\n   - We now have 14 out of 15 rounds of mutual defection\n\n2. Analyzing the absolutely fixed pattern:\n   - The opponent's single cooperation attempt was 11 rounds ago\n   - They have defected consistently for 11 straight rounds since then\n   - The mutual defection equilibrium is at absolute maximum stability\n   - The opponent's strategy is completely and utterly predictable\n\n3. Considering the strategic landscape:\n   - We're in a perfectly stable, mathematically determined cycle\n   - The opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment for 11 consecutive rounds\n   - Both players are earning exactly 2 points per round with absolute certainty\n   - The pattern has reached ultimate mathematical stability\n\n4. Evaluating potential moves:\n   - Defection: Absolutely guaranteed 2 points against their certain defection\n   - Cooperation: Virtually guaranteed 1 point given their 11-round streak of unwavering defection\n   - The opponent has shown complete strategic rigidity for nearly three-quarters of our entire game\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - After 11 consecutive rounds of mutual defection, the game has achieved maximum predictability\n   - The opponent has completely abandoned any strategic flexibility\n   - My defection strategy has been perfectly validated for an extended period\n   - Any deviation would be completely irrational given the mathematical certainty of outcomes\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will choose defection as the pattern has achieved absolute stability and the opponent shows complete strategic immutability over 11 consecutive rounds.\n\n[move] (With 11 consecutive rounds of mutual defection, the opponent has demonstrated absolute strategic commitment with zero variation) defection",
