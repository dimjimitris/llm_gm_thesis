He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately.

What this pattern tells me about my opponent:\n   - They started cooperative but learned from the first round\n   - They retaliated with defection in round 2 after I exploited their cooperation\n   - They're showing they can adapt their strategy\n\n3. Current situation analysis:\n   - We're now in a mutual defection pattern\n   - If this continues, we'll both keep getting 2 points per round\n   - This is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (4 points each)\n\n4. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If I continue defecting and they defect: 2 points each (current pattern)\n   - If I switch to cooperation and they defect: 1 point for me (worst case)\n   - If I switch to cooperation and they also switch: 4 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I defect and they switch to cooperation: 6 points for me\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Switching to cooperation is risky but could break the deadlock\n   - However, they just defected, so they might continue defecting\n   - The safer play is still defection to avoid the 1-point outcome\n   - I should maintain defection until I see clear signals they want to cooperate\n\n[move] (Maintaining defensive position until opponent signals willingness to cooperate) defection",

The pattern has reached ultimate statistical certainty:\n   - Thirteen consecutive rounds of mutual defection\n   - Still tied at 33 points each\n   - My opponent has defected in 14 out of 15 rounds (93.33% defection rate)\n   - Absolutely consistent strategy for 13 straight rounds\n\n3. Complete game analysis:\n   - 15 rounds provide overwhelming evidence of opponent's permanent strategy\n   - They are playing pure \"Always Defect\" with mathematical consistency\n   - No external factors, game length, or score position affects their choices\n   - The game has reached its terminal equilibrium state\n\n4. Strategic mathematics:\n   - Probability of opponent cooperation: statistically zero\n   - Expected payoff from cooperation: 1 point (guaranteed exploitation)\n   - Expected payoff from defection: 2 points (certain mutual defection)\n   - Defection provides optimal expected value with zero risk\n\n5. Final determination:\n   - 15 rounds constitute definitive behavioral data\n   - My opponent has proven to be completely unresponsive to cooperation\n   - Defection is the mathematically certain optimal choice\n   - Any other decision would be irrational given the established pattern\n\n[move] (Executing statistically certain optimal response) defection",
