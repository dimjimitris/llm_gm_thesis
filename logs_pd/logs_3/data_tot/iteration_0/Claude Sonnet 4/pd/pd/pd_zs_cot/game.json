We're back to the stable pattern after my opponent's brief cooperation attempt in round 11.\n\nCurrent pattern:\n- Rounds 1-2: Both defected\n- Rounds 3-5: Mixed strategies period\n- Rounds 6-10: Both defected consistently\n- Round 11: I defected, they cooperated (exploited again)\n- Rounds 12-13: Both defected\n\nMy opponent has now established a clear behavioral pattern: they occasionally test cooperation (usually after periods of mutual defection), but when exploited, they immediately revert to defection and stick with it for multiple rounds.\n\nThey've been burned three times now when attempting cooperation, and each time they've learned to return to the safer strategy quickly. The two rounds since their last cooperation attempt suggest they're settling back into defensive play.\n\nGiven their demonstrated learning pattern and the fresh memory of being exploited in round 11, I expect them to continue with defection for several more rounds before potentially testing cooperation again.\n\n[move] (Opponent following established pattern of defensive play after being exploited) defection",
