Previously, they defected for 5 rounds (6-10) after the mixed strategy period, and now they're building another streak of defensive play.\n\nTheir pattern suggests they need time to \"recover\" from being exploited before they're willing to risk cooperation again. Three rounds of mutual defection isn't enough time based on their previous behavior - they seem to need longer periods of stability before testing cooperation.\n\nThe established equilibrium of mutual defection remains the most predictable outcome for the near term.\n\n[move] (Opponent in defensive mode after exploitation, pattern suggests continued defection) defection"

After being exploited in round 11, they've now been in defensive mode for 4 rounds. Their previous defensive streak lasted 5 rounds (6-10), so if the pattern holds, they might be getting close to another cooperation attempt, though it could still be a round or more away.\n\nHowever, each time they've been exploited (3 times total now), they seem to become more cautious. The defensive periods might be getting longer as they learn that cooperation consistently leads to exploitation in this game.\n\nFor now, the safe prediction is continued mutual defection.\n\n[move] (Four rounds of defensive play, opponent may be becoming more cautious after repeated exploitation) defection"
