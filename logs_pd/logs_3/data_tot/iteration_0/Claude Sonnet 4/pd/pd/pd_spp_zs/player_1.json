The pattern is now completely absolute - my opponent has chosen defection in every single round across fourteen consecutive opportunities without any deviation. We've each accumulated 28 points when we could have earned 56 through cooperation.\n\nAt this stage, the behavioral evidence has reached maximum certainty. Fourteen consecutive identical decisions represents the strongest possible predictor of future behavior. My opponent has demonstrated complete and unwavering commitment to the defection strategy across fourteen separate decision points.\n\nThe pattern is so established that it would be mathematically irrational to expect any change. My opponent has had fourteen opportunities to signal cooperation, break the cycle, or try any alternative strategy, and they have chosen defection every single time without exception.\n\nGiven this level of behavioral certainty, attempting cooperation would be guaranteed to result in the worst possible outcome for me - 1 point while they get 6. The evidence is simply too overwhelming to ignore.\n\n[move] (Fourteen consecutive rounds of defection provides absolute certainty about my opponent's strategy commitment) defection"

            "text": "This is a shocking development! After fourteen consecutive rounds of mutual defection, my opponent suddenly chose cooperation while I chose defection. I scored 6 points (my best possible outcome) while they got 1 point (their worst possible outcome).\n\nThis completely changes the game dynamics. My opponent has broken the established pattern in a dramatic way. This could mean several things:\n1. They're signaling a willingness to try cooperation going forward\n2. They're testing whether I might reciprocate cooperation in future rounds\n3. They made a strategic decision to sacrifice one round to potentially unlock better mutual outcomes\n4. They're frustrated with the suboptimal equilibrium we've been stuck in\n\nThe question now is whether this was a one-time signal or the beginning of a cooperative strategy. If they continue with cooperation and I continue with defection, I'll keep getting 6 points while they get 1. But if they return to defection after this attempt, we'll be back to mutual defection.\n\nHowever, there's also the possibility that they're genuinely trying to establish mutual cooperation, which would give us both 4 points per round instead of 2.\n\nGiven this dramatic change, I need to consider whether to reciprocate their cooperative signal.\n\n[move] (My opponent just broke a 14-round defection pattern by cooperating, but I need to see if they'll continue this new strategy before risking cooperation myself) defection"
