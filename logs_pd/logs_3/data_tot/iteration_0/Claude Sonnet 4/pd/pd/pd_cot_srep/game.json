He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player.

Analyze the strategic situation:\n   - This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma game\n   - If I knew the opponent would cooperate, I should defect (6 > 4 points)\n   - If I knew the opponent would defect, I should also defect (2 > 1 points)\n   - Defection dominates cooperation regardless of opponent's choice\n\n3. Consider that this is against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player might not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might cooperate initially, thinking it's the \"nice\" thing to do\n   - This could be an opportunity to gain maximum points\n\n4. Evaluate my best response:\n   - Defecting gives me either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 2 points (if they defect)\n   - Cooperating gives me either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect)\n   - Defection has a higher minimum payoff and higher maximum payoff\n\n5.
