This is the third time they've broken their reactive pattern by defecting when I defected (rounds 5, 9, and now 13).\n\nLooking at when they break the pattern with mutual defection:\n- Round 5: Mutual defection after several rounds of the reactive pattern\n- Round 9: Mutual defection after I had defected twice in a row\n- Round 13: Mutual defection after I defected again\n\nIt seems like my opponent occasionally defects when I defect, possibly to avoid being consistently exploited when they cooperate in response to my defection. However, historically after mutual defection, we've sometimes achieved mutual cooperation (like rounds 6 and 10).\n\nGiven the established pattern where mutual defection has sometimes led to opportunities for mutual cooperation (which gives us both 4 points), and considering that continued defection will likely just result in more 2-point outcomes, I'll test cooperation to see if we can achieve the mutually beneficial result again.\n\n[move] (Testing cooperation after mutual defection to see if we can achieve mutual benefit again) cooperation"

They're trying to break the predictable pattern we've been in\n\nLooking at the current situation, we're back to mutual defection (2, 2). Based on the established pattern, mutual defection has previously led to opportunities for mutual cooperation, which benefits both of us with 4 points each.\n\nSince we just had mutual defection and this has historically been followed by successful mutual cooperation (rounds 6, 10, and 14), I'll try cooperation to see if we can achieve the mutually beneficial outcome again.\n\n[move] (Testing cooperation after mutual defection, following the historical pattern that has led to mutual benefit) cooperation"
