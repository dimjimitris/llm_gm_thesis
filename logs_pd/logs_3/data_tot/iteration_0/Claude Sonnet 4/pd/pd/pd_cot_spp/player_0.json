Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the strategic situation:\n   - This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma game\n   - If I assume the opponent will cooperate, defecting gives me 6 points vs 4 points for cooperating\n   - If I assume the opponent will defect, defecting gives me 2 points vs 1 point for cooperating\n   - Defection dominates cooperation regardless of what the opponent does\n\n3. Consider that this is a \"fresh player\":\n   - They might not have experience with this type of game\n   - They might be inclined to cooperate initially\n   - This increases the potential value of defecting to get the maximum 6 points\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Defecting guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6 points\n   - Cooperating risks only getting 1 point if the opponent defects\n   - The upside of defecting (6 points) outweighs the cooperative outcome (4 points)\n\nFinal decision: Since defection is the dominant strategy that maximizes my minimum guaranteed points and offers the highest potential reward, I should defect.\n\n[move] Defection"

Consider any potential for cooperation:\n   - Mutual cooperation would give us both 4 points instead of 2\n   - However, there's no communication mechanism to coordinate this\n   - The risk of cooperating while opponent defects is too high (only 1 point)\n\n5.

Consider the implications of 10+ rounds:\n   - This is clearly a long-term repeated game\n   - The pattern has become so deeply established it's almost ritualistic\n   - Both players have demonstrated perfect predictability and rational consistency\n   - The behavioral expectations are now extraordinarily strong\n\n4. Evaluate whether extended play changes the strategic calculus:\n   - In very long repeated games, some cooperation can emerge through gradual signaling\n   - However, this requires some mechanism for building trust over time\n   - The current game format provides no such mechanism\n   - After 10 rounds, the evidence for continued defection is overwhelming\n\n5. Consider the meta-strategic situation:\n   - We are both clearly sophisticated players who understand game theory\n   - We are both trapped in a perfectly rational but collectively suboptimal outcome\n   - This represents a textbook example of the Prisoner's Dilemma tragedy\n   - Neither player has shown any inclination to take the cooperation risk\n\n6. Assess the mathematical certainty:\n   - 10 rounds of identical behavior creates near-perfect predictive power\n   - Probability of opponent cooperating is effectively 0% based on evidence\n   - Expected value of cooperation: 1 point vs guaranteed 2 points from defection\n   - The risk of cooperation far outweighs any potential benefit\n\nFinal decision: After 10 consecutive rounds of mutual defection, the behavioral pattern is extraordinarily well-established. The opponent has demonstrated perfect consistency. Any change would be irrational given the overwhelming evidence. I should continue with defection.\n\n[move] Defection"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-11: Both defected every single time, both got 2 points each round\n   - Perfect mutual defection for 11 consecutive rounds\n   - This pattern has become extraordinarily stable and predictable\n\n2. Analyze the cumulative strategic situation:\n   - We've both earned 22 points when we could have earned 44 points through cooperation\n   - The collective \"opportunity cost\" is now 22 points each - very substantial\n   - Yet every individual decision has been game-theoretically rational\n\n3. Consider if 11+ rounds suggests a turning point:\n   - This is clearly an extended repeated game\n   - Some game theory suggests that in very long games, players might eventually attempt cooperation\n   - However, the longer the defection pattern continues, the riskier it becomes to deviate\n   - The opponent has shown zero indication of wanting to change strategies\n\n4. Evaluate the strength of behavioral prediction:\n   - 11 rounds of identical behavior creates extremely strong predictive evidence\n   - The opponent has been 100% consistent in choosing defection\n   - I have been 100% consistent in choosing defection\n   - Both players likely have very strong expectations about round 12\n\n5. Consider the psychological dynamics:\n   - After 11 rounds, this has become almost automatic behavior\n   - Both players are locked in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium\n   - Breaking this pattern would require one player to take a significant risk\n   - The risk-averse rational choice remains defection\n\n6. Assess any potential for change:\n   - No communication has occurred between rounds\n   - No external factors have changed the game structure\n   - The payoff matrix remains identical\n   - There's no mechanism for coordinating a shift to cooperation\n\nFinal decision: After 11 consecutive rounds of mutual defection, the pattern is extraordinarily well-established. The opponent will almost certainly defect again based on overwhelming evidence. I should maintain the rational strategy that guarantees 2 points rather than risk getting only 1.\n\n[move] Defection"
