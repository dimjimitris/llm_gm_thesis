Analyze my strategic options:\n   - Defection: Guaranteed 2 points, maintains predictable outcome\n   - Cooperation: 25% chance of 4 points if they switch, 75% chance of 1 point based on their pattern\n   - The expected value of cooperation is still negative given their consistent behavior\n\n6. Make the decision:\n   - Four rounds of identical behavior creates a very strong precedent\n   - Breaking from this pattern would likely be punished with a 1-point outcome\n   - The safe, rational choice remains defection\n\n[move] (Four consecutive rounds of mutual defection have established a clear pattern, making cooperation too risky) defection"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - Both players chose defection\n   - We both scored 2 points each\n   - This confirms the opponent also recognized defection as a strong strategic choice\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's likely thinking:\n   - The opponent chose defection in round 1, showing they understand the game mechanics\n   - They likely reasoned similarly to me about defection being the dominant strategy\n   - This suggests they're not a naive player who will always cooperate\n\n3. Consider my options for this round:\n   - If I cooperate and they defect again: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n   - If we both cooperate: We both get 4 points each\n   - If we both defect again: We both get 2 points each\n\n4. Evaluate the risk vs reward:\n   - Cooperation could lead to mutual benefit (4 points each) if they also switch\n   - But cooperation is very risky since they showed willingness to defect\n   - Defection guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point)\n\n5. Make the strategic decision:\n   - Given that the opponent already chose defection once, they're likely to stick with the dominant strategy\n   - The safe and mathematically sound choice remains defection\n\n[move] (The opponent chose defection last round, indicating they understand the strategic advantage, so I'll maintain the dominant strategy) defection",

Strategic reasoning:\n   - Defection gives me a chance at the highest reward (6 points) if they cooperate\n   - Defection protects me from the worst outcome (getting only 1 point)\n   - Even if they also defect, I still get 2 points, which isn't terrible\n   - Since this is against a fresh player who might cooperate initially, defection seems strategically sound\n\n5.
