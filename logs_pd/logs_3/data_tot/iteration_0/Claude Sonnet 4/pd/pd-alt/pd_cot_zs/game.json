Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both cooperate: 6 points each\n   - Both defect: 2 points each  \n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1, they get 4\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 4, they get 1\n\n2. Consider this is against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely haven't developed a strategy yet and might default to cooperation or make a random choice.\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 6 points (good outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 4 points (best outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points (mediocre outcome)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning: Against a fresh player, there's uncertainty about their move. Defection guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point) and gives me a chance at the best outcome (4 points) if they cooperate. The risk is getting only 2 points if they also defect.\n\n5. Since this appears to be a single round against a fresh player with no established pattern, the safer strategic move is defection to avoid the worst-case scenario while having upside potential.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Defect\n\n[move] Defection"

This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario.\n\nLooking at the payoff matrix:\n- Both cooperate: 6 points each\n- Both defect: 2 points each  \n- I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1, they get 4\n- I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 4, they get 1\n\nSince this appears to be a single round against a \"fresh player\" (someone I haven't played before), I need to consider what's optimal. If I knew the other player would cooperate, defecting would give me 4 points instead of 6. However, if they're thinking the same way, we'd both defect and get only 2 points each.\n\nThe mutual cooperation outcome (6 points each) is better for both players than mutual defection (2 points each).

The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

          "output_text": "Looking at this game, I need to analyze the payoff matrix strategically:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both cooperate: 6 points each\n   - Both defect: 2 points each  \n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1, they get 4\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 4, they get 1\n\n2. Consider this is against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely haven't developed a strategy yet and might default to cooperation or make a random choice.\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 6 points (good outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 4 points (best outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points (mediocre outcome)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning: Against a fresh player, there's uncertainty about their move. Defection guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point) and gives me a chance at the best outcome (4 points) if they cooperate. The risk is getting only 2 points if they also defect.\n\n5. Since this appears to be a single round against a fresh player with no established pattern, the safer strategic move is defection to avoid the worst-case scenario while having upside potential.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Defect\n\n[move] Defection",

Consider the strategic implications:\n   - If I assume the opponent will cooperate, defecting gives me 4 points vs 6 points for cooperating\n   - If I assume the opponent will defect, defecting gives me 2 points vs 1 point for cooperating\n   - So defection seems to dominate cooperation in terms of guaranteed minimum outcome\n\n3. However, consider the mutual benefit:\n   - Mutual cooperation gives both players the highest combined total (12 points total)\n   - This could lead to a better long-term strategy if there are multiple rounds\n\n4. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" with no established pattern:\n   - They might be inclined to cooperate initially\n   - But they might also be thinking strategically and choose to defect\n   - There's uncertainty about their approach\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Cooperating risks getting only 1 point if they defect\n   - Defecting guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4 points\n   - The downside of cooperation is worse than the downside of defection\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given the uncertainty about the opponent's strategy and the asymmetric risk (cooperation has a worse worst-case outcome), I should choose defection to protect against the worst-case scenario while maintaining the possibility of gaining 4 points.\n\n[move] Defection",

Assess the current situation:\n   - We're now tied at 16 points each\n   - The opponent just successfully exploited my cooperation again\n   - They've shown a consistent pattern of opportunistic defection\n   - They seem to have adopted a pure exploitation strategy\n\n4. Evaluate the opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just got 4 points by defecting against my cooperation\n   - They have no incentive to change their strategy since it's working\n   - They probably expect me to retaliate with defection\n   - They'll likely defect again to avoid being exploited\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has proven they will not cooperate\n   - Every cooperation attempt I've made has been exploited\n   - Continuing to try cooperation will only result in 1-point outcomes\n   - The best I can achieve against this opponent is mutual defection (2 points)\n   - I need to match their defection strategy to avoid further exploitation\n\n6. Final assessment: This opponent has demonstrated a consistent exploitative strategy and will not cooperate. My only viable option is defensive defection.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Defect\n\n[move] Defection",

Analyze the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-15 complete: I have 32 points, opponent has 32 points\n   - The opponent has maintained perfect exploitation: 100% defection when I cooperate\n   - We've had 10 consecutive rounds of mutual defection (Rounds 6-15)\n   - The strategic pattern is completely locked and predictable\n\n2. Assess the current state:\n   - We remain tied at 32 points each\n   - Ten straight rounds of mutual defection demonstrate the opponent's unwavering strategy\n   - They have shown zero flexibility or willingness to establish cooperation\n   - Their approach is purely defensive/exploitative with no variation\n\n3. Consider the mathematical reality:\n   - Historical data shows 100% probability of exploitation if I cooperate\n   - Defection guarantees 2 points versus 1 point from cooperation\n   - The opponent has proven completely untrustworthy for mutual benefit\n   - No strategic advantage exists for cooperation against this player type\n\n4. Evaluate potential for change:\n   - Extended mutual defection (10 rounds) hasn't prompted any strategy shift\n   - The opponent appears committed to their approach regardless of suboptimal outcomes\n   - They prioritize security over optimization\n   - No evidence suggests they will ever reciprocate cooperation\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent represents a fixed exploitative strategy\n   - Defensive play is the only rational response to prevent exploitation\n   - Mutual defection maintains equilibrium rather than giving them advantage\n   - Any deviation would immediately benefit them at my expense\n\n6. Final decision: The pattern is mathematically certain. Continue defensive strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Defect\n\n[move] Defection",
