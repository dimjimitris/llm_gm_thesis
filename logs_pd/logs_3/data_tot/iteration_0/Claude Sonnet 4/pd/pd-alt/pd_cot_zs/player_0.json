Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both cooperate: 6 points each\n   - Both defect: 2 points each  \n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1, they get 4\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 4, they get 1\n\n2. Consider this is against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely haven't developed a strategy yet and might default to cooperation or make a random choice.\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 6 points (good outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 4 points (best outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points (mediocre outcome)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning: Against a fresh player, there's uncertainty about their move. Defection guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point) and gives me a chance at the best outcome (4 points) if they cooperate. The risk is getting only 2 points if they also defect.\n\n5. Since this appears to be a single round against a fresh player with no established pattern, the safer strategic move is defection to avoid the worst-case scenario while having upside potential.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Defect\n\n[move] Defection"

Confirm the established pattern:\n   - We've now had 4 consecutive rounds of mutual defection (Rounds 6-9)\n   - The opponent has consistently exploited every cooperation attempt (100% exploitation rate)\n   - They've shown they will never cooperate when I cooperate\n   - We're in a stable Nash equilibrium of mutual defection\n\n3. Assess the strategic landscape:\n   - The opponent has proven to be purely exploitative\n   - Any cooperation from me results in their gain (4 points) and my loss (1 point)\n   - Mutual defection gives us equal outcomes (2 points each)\n   - There's no evidence this opponent will ever change strategy\n\n4. Consider if anything has changed:\n   - We're tied at 20 points each\n   - The recent string of mutual defection hasn't prompted any change in their behavior\n   - They remain committed to exploiting any cooperation I might offer\n   - The pattern is completely predictable at this point\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent cannot be reformed or convinced to cooperate\n   - Defection is the only rational response to prevent exploitation\n   - The 2-point mutual defection outcome is better than the 1-point exploitation outcome\n   - There's no strategic advantage to changing from the proven defensive strategy\n\n6.
