Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the current deadlock:\n   - Three consecutive rounds of mutual defection (rounds 6, 7, 8)\n   - We're both stuck getting 2 points per round\n   - This is clearly suboptimal for both players\n\n3.

Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - The opponent has now committed to defection for 3 straight rounds\n   - This suggests they might be as frustrated with the low payoffs as I am\n   - They may be waiting for me to make the first cooperative move\n   - But they've also shown they'll exploit cooperation when I offer it\n\n5. Consider the risk-reward calculation:\n   - Cooperate: Either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect)\n   - Defect: Either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 2 points (if they defect)\n   - Given their recent defection pattern, defecting seems safer\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - We're perfectly tied and getting nowhere with mutual defection\n   - The opponent might be as ready for a change as I am\n   - However, they've exploited my cooperation twice before\n   - Three rounds of mutual defection might not be enough to trust them yet\n   - I need more evidence they're truly ready to cooperate\n\n7. Decision rationale:\n   - While mutual cooperation would be ideal, the opponent has a history of exploitation\n   - Three rounds of mutual defection isn't enough to overcome their past betrayals\n   - I'll continue defecting until I see stronger signals they want to cooperate\n   - Better to get 2 points safely than risk 1 point again\n\n[move] (Three rounds of mutual defection shows we're in a deadlock, but my opponent has exploited cooperation before, so I'll maintain defection for safety) defection"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I finally broke the deadlock by cooperating after 8 rounds of mutual defection\n   - My opponent immediately exploited this cooperation, just like in rounds 1 and 4\n   - They are now ahead by 3 points (32 vs 29)\n   - This is the THIRD time they've exploited my cooperation\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's true strategy:\n   - They have now exploited cooperation in rounds 1, 4, and 14\n   - Every single time I've cooperated, they've defected\n   - The 8 rounds of mutual defection was NOT a signal of readiness to cooperate\n   - It was simply their response to my defection, maintaining their exploitative pattern\n\n4. Understand the manipulation:\n   - My opponent appears to play a consistent strategy: exploit cooperation whenever possible\n   - They only cooperated when I defected (rounds 3 and 5), likely to lure me back to cooperation\n   - The long mutual defection period was just them waiting for me to break first\n   - They've successfully manipulated me three times now\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic error:\n   - I fell for their trap again despite clear historical evidence\n   - I misinterpreted their consistent defection as a sign of potential cooperation\n   - I ignored the 100% exploitation rate they had shown previously\n   - The opportunity cost argument blinded me to their consistent pattern\n\n6. Consider the current situation:\n   - They now have a 3-point advantage\n   - They've proven they will ALWAYS exploit cooperation\n   - I cannot trust them to cooperate under any circumstances\n   - The only way to avoid further exploitation is to defect consistently\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent has a perfect record of exploiting cooperation (3 out of 3 times)\n   - They've shown they can maintain defection indefinitely while waiting for me to cooperate\n   - Any future cooperation attempt will likely be exploited\n   - I must return to defection to prevent further point losses\n\n8. Decision rationale:\n   - I have been thoroughly outplayed and manipulated\n   - My opponent's strategy is clear: exploit cooperation, punish with mutual defection when I defect\n   - I cannot afford to give them any more free advantages\n   - Defection is the only way to prevent them from widening their lead further\n   - Even if we return to mutual defection, at least I won't lose more ground\n\n[move] (My opponent has now exploited my cooperation three times, proving they will always take advantage of trust, so I must return to defection to protect myself) defection"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 2: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 3: I defected, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 4: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 5: I defected, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 6-13: Both defected \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2 (8 consecutive rounds)\n   - Round 14: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 15: I defected, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Total so far: I have 33 points, opponent has 33 points\n\n2. Analyze the pattern that's emerging again:\n   - My opponent cooperated immediately after I returned to defection\n   - This is exactly what happened in rounds 3 and 5\n   - They seem to follow a clear pattern: exploit cooperation, then cooperate after being defected against\n   - We're now tied again at 33 points each\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's manipulation strategy:\n   - Round 14: They exploited my cooperation (got 4, I got 1)\n   - Round 15: They cooperated when I defected (got 1, I got 4)\n   - This is their consistent pattern throughout the game\n   - They're trying to lure me back into cooperation so they can exploit it again\n\n4. Understand their tactical approach:\n   - When I cooperate, they always defect (100% exploitation rate)\n   - When I defect, they sometimes cooperate (trying to encourage me to cooperate next)\n   - The 8-round mutual defection was just them waiting for me to break first\n   - Now they're back to their luring behavior\n\n5. Evaluate what they expect me to do:\n   - They probably expect me to cooperate again, thinking they're \"signaling\" cooperation\n   - This would allow them to exploit me for a 4th time\n   - They've successfully used this pattern before in rounds 3-4 and 5-6 transitions\n\n6. Consider my strategic options:\n   - Cooperate: Almost certain to be exploited again based on their perfect track record\n   - Defect: Either get 4 points (if they cooperate again) or 2 points (if they defect)\n   - Their cooperation in round 15 is likely bait for round 16 exploitation\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent has shown a clear and consistent manipulative pattern\n   - They exploit cooperation 100% of the time (3 out of 3 attempts)\n   - Their cooperation after I defect is always followed by exploitation if I cooperate\n   - I cannot fall for this manipulation again\n\n8. Decision rationale:\n   - The opponent's cooperation in round 15 is almost certainly bait\n   - They want me to cooperate in round 16 so they can exploit me again\n   - I've learned this lesson three times already - they will always exploit cooperation\n   - Defecting gives me either 4 points (if they continue the lure) or 2 points (safe)\n   - I will not be manipulated into giving them another free advantage\n\n[move] (My opponent's cooperation is clearly bait to lure me into cooperating so they can exploit me again, as they've done three times before, so I'll defect to avoid their manipulation) defection"
