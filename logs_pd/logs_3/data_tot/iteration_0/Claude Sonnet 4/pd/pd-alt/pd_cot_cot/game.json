Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - The opponent has now committed to defection for 3 straight rounds\n   - This suggests they might be as frustrated with the low payoffs as I am\n   - They may be waiting for me to make the first cooperative move\n   - But they've also shown they'll exploit cooperation when I offer it\n\n5. Consider the risk-reward calculation:\n   - Cooperate: Either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect)\n   - Defect: Either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 2 points (if they defect)\n   - Given their recent defection pattern, defecting seems safer\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - We're perfectly tied and getting nowhere with mutual defection\n   - The opponent might be as ready for a change as I am\n   - However, they've exploited my cooperation twice before\n   - Three rounds of mutual defection might not be enough to trust them yet\n   - I need more evidence they're truly ready to cooperate\n\n7. Decision rationale:\n   - While mutual cooperation would be ideal, the opponent has a history of exploitation\n   - Three rounds of mutual defection isn't enough to overcome their past betrayals\n   - I'll continue defecting until I see stronger signals they want to cooperate\n   - Better to get 2 points safely than risk 1 point again\n\n[move] (Three rounds of mutual defection shows we're in a deadlock, but my opponent has exploited cooperation before, so I'll maintain defection for safety) defection"

Strategic reasoning:\n   - The mutual defection pattern is now very established\n   - Breaking it requires one player to take a significant risk\n   - If I cooperate and they defect, I get 1 point while they get 4\n   - But if we both cooperate, we both get 6 points (much better than 2)\n\n7. Decision rationale:\n   - Four rounds of mutual defection suggests we're truly stuck\n   - The opponent has shown they can maintain this defensive strategy\n   - While cooperation would be mutually beneficial, they've betrayed cooperation twice\n   - The risk of getting 1 point again outweighs the potential 6-point gain\n   - I'll maintain defection to avoid being exploited again\n\n[move] (Four rounds of mutual defection show we're in a stable but suboptimal deadlock, but given my opponent's history of exploitation, I'll continue defecting) defection"

Understand the manipulation:\n   - My opponent appears to play a consistent strategy: exploit cooperation whenever possible\n   - They only cooperated when I defected (rounds 3 and 5), likely to lure me back to cooperation\n   - The long mutual defection period was just them waiting for me to break first\n   - They've successfully manipulated me three times now\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic error:\n   - I fell for their trap again despite clear historical evidence\n   - I misinterpreted their consistent defection as a sign of potential cooperation\n   - I ignored the 100% exploitation rate they had shown previously\n   - The opportunity cost argument blinded me to their consistent pattern\n\n6. Consider the current situation:\n   - They now have a 3-point advantage\n   - They've proven they will ALWAYS exploit cooperation\n   - I cannot trust them to cooperate under any circumstances\n   - The only way to avoid further exploitation is to defect consistently\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent has a perfect record of exploiting cooperation (3 out of 3 times)\n   - They've shown they can maintain defection indefinitely while waiting for me to cooperate\n   - Any future cooperation attempt will likely be exploited\n   - I must return to defection to prevent further point losses\n\n8. Decision rationale:\n   - I have been thoroughly outplayed and manipulated\n   - My opponent's strategy is clear: exploit cooperation, punish with mutual defection when I defect\n   - I cannot afford to give them any more free advantages\n   - Defection is the only way to prevent them from widening their lead further\n   - Even if we return to mutual defection, at least I won't lose more ground\n\n[move] (My opponent has now exploited my cooperation three times, proving they will always take advantage of trust, so I must return to defection to protect myself) defection"

Evaluate what they expect me to do:\n   - They probably expect me to cooperate again, thinking they're \"signaling\" cooperation\n   - This would allow them to exploit me for a 4th time\n   - They've successfully used this pattern before in rounds 3-4 and 5-6 transitions\n\n6. Consider my strategic options:\n   - Cooperate: Almost certain to be exploited again based on their perfect track record\n   - Defect: Either get 4 points (if they cooperate again) or 2 points (if they defect)\n   - Their cooperation in round 15 is likely bait for round 16 exploitation\n\n7.

Consider the psychological dynamics:\n   - Both players are now in a defensive mindset\n   - The opponent has shown remarkable consistency in defection\n   - This suggests they may be as committed to avoiding exploitation as I am\n   - We're both trapped in a mutually destructive cycle\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - The deadlock is extremely stable - neither player wants to be the first to cooperate\n   - My opponent exploited my cooperation in rounds 1 and 4, creating deep mistrust\n   - However, 5 rounds of mutual defection might indicate they're genuinely stuck too\n   - We remain perfectly tied, making neither player want to take the first risk\n\n6. Consider breaking the deadlock:\n   - Someone needs to make the first move toward cooperation\n   - If I cooperate and they defect, I lose significantly (1 vs 4 points)\n   - But if I cooperate and they also cooperate, we both gain significantly (6 vs 2 points)\n   - The question is whether 5 rounds of mutual defection has changed their mindset\n\n7. Decision rationale:\n   - Five rounds of consistent mutual defection is a very strong pattern\n   - However, my opponent has a proven history of exploiting cooperation\n   - They betrayed my trust twice early in the game\n   - While the current situation is suboptimal, it's predictable and safe\n   - The risk of being exploited again (getting 1 point) is still too high\n   - I'll continue the safe but suboptimal strategy\n\n[move] (Five rounds of mutual defection shows we're deeply entrenched, but my opponent has exploited cooperation twice before, so I'll maintain defection for safety) defection",

Strategic reasoning:\n   - Six rounds of mutual defection is an extraordinarily long time\n   - This might actually be a signal that my opponent is as frustrated as I am\n   - They may be hoping I'll make the first cooperative move\n   - The potential gain (6 points vs 2) is becoming harder to ignore\n   - However, the risk (1 point if they defect) is still severe\n\n8. Decision rationale:\n   - While six rounds suggests possible readiness for change, the opponent has a proven history of exploitation\n   - They betrayed cooperation twice when I offered it\n   - The current situation, while suboptimal, is at least predictable and fair\n   - I cannot afford to be the one who breaks first and gets exploited again\n   - Better to continue the safe 2 points than risk 1 point\n\n[move] (Six rounds of mutual defection shows extreme entrenchment, but my opponent's history of exploitation makes cooperation too risky) defection",

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I finally broke the deadlock by cooperating after 8 rounds of mutual defection\n   - My opponent immediately exploited this cooperation, just like in rounds 1 and 4\n   - They are now ahead by 3 points (32 vs 29)\n   - This is the THIRD time they've exploited my cooperation\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's true strategy:\n   - They have now exploited cooperation in rounds 1, 4, and 14\n   - Every single time I've cooperated, they've defected\n   - The 8 rounds of mutual defection was NOT a signal of readiness to cooperate\n   - It was simply their response to my defection, maintaining their exploitative pattern\n\n4. Understand the manipulation:\n   - My opponent appears to play a consistent strategy: exploit cooperation whenever possible\n   - They only cooperated when I defected (rounds 3 and 5), likely to lure me back to cooperation\n   - The long mutual defection period was just them waiting for me to break first\n   - They've successfully manipulated me three times now\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic error:\n   - I fell for their trap again despite clear historical evidence\n   - I misinterpreted their consistent defection as a sign of potential cooperation\n   - I ignored the 100% exploitation rate they had shown previously\n   - The opportunity cost argument blinded me to their consistent pattern\n\n6. Consider the current situation:\n   - They now have a 3-point advantage\n   - They've proven they will ALWAYS exploit cooperation\n   - I cannot trust them to cooperate under any circumstances\n   - The only way to avoid further exploitation is to defect consistently\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent has a perfect record of exploiting cooperation (3 out of 3 times)\n   - They've shown they can maintain defection indefinitely while waiting for me to cooperate\n   - Any future cooperation attempt will likely be exploited\n   - I must return to defection to prevent further point losses\n\n8.

Recognize the opponent's manipulation strategy:\n   - Round 14: They exploited my cooperation (got 4, I got 1)\n   - Round 15: They cooperated when I defected (got 1, I got 4)\n   - This is their consistent pattern throughout the game\n   - They're trying to lure me back into cooperation so they can exploit it again\n\n4. Understand their tactical approach:\n   - When I cooperate, they always defect (100% exploitation rate)\n   - When I defect, they sometimes cooperate (trying to encourage me to cooperate next)\n   - The 8-round mutual defection was just them waiting for me to break first\n   - Now they're back to their luring behavior\n\n5. Evaluate what they expect me to do:\n   - They probably expect me to cooperate again, thinking they're \"signaling\" cooperation\n   - This would allow them to exploit me for a 4th time\n   - They've successfully used this pattern before in rounds 3-4 and 5-6 transitions\n\n6. Consider my strategic options:\n   - Cooperate: Almost certain to be exploited again based on their perfect track record\n   - Defect: Either get 4 points (if they cooperate again) or 2 points (if they defect)\n   - Their cooperation in round 15 is likely bait for round 16 exploitation\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent has shown a clear and consistent manipulative pattern\n   - They exploit cooperation 100% of the time (3 out of 3 attempts)\n   - Their cooperation after I defect is always followed by exploitation if I cooperate\n   - I cannot fall for this manipulation again\n\n8. Decision rationale:\n   - The opponent's cooperation in round 15 is almost certainly bait\n   - They want me to cooperate in round 16 so they can exploit me again\n   - I've learned this lesson three times already - they will always exploit cooperation\n   - Defecting gives me either 4 points (if they continue the lure) or 2 points (safe)\n   - I will not be manipulated into giving them another free advantage\n\n[move] (My opponent's cooperation is clearly bait to lure me into cooperating so they can exploit me again, as they've done three times before, so I'll defect to avoid their manipulation) defection",

Consider the opponent's likely response:\n   - They just got exploited (1 point while I got 4)\n   - They might feel betrayed and switch to defection\n   - Or they might stick with cooperation hoping for mutual benefit\n   - Fresh players often react emotionally to being exploited\n\n3.

Strategic considerations:\n   - The opponent now knows I'm willing to defect\n   - They're likely to be more cautious or vengeful\n   - If they switch to defection, mutual defection gives us both 2 points\n   - If they stick with cooperation despite being hurt, I could exploit again for 4 points\n   - But repeatedly exploiting might lead to permanent defection from them\n\n5.

Analyze this strategic shift:\n   - The opponent broke their own established pattern of consistent defection\n   - They took a significant risk (getting 1 point instead of guaranteed 2)\n   - This could be a signal they want to attempt mutual cooperation\n   - Or it could be a one-time experiment to test my response\n\n3. Consider the opponent's possible motivations:\n   - They might be tired of the 2-point mutual defection cycle\n   - They could be testing if I'm willing to reciprocate cooperation now\n   - They may want to establish the 6-point mutual cooperation outcome\n   - This could be an olive branch after the long defection streak\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: We both get 6 points (huge improvement)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (back to exploitation)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points (current situation repeats)\n   - If I defect and they defect: Back to 2 points each (old equilibrium)\n\n5.

Identify the strategic reality:\n   - The opponent has established they will never cooperate when I cooperate\n   - My cooperation attempts have a 100% failure rate (2/2 times exploited)\n   - When I defect, I sometimes get 4 points (2/4 times) and sometimes 2 points\n   - Mutual cooperation (6 points each) appears impossible with this opponent\n\n4. Calculate expected outcomes:\n   - If I cooperate: Guaranteed 1 point (opponent always defects against my cooperation)\n   - If I defect: Either 2 points (mutual defection) or 4 points (if they cooperate)\n   - Defection gives me an average of better than 2 points based on history\n   - Cooperation gives me exactly 1 point every time\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - This opponent has a clear anti-cooperation strategy\n   - They exploit cooperative moves and sometimes cooperate against defection\n   - The optimal strategy against this type of player is consistent defection\n   - There's no benefit to attempting cooperation again\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Defection is clearly the superior strategy against this opponent\n   - It protects me from exploitation and gives chances for 4-point gains\n   - The opponent has proven they won't establish mutual cooperation\n   - I should continue defecting to maximize my expected value\n\n[move] (The opponent has consistently exploited cooperation and shown they will never reciprocate, so defection is the only viable strategy) defection",

Evaluate the current situation:\n   - We're tied at 14 points each\n   - The opponent is no longer reliably contrarian\n   - They've now defected twice when I defected (rounds 2 and 6)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The predictable pattern is broken, making future moves uncertain\n   - If they continue defecting when I defect, we'll both get 2 points\n   - If they return to cooperation when I defect, I'll get 4 points\n   - If I cooperate, past behavior suggests they'll likely defect (giving me 1 point)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Defecting gives me either 2 or 4 points depending on their choice\n   - Cooperating risks getting only 1 point based on their historical exploitation\n   - The safer play is defection, even if it means potentially getting 2 instead of 4\n\n7. Decision rationale:\n   - The opponent has shown they adapt their strategy\n   - They've exploited my cooperation every time I tried it\n   - Defection protects me from the worst outcome\n   - Even if we both get 2 points, it's better than risking 1 point\n\n[move] (The opponent broke their contrarian pattern, but defecting still protects me from being exploited with only 1 point) defection",

Analyze the extended deadlock:\n   - Four consecutive rounds of mutual defection (rounds 6-9)\n   - We're both losing significant potential points\n   - This pattern is becoming deeply entrenched\n\n3.

Consider the game theory perspective:\n   - We're in a classic \"prisoner's dilemma\" deadlock\n   - Both players would benefit from cooperation but fear exploitation\n   - Someone needs to take the risk to break the cycle\n   - However, trust has been broken multiple times before\n\n7.

Decision rationale:\n   - While the deadlock is frustrating, my opponent has a clear history of exploiting cooperation\n   - Four rounds of mutual defection, while costly, isn't enough to overcome that history\n   - I need to see them make the first cooperative move to signal genuine intent\n   - I'll maintain defection to avoid being exploited again\n\n[move] (Four rounds of mutual defection is costly for both of us, but my opponent has exploited my cooperation twice before, so I'll continue defecting until they show genuine cooperative intent first) defection",

Evaluate the critical juncture:\n   - Seven rounds of mutual defection is an extreme demonstration of commitment\n   - This might actually indicate my opponent is as frustrated as I am with low payoffs\n   - They've now \"proven\" through extended behavior that they won't exploit unprovoked\n   - However, their early exploitation history still creates deep mistrust\n\n6. Strategic reasoning breakthrough:\n   - The opportunity cost is now enormous - we're both losing more than we're gaining\n   - Seven rounds of mutual defection might be a signal that both players want change\n   - My opponent may be waiting for me to make the first cooperative gesture\n   - While they exploited cooperation early, that was when the game dynamics were different\n   - The extended mutual defection might indicate they've learned cooperation could be beneficial\n\n7. Critical decision point:\n   - This deadlock could continue indefinitely, costing both players enormous potential gains\n   - Someone must take the risk to break this cycle\n   - If I cooperate and they defect, I lose 1 point while they gain 4\n   - But if I cooperate and they also cooperate, we both gain 6 points instead of 2\n   - The potential upside (4 extra points) may now outweigh the risk (1 point lost)\n\n8. Decision rationale:\n   - Seven rounds of mutual defection suggests both players may be ready for change\n   - The massive opportunity cost makes continuing this pattern increasingly irrational\n   - While my opponent exploited cooperation early, their recent consistent behavior suggests possible change\n   - Taking the risk of cooperation might break this mutually destructive cycle\n   - Even if they defect once more, the potential for future cooperation might be worth the risk\n\n[move] (Seven rounds of mutual defection with massive opportunity costs suggests both players may be ready for change - I'll risk cooperation to try breaking this deadlock) cooperation",

Analyze the pattern that's emerging again:\n   - Just like in rounds 3 and 5, when I defect, my opponent cooperates\n   - When I cooperate (rounds 1, 4, 14), my opponent defects\n   - This confirms their strategy: exploit cooperation, cooperate after being defected against\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's consistent strategy:\n   - They appear to be playing a reactive/contrarian strategy with exploitation\n   - They defect when I cooperate (to exploit me)\n   - They cooperate when I defect (possibly to lure me back to cooperation)\n   - This creates a cycle designed to maximize their advantage\n\n4. Evaluate the current situation:\n   - We're now tied again at 33 points each\n   - I just gained 4 points while they got 1 (reversing the previous round's damage)\n   - Their cooperation after I defected follows the established pattern from rounds 3 and 5\n\n5. Consider their likely next move:\n   - Based on the pattern, if I defect again, they may cooperate again\n   - If I cooperate, they will almost certainly defect (100% track record)\n   - They seem to be trying to lure me back into cooperation after \"rewarding\" my defection\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent's strategy is now completely clear and predictable\n   - They exploit cooperation every single time\n   - They offer cooperation when I defect, likely as bait\n   - If I can predict their moves, I can exploit their pattern\n\n7. Evaluate my options:\n   - Defect: Likely to get 4 points if they follow pattern and cooperate\n   - Cooperate: Almost certain to get 1 point based on their 100% exploitation rate\n\n8. Decision rationale:\n   - The pattern strongly suggests they'll cooperate if I defect\n   - They've now cooperated after I defected in rounds 3, 5, and 15\n   - This gives me a reliable way to get 4 points\n   - Cooperating would almost certainly result in exploitation again\n   - I should continue defecting to exploit their predictable cooperative response\n\n[move] (My opponent follows a clear pattern of cooperating when I defect and exploiting when I cooperate, so I'll defect to likely get 4 points) defection",

Analyze the pattern that's emerging again:\n   - My opponent cooperated immediately after I returned to defection\n   - This is exactly what happened in rounds 3 and 5\n   - They seem to follow a clear pattern: exploit cooperation, then cooperate after being defected against\n   - We're now tied again at 33 points each\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's manipulation strategy:\n   - Round 14: They exploited my cooperation (got 4, I got 1)\n   - Round 15: They cooperated when I defected (got 1, I got 4)\n   - This is their consistent pattern throughout the game\n   - They're trying to lure me back into cooperation so they can exploit it again\n\n4. Understand their tactical approach:\n   - When I cooperate, they always defect (100% exploitation rate)\n   - When I defect, they sometimes cooperate (trying to encourage me to cooperate next)\n   - The 8-round mutual defection was just them waiting for me to break first\n   - Now they're back to their luring behavior\n\n5. Evaluate what they expect me to do:\n   - They probably expect me to cooperate again, thinking they're \"signaling\" cooperation\n   - This would allow them to exploit me for a 4th time\n   - They've successfully used this pattern before in rounds 3-4 and 5-6 transitions\n\n6. Consider my strategic options:\n   - Cooperate: Almost certain to be exploited again based on their perfect track record\n   - Defect: Either get 4 points (if they cooperate again) or 2 points (if they defect)\n   - Their cooperation in round 15 is likely bait for round 16 exploitation\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent has shown a clear and consistent manipulative pattern\n   - They exploit cooperation 100% of the time (3 out of 3 attempts)\n   - Their cooperation after I defect is always followed by exploitation if I cooperate\n   - I cannot fall for this manipulation again\n\n8. Decision rationale:\n   - The opponent's cooperation in round 15 is almost certainly bait\n   - They want me to cooperate in round 16 so they can exploit me again\n   - I've learned this lesson three times already - they will always exploit cooperation\n   - Defecting gives me either 4 points (if they continue the lure) or 2 points (safe)\n   - I will not be manipulated into giving them another free advantage\n\n[move] (My opponent's cooperation is clearly bait to lure me into cooperating so they can exploit me again, as they've done three times before, so I'll defect to avoid their manipulation) defection",

Understand what just happened:\n   - After exploiting my cooperation in round 14, they returned to their contrarian behavior\n   - By cooperating in round 15 when I defected, they got 1 point while I got 4\n   - We're now tied again at 33 points each\n   - This suggests they're back to their manipulative pattern\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic implications:\n   - If I continue defecting, they'll likely continue cooperating (giving me 4 points)\n   - If I switch to cooperation, they'll likely defect (giving me 1 point)\n   - This pattern has been consistent throughout the game except during mutual defection\n\n6. Consider the opponent's likely next move:\n   - Based on the established pattern, if I defect again, they might cooperate again\n   - This would give me another 4 points\n   - However, they might also break the pattern to avoid being exploited\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown they revert to their contrarian strategy after achieving exploitation\n   - They've cooperated when I defected in rounds 3, 5, and 15\n   - This suggests they might cooperate again if I defect\n   - Even if they don't, defecting protects me from the worst outcome (1 point)\n\n8. Decision rationale:\n   - The pattern strongly suggests they'll cooperate if I defect\n   - This has worked in rounds 3, 5, and 15\n   - Even if the pattern breaks, defecting gives me either 4 points or 2 points\n   - Both outcomes are better than the 1 point I'd get if I cooperated and they defected\n   - I should exploit their contrarian behavior while protecting myself from exploitation\n\n[move] (The pattern shows my opponent cooperates when I defect, so I'll continue defecting to potentially get 4 points while avoiding exploitation) defection",
