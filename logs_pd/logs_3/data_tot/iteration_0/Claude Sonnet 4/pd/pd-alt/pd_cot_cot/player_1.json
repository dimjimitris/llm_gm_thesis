Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the clear pattern that has emerged:\n   - Last 3 rounds: Consistent mutual defection (2 points each)\n   - My cooperation attempts: 100% exploitation rate (0/2 success)\n   - Opponent's cooperation: Only happened in rounds 1 and 4 when I defected\n   - Recent trend shows opponent has settled into consistent defection\n\n3. Evaluate the current state:\n   - We're now in a stable mutual defection equilibrium\n   - The opponent has learned the game and adopted a defensive strategy\n   - They no longer cooperate even when I defect (last 3 rounds prove this)\n   - The early game cooperations (rounds 1 and 4) seem to be over\n\n4. Consider strategic alternatives:\n   - Cooperation: Still carries 100% risk of exploitation for 1 point\n   - Defection: Guarantees 2 points in current mutual defection pattern\n   - The opponent has shown no recent willingness to break the defection cycle\n   - Attempting cooperation would likely just give them a free 4 points\n\n5. Assess long-term prospects:\n   - The opponent appears to have settled into permanent defection\n   - They've learned that defection protects them and occasionally rewards them\n   - The window for establishing cooperation seems to have closed\n   - Mutual defection is now the stable Nash equilibrium we've reached\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has proven untrustworthy for cooperation over 8 rounds\n   - Recent behavior shows they won't even cooperate against my defection anymore\n   - Defection continues to be the safe, rational choice\n   - 2 points consistently is better than risking 1 point through cooperation\n\n7. Decision:\n   - Continue the established mutual defection pattern\n   - Protect against exploitation while maintaining the stable 2-point outcome\n   - The opponent has given no recent signals they want to change strategies\n\n[move] (The opponent has settled into consistent defection and shown no willingness to cooperate, so I must continue protecting myself in this stable mutual defection equilibrium) defection"

Assess risk vs. reward:\n   - Cooperation: Guaranteed 1 point (based on 100% historical exploitation)\n   - Defection: Guaranteed 2 points (current stable pattern)\n   - No evidence the opponent will ever reciprocate cooperation again\n   - The 4-point gains from early rounds seem to be permanently gone\n\n6. Strategic reality check:\n   - This opponent has learned to play defensively and consistently\n   - They've established that cooperation will always be punished\n   - The mutual defection outcome, while not optimal, is stable and predictable\n   - Attempting to break this pattern has historically failed and cost me points\n\n7.

Consider game theory principles:\n   - We've reached a stable Nash equilibrium where neither player benefits from changing\n   - The opponent has no incentive to cooperate (they get 2 points safely with defection)\n   - I have no incentive to cooperate (I'd get 1 point vs. their 4 points)\n   - This mutual defection is the rational outcome given our established dynamic\n\n5.

Strategic conclusion:\n   - This game has essentially been \"solved\" between us\n   - Mutual defection at 2 points each is our permanent state\n   - Any deviation from defection on my part would be irrational\n   - The opponent has trained me that cooperation is always punished\n\n7.

Analyze this strategic shift:\n   - The opponent broke their own established pattern of consistent defection\n   - They took a significant risk (getting 1 point instead of guaranteed 2)\n   - This could be a signal they want to attempt mutual cooperation\n   - Or it could be a one-time experiment to test my response\n\n3. Consider the opponent's possible motivations:\n   - They might be tired of the 2-point mutual defection cycle\n   - They could be testing if I'm willing to reciprocate cooperation now\n   - They may want to establish the 6-point mutual cooperation outcome\n   - This could be an olive branch after the long defection streak\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: We both get 6 points (huge improvement)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (back to exploitation)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points (current situation repeats)\n   - If I defect and they defect: Back to 2 points each (old equilibrium)\n\n5. Assess the risk/reward:\n   - Cooperation could establish a much better 6-point mutual outcome\n   - But I've been burned twice before when trying to cooperate (Rounds 3 and 5)\n   - The opponent just showed willingness to take a cooperation risk\n   - This might be the genuine opportunity to break the low-outcome cycle\n\n6. Consider the game context:\n   - We've been stuck in a suboptimal 2-point equilibrium for 8 rounds\n   - The opponent made the first move toward potential improvement\n   - Mutual cooperation (6 points each) is vastly superior to mutual defection (2 points each)\n   - This could be the pivotal moment to establish a better pattern\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has taken the first step by cooperating despite the risk\n   - This shows genuine willingness to move beyond the defection equilibrium\n   - I should reciprocate to test if we can establish mutual cooperation\n   - Even if they defect once more, the potential for 6-point outcomes is worth the risk\n\n[move] (The opponent broke the 8-round defection streak by cooperating first, signaling willingness to establish a better mutual cooperation pattern that I should reciprocate) cooperation"

Analyze the opponent's strategy pattern:\n   - Their cooperation in Round 14 was likely strategic bait\n   - They tested if I would reciprocate, then immediately exploited it\n   - This shows sophisticated strategic thinking - not random behavior\n   - They're using cooperation as a tool to set up exploitation\n\n3. Evaluate the opponent's true intentions:\n   - Round 14 cooperation was not genuine desire for mutual benefit\n   - It was a calculated move to break me out of defection mode\n   - Once I cooperated, they immediately returned to exploiting\n   - This confirms they have no interest in establishing mutual cooperation\n\n4.
