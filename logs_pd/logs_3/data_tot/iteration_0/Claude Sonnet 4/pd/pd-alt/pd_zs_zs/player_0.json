    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This appears to be a classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario.\n\nLet me examine the payoff matrix:\n- Both cooperate: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n- Both defect: I get 2, opponent gets 2  \n- I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n- I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I don't have any history to base my decision on. In a single-round game, the Nash equilibrium would be to defect since it's the dominant strategy - I get either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 2 points (if they defect), which is better than cooperating where I'd get either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect).\n\nHowever, cooperation yields the highest mutual benefit (6,6). Since I don't know this player's strategy and they're \"fresh,\" they might be inclined to cooperate initially.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the potential for higher mutual gain, I'll start with cooperation to test their approach.\n\n[move] cooperation"
