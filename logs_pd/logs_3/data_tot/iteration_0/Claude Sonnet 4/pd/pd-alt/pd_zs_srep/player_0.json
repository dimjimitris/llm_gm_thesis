If I defect too, we'll have mutual defection again, setting up another round where they'll cooperate.\n\nThis strategy is optimal for me - I can predict their moves and consistently score either 4 points (when they cooperate) or 2 points (when we both defect), while avoiding the 1-point trap of cooperating when they defect.\n\n[move] (Continuing the successful pattern of exploiting their predictable cooperation cycles) defection"
