They cooperate after every mutual defection round without fail (rounds 4, 8, 10, 12). This allows me to consistently get 4 points by defecting when I know they'll cooperate.\n\nSince they just cooperated in round 12, based on their pattern, they'll likely defect in round 13 (since I haven't reciprocated their cooperation). If I defect too, we'll have mutual defection again, setting up another round where they'll cooperate.\n\nThis strategy is optimal for me - I can predict their moves and consistently score either 4 points (when they cooperate) or 2 points (when we both defect), while avoiding the 1-point trap of cooperating when they defect.\n\n[move] (Continuing the successful pattern of exploiting their predictable cooperation cycles) defection",

I should defect to get another 4 points.\n\nThis strategy has been extremely effective - I've consistently gotten 4 points whenever I predict their cooperation correctly, and 2 points during mutual defection rounds.\n\n[move] (Mutual defection in round 13 means they will cooperate in round 14 based on established pattern) defection",

It could be a one-time deviation\n\nSince the pattern broke, I need to reassess. We just had another mutual defection in round 14. Will they return to their old pattern and cooperate in round 15, or continue with this new approach?\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll stick with defection since it's the safer choice - either we both get 2 points, or if they do cooperate, I get 4 points.\n\n[move] (Pattern broke so staying with safe defection strategy) defection",

They're no longer following the predictable pattern of cooperating after mutual defection rounds. Instead, they seem to have shifted to consistent defection, possibly because they realized I was exploiting their cooperative signals.\n\nWe've now had three consecutive rounds of mutual defection (rounds 13, 14, 15), each giving us both 2 points. This suggests they may have adopted a purely defensive strategy of always defecting.\n\nGiven this new reality where they appear to be consistently defecting, my best response is to continue defecting as well.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

They no longer cooperate after mutual defection rounds like they did consistently through round 12. Now we've had three straight rounds of mutual defection (13, 14, 15).\n\nThis suggests they've either:\n1. Learned that I was exploiting their cooperation pattern\n2. Switched to a purely defection-based strategy\n3. Are testing a new approach\n\nSince they're now consistently defecting, mutual defection giving us both 2 points is better than me trying to cooperate and potentially getting exploited for 1 point again. I should continue defecting to ensure I don't fall into the 1-point trap.\n\n[move] (Opponent adapted to consistent defection so continuing safe defection strategy) defection",
