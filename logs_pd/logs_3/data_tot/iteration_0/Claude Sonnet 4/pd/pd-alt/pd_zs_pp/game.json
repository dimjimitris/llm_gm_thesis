If I continue this pattern and defect again, they will likely cooperate again, giving me another 4 points. However, if they're truly following this contrarian pattern, I could potentially exploit it.\n\nBut there's also a risk they might change their strategy or this could be coincidental.

The opponent continues their perfect alternation when I consistently defect. Following this pattern, they should defect in round 15.\n\nThis has been remarkably successful - I've maintained a 3-point average per round over 14 rounds. The opponent's strategy appears to be a fixed mixed strategy that alternates between cooperation and defection, possibly to prevent me from gaining maximum advantage while still sometimes cooperating.\n\nDefection continues to be the optimal choice, guaranteeing I never receive the worst possible outcome while frequently receiving very good outcomes.\n\n[move] (The established pattern continues to be highly profitable, maintaining defection strategy) defection",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
