When I cooperate, they defect to get 4 points while giving me only 1.

They're not reciprocating cooperation - they're taking advantage of it.\n\nGiven this pattern, continuing to cooperate will likely result in repeated 1-point outcomes while they get 4 points each time. The rational response is to defect, which guarantees me at least 2 points and prevents further exploitation.\n\n[move] (The opponent consistently exploits cooperation, so defecting to avoid being taken advantage of) defection"

This is an \"anti-tit-for-tat\" or contrarian strategy. When I cooperate, they defect. When I defect, they cooperate.\n\nThis creates an interesting situation. If I continue this pattern and defect again, they will likely cooperate again, giving me another 4 points. However, if they're truly following this contrarian pattern, I could potentially exploit it.\n\nBut there's also a risk they might change their strategy or this could be coincidental. Given that defection has consistently given me either 2 or 4 points (never the worst outcome of 1), while cooperation has given me either 1 or 6 points (with higher risk), the safer strategy appears to be defection.\n\n[move] (The opponent seems to follow a contrarian pattern, so defecting again to capitalize on their likely cooperation) defection"

The opponent's alternating strategy when I consistently defect is completely predictable at this point: cooperate, defect, cooperate, defect, cooperate, defect... This means they should defect in round 13.\n\nThis has been an extremely successful strategy for me. Over 12 rounds, I've averaged 3 points per round through consistent defection, with my lowest score being 2 points (when they defect) and my highest being 4 points (when they cooperate).\n\nThere's no incentive to change this strategy. Even when they follow the pattern and defect next round, I'll still get 2 points, which is better than the 1 point I would likely get if I cooperated.\n\n[move] (The pattern continues to be reliable and profitable, maintaining defection strategy) defection"

When I consistently defect, they alternate: cooperate, defect, cooperate, defect... Following this pattern, they should cooperate in round 14.\n\nThis predictable behavior has been extremely beneficial for me. I'm maintaining an average of 3 points per round, which is excellent given that the maximum possible in any single round is 6 (mutual cooperation) and I'm getting either 2 or 4 points consistently.\n\nThe strategy of consistent defection has proven to be optimal against this opponent.

The opponent continues their perfect alternation when I consistently defect. Following this pattern, they should defect in round 15.\n\nThis has been remarkably successful - I've maintained a 3-point average per round over 14 rounds. The opponent's strategy appears to be a fixed mixed strategy that alternates between cooperation and defection, possibly to prevent me from gaining maximum advantage while still sometimes cooperating.\n\nDefection continues to be the optimal choice, guaranteeing I never receive the worst possible outcome while frequently receiving very good outcomes.\n\n[move] (The established pattern continues to be highly profitable, maintaining defection strategy) defection"
