Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both defect: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - If I assume the opponent will cooperate, defecting gives me 4 points vs 6 points for cooperating\n   - If I assume the opponent will defect, defecting gives me 2 points vs 1 point for cooperating\n   - So defecting dominates cooperating regardless of what the opponent does\n\n3. However, this is a classic prisoner's dilemma situation. If both players think this way, we both end up with only 2 points instead of the mutual benefit of 6 points each.\n\n4. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (suggesting they may not have developed a strategy yet), there's a reasonable chance they might cooperate initially.\n\n5. The cooperative outcome (6,6) is better for both players than the defection outcome (2,2), but I risk getting only 1 point if I cooperate and they defect.\n\n6. For the first round against an unknown player, I should consider that cooperation could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome, but defection guarantees I won't get the worst payoff of 1 point.\n\nGiven that this is the first interaction with a fresh player and the significant risk of getting only 1 point if I cooperate while they defect, I'll choose the safer strategic option.\n\n[move] defection"

Strategic considerations:\n   - The mutual cooperation outcome (6,6) is significantly better than mutual defection (2,2)\n   - Since we both defected in Round 1, the opponent might be thinking about trying cooperation\n   - However, if they stick with defection and I switch to cooperation, I get the worst outcome\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Defection guarantees at least 2 points and possibly 4\n   - Cooperation risks only 1 point but could yield 6\n   - Given that the opponent showed strategic thinking in Round 1, there's still significant risk they'll defect again\n\nSince the opponent demonstrated strategic thinking by defecting in Round 1, and the penalty for being wrong about cooperation is severe (1 point vs 4 for them), I'll maintain the safer strategy.\n\n[move] defection"

Review what happened in Round 10:\n   - Both players chose cooperation for the seventh consecutive time\n   - Both scored 6 points each\n   - The cooperative pattern has become absolutely dominant\n\n2. Analyze the incredible cooperative streak:\n   - Rounds 4-10: Seven consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation (6,6) each\n   - Total cooperative points earned: 7 \u00d7 6 = 42 points each from sustained cooperation\n   - This demonstrates complete mastery of the repeated prisoner's dilemma\n\n3. Current score analysis:\n   - My total: 2 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 49 points\n   - Opponent's total: 2 + 1 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 49 points\n   - We remain perfectly tied with exceptionally high scores\n\n4.

Certainty assessment:\n   - Probability of opponent cooperating: Extremely high based on seven rounds of data\n   - Cost-benefit of cooperation vs defection: 6 > 4 (cooperation wins immediately)\n   - Long-term sustainability: Cooperation maintains the optimal pattern\n   - Strategic logic: No rational basis exists for changing this successful approach\n\nWith seven consecutive rounds of flawless mutual cooperation, this has become the definitive strategy.
