You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

The pattern seems to have shifted slightly but they're still periodically attempting cooperation despite being consistently exploited.\n\nThey've now been exploited every single time they've cooperated (rounds 1, 4, 7, 11), yet they keep trying. This suggests they might be following some kind of forgiving or optimistic strategy, or testing to see if mutual cooperation is possible.\n\nGiven that they just got exploited again in round 11, they'll likely defect in round 12 based on the historical pattern of defecting after being exploited.\n\nLooking at their behavior after being exploited:\n- After round 1: defected in rounds 2-3\n- After round 4: defected in rounds 5-6  \n- After round 7: defected in rounds 8-10\n- After round 11: likely to defect in round 12\n\n[move] (Opponent consistently defects after being exploited, expecting defection in response to round 11) defection"

Eventually trying cooperation again\n\nThey're currently in their post-exploitation defection phase after round 11.
