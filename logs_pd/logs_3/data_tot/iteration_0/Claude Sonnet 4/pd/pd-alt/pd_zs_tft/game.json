The pattern seems to have shifted slightly but they're still periodically attempting cooperation despite being consistently exploited.\n\nThey've now been exploited every single time they've cooperated (rounds 1, 4, 7, 11), yet they keep trying.

The intervals were 3, 3, then 4 rounds. If they're still following some version of their periodic cooperation strategy, they might try again soon, though the interval seems to be expanding slightly.\n\nGiven their persistent pattern of:\n1. Attempting cooperation periodically\n2. Getting exploited every time\n3. Defecting for several rounds afterward\n4. Eventually trying cooperation again\n\nThey're currently in their post-exploitation defection phase after round 11. Based on previous patterns, they typically defect for 2-3 rounds after being exploited before attempting cooperation again.\n\nSince we just had mutual defection in round 12, they'll likely continue defecting in round 13.\n\n[move] (Opponent in post-exploitation defection phase, expecting continued defection) defection",

They've now defected for 2 rounds since round 11, so round 14 could potentially be when they try cooperation again, following their historical pattern.\n\nHowever, the intervals between cooperation attempts have been increasing (3, 3, 4 rounds), and they might be becoming more cautious given the consistent exploitation.\n\nThere's a reasonable chance they might attempt cooperation in round 14 based on their established pattern of periodic cooperation attempts.\n\n[move] (Opponent may attempt cooperation again after 2-round defection phase, testing for mutual cooperation) cooperation",

The game has become increasingly dominated by defection.\n\nMy opponent seems to have learned from the consistent exploitation and may be shifting toward a more permanently defensive strategy. They've now exploited my cooperation attempts in rounds 3, 6, 10, and 14.\n\nGiven that they just exploited my cooperation in round 14 and are in their longest defection streak, they're very likely to continue defecting in round 15.

This suggests they're either:\n1. Following a rigid strategy regardless of outcomes\n2. Persistently hoping for mutual cooperation\n3. Testing if I'll ever reciprocate\n\nGiven their pattern of defecting after being exploited, they'll very likely defect in round 16.
