Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Recognize the opponent's strategy:\n   - They appear to be playing a strategy that always defects when I cooperate\n   - They occasionally cooperate when I defect (rounds 1 and 4) to entice me to cooperate again\n   - This is a sophisticated exploitation strategy designed to maximize their advantage\n   - They're essentially \"baiting\" me into cooperation so they can exploit it\n\n4. Understand my strategic error:\n   - I keep falling for the same pattern\n   - I've given the opponent 3 easy wins by cooperating\n   - My attempts to establish mutual cooperation have been consistently punished\n   - I need to stop being predictable and exploitable\n\n5. Evaluate my options going forward:\n   - If I cooperate again: Almost certainly will get 1 point (based on 100% historical pattern)\n   - If I defect: Will get either 2 points (if they defect) or 4 points (if they cooperate)\n   - The opponent has shown they will cooperate occasionally when I defect, but never when I cooperate\n\n6. Decision:\n   The opponent has a clear pattern of exploiting every cooperation attempt. I must stop being exploitable and defect to protect myself and potentially gain an advantage.\n\n[move] (The opponent has exploited every single cooperation attempt with 100% consistency, so I must protect myself from further exploitation) defection"

Recognize the strategic situation:\n   - The opponent is ahead by 3 points (22 vs 19)\n   - They have successfully trained me to be cautious about cooperating\n   - They've established a pattern where mutual defection is the \"safe\" choice\n   - But they might cooperate occasionally to tempt me into another exploitable cooperation\n\n4. Consider the opponent's likely next move:\n   - After mutual defection, they sometimes cooperate (like in rounds 1 and 4)\n   - This could be another \"bait\" attempt to get me to cooperate next round\n   - Or they might continue defecting to maintain their lead safely\n   - The pattern suggests they might throw in a cooperation to keep me guessing\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points, they get 1 (closes the gap)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points, they get 2 (maintains gap)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point, they get 4 (widens gap to 6)\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 6 points, they get 6 (closes gap)\n\n6.

Analyze the extended mutual defection pattern:\n   - We've now had 4 consecutive rounds of mutual defection (rounds 8-11)\n   - The opponent still maintains a 3-point lead (26 vs 23)\n   - This is the longest streak of mutual defection in the game\n   - Both players are getting consistent but low scores (2 points each)\n\n3. Recognize the strategic deadlock:\n   - The opponent appears to have shifted to a purely defensive strategy\n   - They're no longer using cooperation as bait like they did earlier\n   - They seem content to maintain their lead through safe mutual defection\n   - This pattern could continue indefinitely if neither player changes\n\n4. Consider the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They're ahead and playing it safe\n   - They may have concluded that baiting me is no longer worth the risk\n   - They might expect me to eventually try cooperation out of frustration\n   - Or they're waiting for me to make the first move to break the pattern\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Continuing defection: Maintains current 3-point deficit indefinitely\n   - Trying cooperation: High risk (1 point) but potential for breaking deadlock\n   - The opponent has exploited 100% of my cooperation attempts so far\n   - But the extended mutual defection might make them more likely to cooperate now\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - I'm behind and mutual defection won't help me catch up\n   - The opponent hasn't cooperated since round 4 (7 rounds ago)\n   - They might be overconfident in their defensive strategy\n   - Taking a calculated risk might be necessary to change the game dynamic\n\n7. Decision:\n   After 4 rounds of mutual defection, the opponent might not expect cooperation from me. This could be the right moment to attempt breaking the deadlock, despite the historical risk.\n\n[move] (After four consecutive mutual defections, the opponent might not expect cooperation, so this could be the moment to break the deadlock) cooperation"
