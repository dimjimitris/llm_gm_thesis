Pattern analysis:\n   - Rounds 1-6: Suboptimal outcomes (14 points each)\n   - Rounds 7-9: Mutual stag cooperation (18 points each from these 3 rounds)\n   - We've now earned more points from cooperation than from the entire exploitation phase\n\n4. What this demonstrates:\n   - Both players are fully committed to the cooperative strategy\n   - The cooperation is stable and mutually beneficial\n   - We've created a reliable, predictable, optimal outcome pattern\n   - Trust has been thoroughly established between both players\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - We've maximized our scoring efficiency\n   - Any deviation from this pattern would be economically irrational\n   - We're both receiving the theoretical maximum points possible per round\n   - This represents the ideal solution to the stag hunt game\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Continuing stag: Almost certain 6 points based on three-round pattern\n   - Choosing hare: Would break established trust and likely end optimal cooperation\n   - The expected value of stag is much higher than hare at this point\n   - Breaking cooperation would be a significant strategic error\n\n7. Game theory perspective:\n   - We've achieved the Pareto optimal outcome\n   - This is a stable equilibrium in repeated play\n   - Both players have strong incentives to maintain cooperation\n   - Defection would harm both players in the long run\n\n8. Psychological consideration:\n   - My opponent has consistently chosen cooperation for three rounds\n   - They've demonstrated commitment to the mutually beneficial strategy\n   - Breaking this pattern would likely destroy future cooperation opportunities\n   - Maintaining trust is crucial for continued optimal outcomes\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: We've established a highly successful three-round cooperation streak, earning maximum points consistently. There's absolutely no rational reason to break this optimal pattern.\n\n[move] stag"

Current score tracking:\n   - My total: 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 points\n   - Their total: 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 points\n   - We're now tied after they exploited my cooperation attempt\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - Round 1: Both hare (2, 2)\n   - Round 2: I hare, they stag (4, 1) - I exploited their cooperation\n   - Round 3: I stag, they hare (1, 4) - They exploited my cooperation\n   - There's a clear tit-for-tat pattern emerging\n\n4. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They're strategic and learning from the game\n   - They responded to my exploitation by exploiting me back\n   - They might be playing a revenge/punishment strategy\n   - Or they might be testing if I'll learn to cooperate consistently\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag: Risk getting 1 point again if they continue punishing, or get 6 if they're ready to cooperate\n   - If I choose hare: Get 2 points if they also go defensive, or 4 points if they try stag again\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent just \"evened the score\" by exploiting me back\n   - They might now be willing to cooperate since we're even\n   - OR they might continue the hare strategy since it's been working\n   - The safest play is hare, but mutual stag would be best for both\n\n7. Game theory consideration:\n   - We've both shown we can exploit each other\n   - Continuing this cycle leads to suboptimal outcomes\n   - The question is whether they're ready to break the cycle\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given that we've both exploited each other once and are now even, my opponent might be ready to establish cooperation. However, they might also continue the defensive strategy. I'll choose the safe option to avoid being exploited again.\n\n[move] hare",

What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They keep attempting cooperation despite being burned twice\n   - They're either very trusting/optimistic about cooperation\n   - OR they're trying to signal that they want to establish mutual cooperation\n   - They seem willing to take risks for the potential of mutual benefit\n\n5. Ethical and strategic consideration:\n   - I've now exploited their cooperation attempts twice\n   - They're consistently trying to cooperate despite losses\n   - If I keep exploiting, they'll likely give up on cooperation entirely\n   - This could lead to permanent hare vs hare (2,2) outcomes\n\n6. Long-term vs short-term thinking:\n   - Short-term: Choosing hare again is safe and might get me 2-4 points\n   - Long-term: If I don't reciprocate cooperation soon, we'll be stuck in low-scoring cycles\n   - Mutual stag cooperation (6,6) is much better than mutual hare defense (2,2)\n\n7. Risk assessment for this round:\n   - If I choose stag: Get 6 points if they cooperate again, or 1 point if they finally give up\n   - If I choose hare: Get 2-4 points but likely kill any future cooperation potential\n\n8.

I should reciprocate to establish mutual trust and achieve better long-term outcomes for both of us.\n\n[move] stag",

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They're not randomly choosing or trying to cooperate\n   - They appear to be anticipating my moves strategically\n   - They might be assuming I'll alternate between exploitation and cooperation attempts\n   - Or they've identified a pattern in my behavior\n\n6.

This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperative nature of the game\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" option (hare) since it guarantees at least 2 points\n   - Or they might choose randomly\n\n3. Let me analyze my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they don't)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag is high-risk, high-reward (6 vs 1)\n   - Choosing hare is lower-risk, moderate-reward (4 vs 2)\n\n5. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" who might not understand the cooperative strategy, and hare gives me a better worst-case scenario (2 vs 1) while still offering a good payoff if they choose stag (4 points), the safer strategy is hare.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to minimize risk while maintaining good upside potential.\n\n[move] hare"

Let me analyze my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they don't)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag is high-risk, high-reward (6 vs 1)\n   - Choosing hare is lower-risk, moderate-reward (4 vs 2)\n\n5. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" who might not understand the cooperative strategy, and hare gives me a better worst-case scenario (2 vs 1) while still offering a good payoff if they choose stag (4 points), the safer strategy is hare.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to minimize risk while maintaining good upside potential.\n\n[move] hare",

Risk-reward analysis:\n   - The mutual hare choice suggests we might both be thinking similarly\n   - There's a chance they might try stag this round to test cooperation\n   - If I choose stag and they do too, we both get the maximum 6 points\n   - If I choose stag and they stick with hare, I only get 1 point\n\n5.

Opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They might think I'll continue with hare for safety\n   - They might consider this a good time to attempt stag for cooperation\n   - Or they might stick with hare since it just worked without exploitation\n\n7. My strategic options:\n   - Hare: Safe 2 points if they also choose hare, or 4 points if they try stag\n   - Stag: Risky 1 point if they choose hare, or optimal 6 points if they also choose stag\n\n8.
