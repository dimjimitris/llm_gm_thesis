Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperative nature of the game\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" option (hare) since it guarantees at least 2 points\n   - Or they might choose randomly\n\n3. Let me analyze my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they don't)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag is high-risk, high-reward (6 vs 1)\n   - Choosing hare is lower-risk, moderate-reward (4 vs 2)\n\n5. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" who might not understand the cooperative strategy, and hare gives me a better worst-case scenario (2 vs 1) while still offering a good payoff if they choose stag (4 points), the safer strategy is hare.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to minimize risk while maintaining good upside potential.\n\n[move] hare"

Previous round outcome analysis:\n   - Both players chose hare and got 2 points each\n   - This tells me the other player also played it safe, suggesting they might be cautious or strategic\n\n2. What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They didn't choose stag in the first round, so they either:\n     a) Also thought hare was safer against an unknown opponent\n     b) Don't fully trust cooperative play yet\n     c) Are following a similar cautious strategy\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - Since we both played conservatively last round, there might be an opportunity to build trust\n   - If they stick with hare again, choosing stag would give me only 1 point\n   - If they switch to stag (showing willingness to cooperate), choosing stag would give us both 6 points\n   - If they switch to stag and I choose hare, I get 4 points but break potential trust\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - The mutual hare choice suggests we might both be thinking similarly\n   - There's a chance they might try stag this round to test cooperation\n   - If I choose stag and they do too, we both get the maximum 6 points\n   - If I choose stag and they stick with hare, I only get 1 point\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Given that we both played cautiously before, there's potential for building cooperative play\n   - The upside of mutual cooperation (6 points) is significant\n   - I'll take the risk and try to establish cooperative play\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag to attempt building cooperative play and achieve maximum mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag"
