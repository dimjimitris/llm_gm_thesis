Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player likely hasn't developed a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - They may not immediately recognize the cooperative potential of both choosing stag\n\n3.

Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag is high-risk, high-reward: potential for 6 points but risk of only 1 point\n   - Choosing hare is safer: guaranteed at least 2 points, with potential for 4 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against a fresh player who may not coordinate, hare seems safer\n   - Hare gives me a good outcome regardless of their choice (2 or 4 points)\n   - Stag could leave me with only 1 point if they don't cooperate\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given that I'm playing against a fresh player who likely won't coordinate for mutual benefit, I should choose the safer option that guarantees a reasonable outcome.\n\n[move] hare"

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They evolved their strategy from safe (hare in round 1) to cooperative (stag in round 2)\n   - They took a risk hoping I would also choose stag for mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - They got punished with only 1 point for this attempt at cooperation\n\n3.

Game theory consideration:\n   - We've solved the cooperation problem that plagued the first 6 rounds\n   - Mutual stag is a stable strategy when both players commit to it\n   - Any deviation would likely end this beneficial arrangement\n   - The rational choice is to maintain the cooperation\n\n8. Long-term perspective:\n   - We're now in the ideal state for this game\n   - Each round gives us both maximum points\n   - This is sustainable as long as both players maintain trust\n   - Breaking cooperation would be irrational given the current success\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: We've established successful mutual cooperation for two rounds straight, earning maximum points each time. I should absolutely continue this cooperation to maintain our optimal scoring pattern.\n\n[move] stag"
