    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game.

This is a very positive signal. Both players got the optimal 6 points, which is the best possible outcome.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** This is crucial information. The \"fresh player\" demonstrated they understand the value of mutual cooperation or at least were willing to take the risk. This suggests:\n1. They might continue cooperating if they see the pattern\n2. They're not necessarily trying to exploit us\n3. They may have recognized the mutual benefit of (stag, stag)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we successfully established cooperation in round 1. The question now is whether to continue with stag to reinforce this positive pattern, or whether the opponent might try to exploit our apparent willingness to cooperate.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** In iterated games like this, maintaining cooperation when it's been established is generally the optimal strategy. Since we both chose stag and both benefited maximally, there's a strong incentive for both players to continue this pattern.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I strongly recommend choosing stag again. Here's the reasoning:\n1. We've established a cooperative precedent\n2. The opponent showed they're willing to cooperate\n3. Breaking cooperation now would be risky - if they stick with stag and we switch to hare, we'd get 4 points but potentially destroy the cooperative relationship\n4.

This strongly indicates we've established a stable cooperative equilibrium. The pattern is clear - both players recognize the mutual benefit of choosing stag.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** This is textbook cooperative behavior. The opponent has now demonstrated twice that they:\n1. Understand the value of mutual cooperation\n2. Are committed to the high-reward strategy\n3. Are not trying to exploit our cooperative stance\n\nWith two successful rounds, the risk of them suddenly switching to hare is relatively low, especially since it would break a profitable pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We're clearly in a successful groove here. Both rounds resulted in the optimal 6-6 outcome. The opponent seems reliable and cooperative. Is there any reason to deviate from this winning strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** In game theory, when you've established a successful cooperative pattern, the rational choice is to maintain it unless there are signals that the other player might defect. We have no such signals - quite the opposite. Breaking cooperation now would be irrational and potentially costly.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I recommend stag again. The benefits are:\n1. Guaranteed maximum points if they continue cooperating (which is likely)\n2. Reinforces the positive relationship\n3. Maintains the stable equilibrium we've achieved\n\nThe only risk is if they suddenly switch to exploit us, but their behavior suggests they value the mutual benefit.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Agreed.

The probability that this opponent will suddenly defect after establishing such a strong cooperative pattern is extremely low.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** This is as close to a guaranteed win-win scenario as we can get in this game. The opponent has demonstrated three times that they:\n1. Fully understand the cooperative strategy\n2. Are committed to mutual benefit over individual exploitation\n3. Value the stable 6-point outcome\n\nAny rational player would continue this pattern.

The cooperative pattern is now deeply entrenched.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** At this point, we have overwhelming evidence that this opponent is a committed cooperator. Four identical outcomes of (stag, stag) represent a statistically significant pattern. The opponent has had multiple opportunities to exploit us but has consistently chosen mutual benefit instead. This level of consistency is remarkable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We're in an ideal situation. Perfect cooperation for four straight rounds with maximum points every time. The opponent has proven to be completely reliable and strategically aligned with mutual success. Is there any conceivable reason to change strategy now?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** None whatsoever.
