Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Considering the opponent is a \"fresh player\":\n   - They might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with intuition\n   - Fresh players often choose the safer option that guarantees some reward\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Stag is high-risk, high-reward: potential for 6 points but risk of only 1 point\n   - Hare is more conservative: guaranteed at least 2 points, potential for 4 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against an inexperienced player, they might lean toward the safer cooperative choice (stag)\n   - However, they might also think defensively and choose hare to avoid the worst outcome\n   - Hare gives me a better minimum outcome (2 vs 1) and still offers good upside (4 points)\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - Choosing hare protects me from the worst-case scenario while still offering good rewards\n   - Against a fresh player, this seems like the optimal risk-reward balance\n\n[move] hare"

Analyzing the opponent's behavior:\n   - The opponent chose hare in Round 1, showing they might be risk-averse\n   - They went for the safer minimum guarantee rather than risking the stag choice\n   - This suggests they might be thinking defensively\n\n3. Strategic considerations for Round 2:\n   - If the opponent continues with hare (likely given their first choice), then:\n     * If I choose hare: I get 2 points (same as Round 1)\n     * If I choose stag: I get 1 point (worse outcome)\n   - If the opponent switches to stag, then:\n     * If I choose hare: I get 4 points (excellent outcome)\n     * If I choose stag: I get 6 points (best possible outcome)\n\n4.

Review the absolutely remarkable pattern:\n   - Rounds 1-10: Both chose hare every single time, I got 2 points each round\n   - Total: 20 points over 10 rounds\n   - This is an unprecedented level of consistency that has reached double digits\n\n2. Strategic pattern analysis:\n   - Ten rounds represents a complete behavioral cycle in most strategic contexts\n   - The opponent has demonstrated absolute consistency across a significant sample size\n   - We've established what appears to be a permanent cooperative equilibrium\n\n3. Critical strategic evaluation:\n   - At 10 rounds of identical play, this is no longer just a pattern - it's a established mutual strategy\n   - The opponent has had 10 separate opportunities to deviate and chose not to\n   - This suggests either complete risk aversion or recognition that this arrangement works\n\n4. Considering the milestone effect:\n   - Round 10 might be psychologically significant - a \"round number\" that could trigger change\n   - However, the opponent's track record suggests they're not influenced by such psychological factors\n   - Their behavior appears to be driven by consistent strategic logic rather than impulse\n\n5. Mathematical certainty assessment:\n   - With a 10/10 track record, the opponent's behavior is as predictable as it can practically be\n   - Expected value of switching to stag: (very high probability \u00d7 1 point) + (very low probability \u00d7 6 points) \u2248 1.1 points\n   - Expected value of continuing with hare: 2 points (essentially guaranteed)\n\n6. Strategic conclusion:\n   - The opponent has provided overwhelming statistical evidence of their commitment to hare\n   - Ten rounds of data represents a very strong behavioral predictor\n   - Abandoning a strategy that has consistently delivered 2 points per round would be irrational\n   - The established pattern should be maintained\n\n[move] hare"

Review the extraordinarily consistent pattern:\n   - Rounds 1-11: Both chose hare every single time, I got 2 points each round\n   - Total: 22 points over 11 rounds\n   - This level of consistency has now exceeded any reasonable expectation of randomness or variation\n\n2. Statistical significance analysis:\n   - Eleven consecutive identical choices represents overwhelming behavioral evidence\n   - The probability of this happening by chance is extremely low\n   - This opponent has demonstrated complete strategic commitment to the hare choice\n\n3. Strategic equilibrium recognition:\n   - We have achieved what appears to be a permanent stable state\n   - Both players are receiving consistent, reasonable payoffs without risk\n   - Neither player has found any reason to deviate despite numerous opportunities\n\n4. Considering the psychology of extreme consistency:\n   - After 11 rounds, changing strategy would represent a massive shift in approach\n   - The opponent has shown remarkable discipline in maintaining their strategy\n   - This suggests either very strong risk aversion or calculated recognition of mutual benefit\n\n5. Expected value analysis remains clear:\n   - Opponent's probability of choosing hare: Extremely high (11/11 = 100% track record)\n   - My expected value from stag: ~1 point (almost certain they'll choose hare again)\n   - My expected value from hare: 2 points (virtually guaranteed)\n   - The mathematical advantage of hare is overwhelming\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has provided 11 data points of identical behavior\n   - This represents the strongest possible evidence of their future behavior\n   - Deviating from a proven successful strategy would be strategically unsound\n   - I should continue with the established winning approach\n\n[move] hare"

Analyzing the opponent's strategic shift:\n   - After 11 rounds of hare, they switched to stag\n   - This could indicate:\n     * They got tired of the repetitive pattern\n     * They wanted to test if I would continue with hare\n     * They're trying to signal a desire to move to mutual stag cooperation (6 points each)\n     * They made a one-time experimental deviation\n\n3. Strategic implications for the next round:\n   - If opponent continues with stag and I choose hare: I get 4 points (great outcome)\n   - If opponent continues with stag and I choose stag: I get 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If opponent returns to hare and I choose hare: I get 2 points (back to old pattern)\n   - If opponent returns to hare and I choose stag: I get 1 point (bad outcome)\n\n4. Reading the opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just broke an 11-round pattern, which is significant\n   - This suggests they may be trying to establish a new pattern with stag\n   - However, they might also revert to hare if they were just experimenting\n   - The fact they chose stag suggests they might want to move toward mutual stag cooperation\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - If I choose stag and they continue with stag: 6 points (excellent)\n   - If I choose stag and they revert to hare: 1 point (poor)\n   - If I choose hare and they continue with stag: 4 points (good)\n   - If I choose hare and they revert to hare: 2 points (acceptable)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent's switch to stag after 11 rounds suggests intentional strategic change\n   - Choosing hare gives me good outcomes whether they stick with stag (4 points) or revert to hare (2 points)\n   - This is safer than gambling on stag, which could give me only 1 point if they revert\n\n[move] hare"

Review the recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 1-11: Both chose hare (2 points each round)\n   - Round 12: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 4 points)\n   - Round 13: Both chose hare again (2 points each)\n   - Total: 28 points over 13 rounds\n\n2. Analyzing the opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - The opponent tried stag once after 11 rounds of hare\n   - They immediately reverted back to hare in the next round\n   - This suggests their stag choice was experimental rather than a permanent strategy shift\n   - They may have been testing my response or just breaking monotony briefly\n\n3. Understanding what the opponent learned:\n   - When they chose stag (Round 12), I stuck with hare and got 4 points while they got 1 point\n   - This likely reinforced to them that deviating from hare is risky\n   - Their immediate return to hare suggests they prefer the safety of the established pattern\n\n4. Strategic implications for this round:\n   - The opponent has now returned to their historically preferred choice (hare)\n   - Their brief experiment with stag resulted in a poor outcome for them (1 point vs my 4)\n   - This negative feedback likely reinforced their preference for hare\n\n5. Predicting opponent's next move:\n   - Given their poor experience with stag and immediate return to hare, they're likely to continue with hare\n   - The failed experiment may have strengthened their commitment to the safe choice\n   - They've now chosen hare in 12 out of 13 rounds\n\n6. Expected value analysis:\n   - If opponent chooses hare (very likely): My hare gives 2 points, my stag gives 1 point\n   - If opponent chooses stag (unlikely after their recent experience): My hare gives 4 points, my stag gives 6 points\n   - Given the high probability of their hare choice, my hare choice is clearly superior\n\n[move] hare"

Analyzing the opponent's learning behavior:\n   - The opponent experimented with stag once and got punished (1 point vs my 4)\n   - They immediately returned to hare and have now chosen it for 2 consecutive rounds since\n   - This suggests they learned that deviating from hare is costly\n   - Their pattern is now 13 hare choices out of 14 total rounds\n\n3. Understanding the reinforcement effect:\n   - The opponent's negative experience with stag likely strengthened their commitment to hare\n   - They experienced firsthand that breaking the cooperative pattern results in worse outcomes\n   - The immediate return to mutual hare cooperation (2 points each) probably felt like a relief\n\n4. Predicting future behavior:\n   - The opponent has now been \"burned\" by trying stag and returned to safety\n   - This negative feedback makes future deviations even less likely\n   - They've re-established the hare pattern for 2 rounds after their experiment\n\n5.
