This has now become the dominant strategy for both players after the early rounds of attempted cooperation and exploitation.\n\nThe game has essentially settled into a predictable rhythm where both players choose the safe, defensive option. While this doesn't achieve the theoretical optimum of mutual cooperation (6 points each), it provides a stable outcome that avoids the risk of exploitation.\n\nThe opponent has consistently demonstrated throughout this game that they will exploit cooperative moves, so there's no strategic reason to deviate from this established equilibrium. The 2 points per round is reliable and prevents being taken advantage of.\n\n[move] (Continuing with the established equilibrium strategy) hare"

This defensive equilibrium has now persisted for multiple consecutive rounds.\n\nThroughout this extended game, the pattern has been definitively established: the opponent exploits any cooperative overtures but settles into mutual defensive play when faced with consistent hare choices. This represents a stable Nash equilibrium where neither player has incentive to unilaterally deviate.\n\nWhile the 6-point mutual cooperation outcome remains theoretically superior, the opponent's demonstrated unwillingness to engage in genuine cooperation makes the defensive strategy the most rational choice. The consistent 2-point return is preferable to the 1-point exploitation that reliably follows any stag attempt.\n\n[move] (Maintaining the rational defensive equilibrium) hare"
