Current strategic situation:\n   - We're both stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium getting 2 points each\n   - The optimal outcome would be both choosing stag for 6 points each\n   - Someone needs to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n   - The question is whether to risk trusting first or continue the safe pattern\n\n4.

Game theory analysis:\n   - We're in a stable Nash equilibrium where both players choose hare\n   - Neither player has incentive to deviate unilaterally\n   - If I switch to stag, I get 1 point while they get 4\n   - The mutual hare outcome is predictable and fair\n\n4. Risk assessment for potential deviation:\n   - Probability opponent chooses hare: Very high (4 consecutive rounds)\n   - Expected payoff if I choose stag: Likely 1 point\n   - Expected payoff if I choose hare: Certain 2 points\n   - The risk-reward ratio strongly favors hare\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to hare strategy\n   - There's no indication they're planning to change or test cooperation again\n   - Playing hare ensures I maintain parity and avoid being exploited\n   - This is now the established equilibrium of our game\n\n[move] (Opponent has firmly established hare as their consistent strategy over 4 consecutive rounds, so continuing to match for stable 2-point outcomes) hare",

Risk vs. reward analysis:\n   - Current mutual hare gives us both 2 points reliably\n   - If I switch to stag: 99% chance I get 1 point, they get 4\n   - The opponent has shown zero indication of changing from hare\n   - Breaking the pattern would likely only hurt my score\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has demonstrated they prefer safety over optimization\n   - They've had multiple opportunities to signal cooperation but haven't\n   - The stable 2-2 outcome is actually reasonable given the game dynamics\n   - There's no evidence they're planning to deviate from their successful strategy\n\n[move] (The opponent has now chosen hare for 5 straight rounds with no signs of changing, maintaining the stable mutual outcome) hare",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
