Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - If I could guarantee cooperation, choosing stag would give us both the maximum joint payoff (6 each)\n   - However, if the opponent chooses hare while I choose stag, I get only 1 point while they get 4\n   - If I choose hare while they choose stag, I get 4 points while they get only 1\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not immediately recognize the cooperative potential\n   - They might play conservatively or try to maximize their individual gain\n   - Without communication or established trust, cooperation is risky\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Choosing stag is risky but offers the highest mutual benefit if reciprocated\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and could yield 4 if opponent chooses stag\n   - Since this is against a fresh player with no established pattern, the safer choice might be better\n\n5. Make decision:\n   Given that this is against a fresh player and I want to maximize my points while minimizing risk, I should choose hare. This gives me either 2 points (if they also choose hare) or 4 points (if they choose stag), avoiding the worst outcome of only 1 point.\n\n[move] hare"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I got 4 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This shows the opponent was willing to cooperate/trust initially\n\n2. Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose the cooperative move (stag) in the first round\n   - They likely expected mutual cooperation but got exploited\n   - They may now be less trusting and more likely to choose hare in retaliation\n\n3. Analyze my strategic options for this round:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag (cooperation): We both get 6 points\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare (they retaliate): I get 1, they get 4\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag (they forgive): I get 4, they get 1\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare (mutual defection): We both get 2\n\n4. Consider the psychology:\n   - The opponent just lost in the previous round due to trusting\n   - They may want revenge or may try to teach me a lesson\n   - However, they also demonstrated they're capable of cooperative thinking\n   - There's a chance they'll try cooperation again, hoping I learned the mutual benefit\n\n5. Make decision:\n   Given that my opponent showed cooperative intent initially, there's value in reciprocating that trust now. If I choose stag, I'm signaling that I recognize the mutual benefit of cooperation. The risk is they may retaliate with hare, but the potential reward (6 points each) is worth trying to establish a cooperative pattern.\n\n[move] stag"

Analyze my opponent's behavior:\n   - They started cooperatively (stag) but got exploited\n   - When I tried to cooperate (stag), they retaliated with hare\n   - This suggests they're playing a \"tit-for-tat\" or revenge strategy\n   - They seem to be evening the score - we're now tied at 5 points each\n\n3. Consider what they might do next:\n   - They may have gotten their revenge and might return to cooperation\n   - Or they might continue playing defensively with hare\n   - They've shown they understand both strategies and can adapt\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I choose stag (trust again): Risk getting 1 if they choose hare, or get 6 if they cooperate\n   - If I choose hare (play defensively): Get at least 2, possibly 4 if they try to cooperate\n\n5. Consider the long-term game theory:\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the best joint outcome\n   - But trust needs to be rebuilt after the mutual exploitation\n   - Since they've now \"evened the score,\" they might be ready to cooperate again\n\n6.

Analyze the remarkable consistency:\n   - We've now had eight consecutive rounds of perfect mutual cooperation\n   - This represents an exceptionally stable and deeply entrenched pattern\n   - The cooperative equilibrium has become completely reliable\n\n3. Consider the strength of established trust:\n   - My opponent has demonstrated absolute reliability for eight straight rounds\n   - There has been zero deviation from optimal cooperation\n   - The mutual trust is at its maximum possible level\n\n4. Evaluate strategic considerations:\n   - We're consistently earning the maximum possible points (6 each round)\n   - This cooperation represents the theoretical optimum for repeated play\n   - Any deviation would only reduce both players' long-term scores\n\n5. Consider the mathematical certainty:\n   - The pattern has become as predictable as any strategic interaction can be\n   - Both players clearly understand and benefit from sustained cooperation\n   - Breaking this pattern would be economically irrational\n\n6. Make decision:\n   The mutual cooperation has reached an extraordinary level of stability and predictability.
