Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analysis of my opponent's thinking:\n   - They broke their own pattern by not choosing hare to exploit my expected stag\n   - They chose the safer hare option, just like I did\n   - This could mean they want to reset the dynamic or avoid the risky alternating game\n   - They might be testing whether we can return to more stable play\n\n4.

Given that we both just chose the defensive option and broke the alternating pattern, this might signal a willingness to try cooperation again.

What round 8 reveals:\n   - We both simultaneously decided to attempt cooperation after the defensive round 7\n   - This suggests my opponent was also thinking about resetting to cooperation\n   - We achieved the optimal mutual outcome of 6 points each\n   - The defensive round 7 may have served as a \"cooling off\" period after the exploitation cycles\n\n3. My opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They showed willingness to cooperate by choosing stag in round 8\n   - They might want to continue this beneficial cooperation\n   - However, they also know that I exploited their cooperation before (rounds 4 and 6)\n   - They might be testing whether I'll maintain cooperation or exploit again\n\n4.

Strategic considerations:\n   - My opponent has now exploited my cooperation 3 times out of 3 attempts after round 2\n   - They clearly don't want sustained mutual cooperation\n   - I need to adapt to their exploitative strategy\n   - Choosing hare protects me and likely gives me 4 points if they follow their pattern\n\n6.

The pattern is now crystal clear:\n   - My opponent has developed a perfect counter-strategy to my moves\n   - When I choose stag (cooperation), they choose hare (exploitation)\n   - When I choose hare (defense), they choose stag (offering cooperation that I exploit)\n   - This alternating pattern has been consistent except for rounds 7-8\n\n3. My opponent's sophisticated strategy:\n   - They've learned to predict my behavior perfectly\n   - They maximize their advantage by always choosing the opposite of what would benefit me\n   - This creates a stable alternating pattern where we each get 4 points and 1 point alternately\n   - They're essentially forcing a specific game dynamic\n\n4. What they expect for round 11:\n   - Based on the perfect pattern, they likely expect me to choose stag next\n   - If I follow the pattern, I would choose stag and they would choose hare\n   - This would give me 1 point and them 4 points again\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - The alternating pattern actually gives us each an average of 2.5 points per round\n   - This is better than both choosing hare (2 points each) but worse than mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n   - My opponent seems committed to this pattern and refuses sustained cooperation\n   - If I break the pattern by choosing hare again, I either get 4 points (if they stick to expecting stag from me) or 2 points (if they also break pattern)\n\n6. Given that this pattern is so predictable and my opponent expects me to choose stag, I should break their expectation and choose hare again to either exploit their expected cooperation or at least get the safe 2 points.\n\n[move] (My opponent expects me to follow the alternating pattern and choose stag, so I'll break their expectation and choose hare to either exploit them or stay safe) hare"

Significance of this development:\n   - My opponent also recognized the predictable pattern and chose to break it\n   - They chose the defensive option instead of offering cooperation for me to exploit\n   - This suggests they might be getting tired of the alternating cycle\n   - We're both now playing more cautiously\n\n3.

Critical pattern analysis:\n   - Round 12: Both stag \u2192 Round 13: Both hare \u2192 Round 14: Both stag\n   - My opponent showed restraint in round 13 (didn't exploit) and then cooperated again in round 14\n   - This suggests they may have evolved beyond the pure exploitation strategy\n   - We're potentially entering a more mature, cooperative phase of the game\n\n3.
