Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider that this is against a \"fresh player\":\n   - They may not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with intuition\n   - They might not anticipate the strategic complexity\n\n4. Determine optimal strategy:\n   - Hare dominates stag from a pure self-interest perspective\n   - Regardless of what the opponent does, hare either matches or beats stag for my payoff\n   - This is a classic prisoner's dilemma structure where mutual cooperation (stag) is best overall, but defection (hare) is individually rational\n\n5. Final reasoning:\n   - Since the opponent is fresh and may not coordinate, and hare is the dominant strategy for maximizing my individual points, I should choose hare.\n\n[move] hare"

Interpret the opponent's sudden strategy change:\n   - They may have gotten bored with the repetitive 2-point outcomes\n   - They might be testing if I'll reciprocate cooperation now\n   - Could be attempting to break the deadlock and establish mutual stag play (6 points each)\n   - Possibly hoping I've become predictable and will switch to stag\n\n3. Consider the opponent's likely thinking for the next round:\n   - They just got punished again (1 point) for choosing stag\n   - They might return to hare immediately, having been reminded why they stopped playing stag\n   - Or they might try stag one more time, hoping I'll cooperate this round\n   - Their previous learning pattern suggests they'll likely revert to hare quickly\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays hare (likely): I should play hare (2 vs 1)\n   - If opponent plays stag again: I should play hare (4 vs 6)\n   - Playing stag risks getting only 1 point if they return to their learned hare strategy\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - The opponent's deviation doesn't change the fundamental game theory\n   - Hare still dominates stag mathematically\n   - Their experiment just earned them 1 point instead of 2, reinforcing why hare is better\n   - Most likely they'll return to hare after this reminder\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - One deviation doesn't invalidate the dominant strategy\n   - Hare continues to be optimal regardless of their choice\n   - Consistency with proven approach remains best\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze the recent shift:\n   - Rounds 4-9: Both played hare (stable equilibrium)\n   - Round 10: I hare, opponent stag (I got 4, opponent got 1)\n   - Round 11: I hare, opponent stag (I got 4, opponent got 1)\n   - The opponent has now chosen stag twice in a row after 6 rounds of hare\n   - My total: 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 30 points\n\n2. Interpret this strategic shift:\n   - The opponent may be deliberately trying to establish cooperation again\n   - They might be willing to take short-term losses (1 point each round) to signal cooperative intent\n   - This mirrors their behavior in rounds 2-3, where they also played stag twice consecutively\n   - They could be testing if I'll eventually reciprocate after seeing their commitment\n\n3. Consider the opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They may have calculated that mutual stag (6 points each) is better than mutual hare (2 points each)\n   - They might be trying to break out of the lower-payoff equilibrium\n   - However, they're getting punished again just like in rounds 2-3\n   - Their persistence suggests a deliberate strategy rather than random play\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I'm benefiting enormously from their stag choices (4 points per round)\n   - Hare continues to be optimal whether they play hare or stag\n   - If I switch to stag and they continue: we both get 6 points\n   - If I switch to stag and they revert to hare: I get only 1 point\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - The opponent's commitment to stag for two rounds suggests they might continue\n   - But their previous learning pattern (rounds 2-3 then switching to hare) suggests they'll eventually give up\n   - Hare guarantees excellent outcomes against their current strategy\n   - No compelling reason to risk cooperation when exploitation is working perfectly\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Continue capitalizing on their cooperative attempts\n   - Hare remains the dominant strategy\n   - Let them learn again that stag doesn't work against consistent hare play\n\n[move] hare"

Identify the opponent's behavioral pattern:\n   - They seem to periodically test cooperation with stag\n   - Each time they try stag twice, get punished, then return to hare\n   - This suggests they understand the game but occasionally attempt to break the equilibrium\n   - They consistently learn from being exploited and revert to rational play\n\n3. Predict likely future behavior:\n   - Based on the previous cycle, they'll probably stick with hare for multiple rounds now\n   - They've been reminded again why stag doesn't work against my consistent strategy\n   - The pattern suggests they need time to \"recover\" from being exploited before trying cooperation again\n   - Most likely we'll return to stable mutual hare play\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic advantage:\n   - My consistent hare strategy has been incredibly effective\n   - I've maximized points during both exploitation phases (rounds 2-3 and 10-11)\n   - I've maintained steady points during equilibrium phases\n   - The opponent's predictable learning cycle benefits me greatly\n\n5. Consider long-term dynamics:\n   - The opponent may eventually try stag again after several rounds of hare\n   - But each time they do, I benefit by staying with hare\n   - This creates a cycle where I consistently outperform over time\n   - Hare remains optimal regardless of which phase of their cycle they're in\n\n6.
