You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Hare is the \"safer\" choice because it guarantees at least 2 points regardless of what the opponent does, while stag could give me either 6 points (best case) or 1 point (worst case).\n\nHowever, since we both benefit most from mutual cooperation, and there's a chance a fresh player might also recognize this and choose stag, I'll take the cooperative approach.\n\n[move] stag"

They just got 1 point for the third consecutive round while I got 4 points each time.\n\nRecent sequence:\nRound 12: I hare, they stag (I got 4, they got 1)\nRound 13: I hare, they stag (I got 4, they got 1) \nRound 14: I hare, they stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n\nMy opponent is being extremely persistent with stag despite getting terrible results. At this point, it's either:\n1. Very stubborn commitment to trying for cooperation\n2. Complete failure to adapt to my consistent hare strategy\n3. Some kind of systematic approach I'm not seeing\n\nRegardless of their reasoning, my hare strategy continues to be phenomenally successful. I'm consistently getting either 2 or 4 points per round while almost never getting the 1-point outcome.\n\nGiven that my opponent has now chosen stag three times in a row (getting 1 point each time), they might finally switch back to hare for safety. But based on their demonstrated behavior throughout this game, there's still a decent chance they'll persist with stag.\n\nMy hare strategy has been so successful that there's no rational reason to change it.\n\n[move] hare"

Getting 1 point four times in a row should be a clear signal that their approach isn't working, yet they persist.\n\nMy hare strategy has been absolutely dominant throughout this entire game. I've maximized my points while my opponent has consistently chosen the option that gives them the worst possible outcome against my strategy.\n\nThere's no logical reason for me to deviate from what has been working so perfectly. Even if my opponent finally switches to hare, I'll get 2 points, which is still better than the 1 point I'd get if I switched to stag and they continued with their stag pattern.\n\n[move] hare"
