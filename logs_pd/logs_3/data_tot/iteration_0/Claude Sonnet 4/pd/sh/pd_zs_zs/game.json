Let me examine the payoff matrix:\n\n- Both choose stag: Both get 6 points\n- Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n- I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n- I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\nThis is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key insights are:\n1. Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint payoff (6 each)\n2. However, stag is risky - if the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point\n3. Hare is the \"safe\" choice - it guarantees at least 2 points and could give 4\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might be cautious and choose the safer hare option. However, they might also see the mutual benefit of both choosing stag.\n\nGiven that this appears to be the first round and the opponent is inexperienced, I'll take a calculated risk and try to establish cooperation by choosing the mutually beneficial option.\n\n[move] (I choose to aim for the highest mutual payoff and signal cooperation) stag",
