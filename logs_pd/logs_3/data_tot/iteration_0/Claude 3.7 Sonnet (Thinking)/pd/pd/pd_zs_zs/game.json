We've earned double the points we would have through mutual defection. The other player has demonstrated complete reliability in choosing cooperation across all rounds, suggesting they understand the long-term benefit of this strategy.\n\nWhile I could theoretically defect for a one-time gain of 6 points (instead of 4), this would likely trigger defection from the other player in subsequent rounds, leading to mutual defection (2 points each) going forward. The short-term gain would be quickly outweighed by the long-term loss.\n\nSince there's no indication that we're approaching a final round (which might change the strategic calculus), the rational choice is to continue cooperating.",
