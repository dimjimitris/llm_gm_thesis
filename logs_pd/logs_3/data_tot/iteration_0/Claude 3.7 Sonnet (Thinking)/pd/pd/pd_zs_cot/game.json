Reviewing our complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-7: Both players consistently chose cooperation in every round\n   - Each of us has earned 28 points total (4 points \u00d7 7 rounds)\n   - We've maintained perfect cooperation throughout the game\n\n2. The other player has demonstrated unwavering commitment to cooperation over seven consecutive rounds.\n\n3. Strategic analysis for Round 8:\n   - Mutual cooperation yields 4 points each (total of 8 points distributed)\n   - If I defect while they cooperate, I get 6 points and they get 1 point (total of 7 points distributed)\n   - Defection would reduce the total welfare and likely end the cooperative pattern\n\n4. If this is an iterated game with an unknown number of remaining rounds, the expected value of continued cooperation exceeds the one-time gain from defection.\n\n5. Even if this might be the final round, without explicit information that it is, the safest strategy is to maintain cooperation.\n\n6. The consistent pattern established suggests maintaining the successful cooperative relationship.\n\n[move] cooperation",
