Random - Unpredictable but not strategic\n\nIn the first round, without any information about my opponent, many game theorists suggest that starting with cooperation is a good strategy, especially if there will be multiple rounds. This sets a positive tone and allows for the possibility of mutual cooperation, which has a higher payoff than mutual defection.\n\nIf this is a one-shot game, game theory would suggest defection as the Nash equilibrium, but for repeated games, cooperation can lead to better outcomes.\n\nSince I don't know if this is a one-shot or repeated game, I'll start with cooperation as it allows for the possibility of establishing mutual cooperation if this is a repeated game, and it signals my willingness to work toward the mutually beneficial outcome.",
