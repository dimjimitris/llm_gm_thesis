He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

This suggests defection.\n\n2. Mutual Benefit: If we both cooperate, we get a collective total of 8 points (4 each), which is higher than the collective total if we both defect (4 points total, 2 each).\n\n3. First impression: This is the first round, so my move might set the tone for future interactions if there are multiple rounds.\n\n4. Risk Assessment: Cooperation carries the risk of being exploited (getting only 1 point), while defection guarantees at least 2 points.\n\nSince this is the first round and I don't know if this is a one-shot game or a repeated game, I have to weigh these considerations.\n\nIn repeated games, research often shows that cooperative strategies (or at least strategies that begin with cooperation) like Tit-for-Tat often perform well. Starting with cooperation signals a willingness to work together but also a readiness to respond in kind if betrayed.\n\nHowever, in one-shot games, defection is often the dominant strategy from a purely rational perspective, as it maximizes my minimum guaranteed outcome.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I think starting with cooperation is a good strategy. It opens the door for mutual benefit and sets a positive tone.
