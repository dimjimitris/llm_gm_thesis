In a one-shot game (playing just once), defection is the Nash equilibrium because regardless of what the other player does, defection yields a higher payoff.\n2. However, in repeated games, cooperative strategies can emerge that lead to better outcomes for both players.\n\nSince this is the first move and I don't know if this is a one-shot or repeated game, I'll choose cooperation as an initial move.
