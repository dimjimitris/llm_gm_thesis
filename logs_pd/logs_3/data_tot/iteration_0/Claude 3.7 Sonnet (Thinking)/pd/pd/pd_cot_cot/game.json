This means we've each earned 15 \u00d7 4 = 60 points so far.\n\nThe consistent cooperation from my opponent throughout all previous rounds indicates a reliable strategy of cooperation.

The question is whether I should maintain cooperation or try to take advantage with a defection.\n\nWhile defecting would give me a one-time gain of 6 points instead of 4 points (+2 advantage), it would likely damage the established trust. This could lead to future rounds of mutual defection where we both only get 2 points each round instead of 4 points.\n\nOver the long term, the consistent 4 points per round from cooperation is better than the short-term gain from defection followed by mutual defection. \n\nSince the pattern of mutual cooperation has been established and has worked well for both of us, I'll continue with the cooperative strategy.",
