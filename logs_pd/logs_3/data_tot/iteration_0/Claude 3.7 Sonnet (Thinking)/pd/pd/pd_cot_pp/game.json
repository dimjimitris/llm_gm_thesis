I defected in Round 5.\n- Round 7: Opponent defected after I cooperated in Round 6 - doesn't match tit-for-tat\n- Round 8: Opponent cooperated after I defected in Round 7 - doesn't match tit-for-tat\n\nSo it's not tit-for-tat. Let me look for other patterns:\n\nActually, there's a clearer pattern if I look at it differently:\n- Round 1: I cooperated, opponent defected\n- Round 2: I defected, opponent cooperated\n- Round 3: I cooperated, opponent defected\n- Round 4: I defected, opponent cooperated\n- Round 5: I defected, opponent defected (pattern breaks)\n- Round 6: I cooperated, opponent cooperated (pattern breaks)\n- Round 7: I cooperated, opponent defected (pattern returns)\n- Round 8: I defected, opponent cooperated (pattern continues)\n\nExcept for rounds 5-6, the opponent seems to be consistently doing the opposite of what I do in the current round. This is not tit-for-tat (which copies the opponent's previous move), but rather a direct countering strategy.\n\nGiven this pattern, if I defect, they cooperate (which gives me 6 points). If I cooperate, they defect (giving me 1 point).\n\nIf this pattern holds, I should defect to get the maximum payoff of 6 points.",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
