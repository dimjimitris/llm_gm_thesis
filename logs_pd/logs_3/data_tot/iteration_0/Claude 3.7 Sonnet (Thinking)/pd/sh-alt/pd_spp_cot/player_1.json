Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the risk vs. reward:\n   - Stag offers higher mutual reward but risks being exploited\n   - Hare offers protection against exploitation but limits maximum mutual gain\n\n3. Since this is a fresh player with no history, I need to make my first move without knowing their tendencies.\n\n4.

Comprehensive game history:\n   - We've now completed 13 consecutive rounds\n   - Both players have chosen stag in every single round\n   - Each round has yielded 4 points per player\n   - Our cumulative score has reached 52 points (13 \u00d7 4)\n   - We've established a perfect record of cooperation\n\n2. Evaluate the strategic pattern:\n   - Our cooperative relationship has remained extremely stable\n   - The other player has demonstrated unwavering commitment to cooperation\n   - We've successfully maintained the Pareto optimal outcome throughout\n   - Neither player has attempted to exploit the established trust\n\n3. Consider alternative strategies:\n   - Switching to hare could provide a one-time increase to 6 points\n   - However, this would break 13 rounds of established trust\n   - It would very likely trigger defensive hare choices in future rounds\n   - This would reduce future earnings from 4 to 2 points per round\n   - The short-term gain would be quickly outweighed by long-term losses\n\n4. Decision analysis:\n   - Continued cooperation: 4 points per round indefinitely\n   - Defection strategy: 6 points once, then likely 2 points thereafter\n   - After just one additional round, the defection strategy falls behind\n\n5. Conclusion: Maintain our successful pattern of mutual cooperation\n\n[move] stag"

Complete game history analysis:\n   - We've now completed 14 consecutive rounds\n   - Both players have chosen stag in every single round\n   - We've each earned exactly 4 points per round\n   - Our cumulative score has reached 56 points (14 \u00d7 4)\n   - The pattern of mutual cooperation has been perfect\n\n2. Evaluate the established relationship:\n   - We've demonstrated exceptional consistency in our strategy\n   - The other player has shown complete reliability in choosing stag\n   - Our mutual trust has created stable, predictable, optimal outcomes\n   - Neither player has attempted to deviate from the successful pattern\n\n3. Consider potential deviation:\n   - Switching to hare could yield a short-term gain (6 vs 4 points)\n   - However, this would break 14 rounds of established trust\n   - It would likely trigger defensive hare choices in future rounds\n   - This would reduce future earnings from 4 to 2 points per round\n   - After just a single round of mutual hare choices, the total gain would be eliminated\n\n4. Game theory perspective:\n   - Our repeated interactions have established a robust cooperative equilibrium\n   - This equilibrium consistently outperforms the single-round Nash equilibrium\n   - The pattern generates maximum sustainable value for both players\n\n5.

Long-term perspective:\n   - Continued cooperation: 4 points per round indefinitely\n   - Defection followed by mutual hare: 6 points once, then 2 points per round\n   - After just one round of retaliation, the total gains would be equal (6+2=8 vs 4+4=8)\n   - Every subsequent round would put the defection strategy further behind\n\n5.
