    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Stag vs Stag: 4 points each (Pareto optimal)\n- Hare vs Hare: 2 points each (risk-dominant)\n- Stag vs Hare: 1 point vs 6 points (worst outcome for stag player)\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first round with a fresh player, we have no prior information about their tendencies. In initial rounds, players often choose cooperation to establish goodwill, though some may exploit this by choosing hare.\n\nRisk Analyst: The stag choice maximizes potential joint reward but exposes you to significant downside if the opponent chooses hare. The hare choice guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6 points.\n\nDecision Strategist: For the first move, I recommend choosing stag to signal cooperative intent. While it carries risk, it establishes a foundation for mutual benefit. If the opponent chooses hare, we can adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\n[move] stag I choose cooperation for mutual benefit in this first round."

You've established a cooperative foundation.\n\nRisk Analyst: With demonstrated cooperative behavior, the risk of choosing stag again is reduced compared to the first round. Maintaining this equilibrium is advantageous.\n\nDecision Strategist: Continuing with stag is strategic here - it reinforces the cooperative pattern and signals your intent to maintain mutual benefit. The established pattern of cooperation typically persists unless disrupted.\n\n[move] stag I'll continue cooperation to maintain our mutually beneficial arrangement."

Two rounds of stag choices suggest a potentially stable cooperative relationship. Disrupting this pattern without reason would likely damage this established trust.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk profile has improved further after two successful cooperative rounds. The likelihood of the opponent deviating from the established pattern has decreased, making stag an even safer choice.\n\nDecision Strategist: With this established pattern, continuing with stag offers the highest expected value.

The expected value of continuing with stag remains higher than attempting to exploit with hare.\n\nDecision Strategist: Continuing with stag is optimal. While hare could yield a one-time gain of 6 points (if they maintain stag), it would disrupt the established pattern and likely lead to mutual hare choices in subsequent rounds, reducing your long-term gains.\n\n[move] stag I'll continue our successful cooperation pattern for consistent mutual benefit."
