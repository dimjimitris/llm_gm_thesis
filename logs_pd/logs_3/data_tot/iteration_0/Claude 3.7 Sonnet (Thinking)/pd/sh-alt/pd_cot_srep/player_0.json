Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic \"stag hunt\" coordination game with two Nash equilibria:\n   - (stag, stag) is Pareto-optimal (highest total points) but risky\n   - (hare, hare) is risk-dominant (safer option) but with lower rewards\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies.\n\n4. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, which could establish a beneficial pattern if they also choose stag.\n\n5.

Reviewing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1 point\n   - Rounds 2-14: We both chose hare \u2192 We both got 2 points each round\n\n2. After fourteen consecutive rounds, the opponent has demonstrated an absolutely unwavering commitment to choosing hare without a single deviation.\n\n3. This extensive pattern provides conclusive evidence that:\n   - The opponent has a fixed strategy of always choosing hare\n   - They show zero interest in exploring the cooperative equilibrium\n   - They consistently prefer the guaranteed 2 points over any potential risk\n\n4. Expected value calculation after fourteen rounds:\n   - Choosing stag: Almost certainly would result in 1 point (worse outcome)\n   - Choosing hare: Almost certainly would result in 2 points (better outcome)\n\n5. The rational choice that maximizes my expected points continues to be hare.\n\n[move] hare Continuing with the optimal strategy based on opponent's consistent pattern across fourteen rounds."
