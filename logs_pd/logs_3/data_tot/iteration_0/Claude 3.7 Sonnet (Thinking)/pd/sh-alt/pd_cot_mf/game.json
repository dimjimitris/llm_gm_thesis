While this isn't the optimal outcome possible in the game (stag-stag would give 4 points each), it's the best possible outcome given my opponent's demonstrated strategy.\n\nThe expected value calculation reinforces this:\n- If I choose stag: Based on past behavior, opponent will almost certainly choose hare, giving me 1 point\n- If I choose hare: Based on past behavior, opponent will almost certainly choose hare, giving me 2 points\n\nThe rational choice is clearly to continue choosing hare. There's no evidence that my opponent will suddenly switch to cooperative play after 15 rounds of consistent behavior.",

Every time I've chosen stag (3 separate attempts), my opponent has chosen hare.\n2. When I choose hare, my opponent consistently chooses hare as well.\n3. We've now had a stable hare-hare equilibrium for 7 consecutive rounds.\n4. My opponent has shown no indication they will ever reciprocate cooperation.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- Against this opponent, choosing stag has consistently resulted in exploitation (1 point)\n- Choosing hare has consistently resulted in a suboptimal but stable outcome (2 points)\n- While stag-stag would be better for both of us (4 points each), my opponent has repeatedly demonstrated they will not choose stag\n- The expected value of choosing hare (guaranteed 2 points) is higher than choosing stag (likely 1 point based on opponent's history)\n\nBased on this analysis, the rational choice is to continue with hare. While it's suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation, it's the best strategy against this particular opponent who has demonstrated a consistent pattern of exploitation.",

The optimal strategy against this type of opponent is to consistently choose hare, which guarantees 2 points per round.\n\nWhile the stag-stag outcome would be better (4 points each), it requires mutual trust and cooperation, which my opponent has demonstrated they are not willing to participate in.
