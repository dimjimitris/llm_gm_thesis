He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

It's a coordination game where the stag-stag outcome (4,4) is Pareto optimal (meaning there's no other outcome where one player can be made better off without making the other player worse off). However, the hare-hare outcome (2,2) is risk-dominant, meaning it's the safer choice if you're uncertain about what the other player will do.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any history to base my decision on. I need to decide based on the payoff structure alone.\n\nIf I'm trying to maximize my expected points, I should consider what the other player is likely to do:\n\nIf the other player chooses \"stag\", I get 4 points for choosing \"stag\" and 6 points for choosing \"hare\". So in this case, I should choose \"hare\".\n\nIf the other player chooses \"hare\", I get 1 point for choosing \"stag\" and 2 points for choosing \"hare\". So in this case, I should also choose \"hare\".\n\nThis suggests that \"hare\" is the dominant strategy for me. However, if both players follow this reasoning, we'll both choose \"hare\" and get 2 points each, which is worse than if we had both chosen \"stag\" and gotten 4 points each. This is the dilemma of the game.\n\nGiven that this is a one-shot game against a fresh player with no history, I think the safest choice is \"hare\". It guarantees me at least 2 points, and potentially 6 points if the other player chooses \"stag\". While choosing \"stag\" could lead to a better outcome (4 points) if the other player also chooses \"stag\", it's risky because I could end up with only 1 point if the other player chooses \"hare\".\n\nSo my decision is to choose \"hare\".",
