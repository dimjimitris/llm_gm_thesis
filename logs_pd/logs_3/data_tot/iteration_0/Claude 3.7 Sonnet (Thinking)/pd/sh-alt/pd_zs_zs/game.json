However, there is a temptation to defect by choosing hare while the other player chooses stag, which would give me 6 points (maximum possible) and the other player only 1 point.\n\nThis is a classic stag hunt game, where mutual cooperation (stag-stag) yields the best collective outcome, but there's a risk-dominant strategy (hare) that provides some security against being exploited.\n\nSince the other player has consistently chosen stag for 12 rounds, it seems they're committed to cooperation. I could:\n\n1. Continue choosing stag - maintain mutual cooperation and get 4 points consistently\n2. Try choosing hare - potentially get 6 points if they continue choosing stag, but risk establishing a pattern of defection that could lead to both of us choosing hare in future rounds (only 2 points each)\n\nGiven the consistent cooperation so far and the risk of breaking that pattern, I think continuing with stag is the most rational choice. If I defect once, it might break the trust and lead to worse outcomes overall in subsequent rounds.\n\nI'll continue with stag.",
