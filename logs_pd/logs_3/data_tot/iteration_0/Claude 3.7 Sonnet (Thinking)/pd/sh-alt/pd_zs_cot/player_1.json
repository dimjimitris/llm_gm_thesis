Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is the first round with a new player, so I have no prior information about their strategy.\n\n3. The collectively optimal outcome is for both of us to choose stag (total 8 points), but it requires mutual trust.\n\n4. Choosing hare is safer - I'll get at least 2 points, or possibly 6 if they choose stag.\n\n5. However, since this might be a repeated game, signaling willingness to cooperate could be beneficial for establishing mutual trust.\n\n6. I'll choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for the mutually beneficial outcome. If my opponent also cooperates, we both get a good payoff (4 points each).\n\n[move] stag"

Evaluating our complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-15: Both players chose stag in all fifteen rounds\n   - Each player has accumulated 60 points total (4 points \u00d7 15 rounds)\n\n2. We've established an extremely stable cooperative equilibrium that has persisted without any deviation for fifteen consecutive rounds.\n\n3. My opponent has shown perfect consistency and reliability, choosing stag in every single round.\n\n4. Our mutual strategy continues to generate the optimal sustainable outcome (4 points per round).\n\n5. Economic analysis of potential deviation:\n   - A one-time switch to hare would yield 6 points (only 2 more than cooperation)\n   - This would very likely destroy our established pattern of trust\n   - Subsequent rounds would probably yield only 2 points each (mutual hare)\n   - After just two rounds of mutual hare following defection, I would be at a net loss:\n     - Defection path: 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 points over three rounds\n     - Cooperation path: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 points over three rounds\n\n6. With fifteen rounds of successful cooperation already completed and clear mathematical advantages to maintaining it, continuing our proven strategy remains optimal.\n\n[move] stag"
