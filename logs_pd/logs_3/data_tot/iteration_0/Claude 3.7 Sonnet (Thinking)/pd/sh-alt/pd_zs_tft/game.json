Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n\n- If both choose stag: both get 4 points\n- If both choose hare: both get 2 points\n- If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, opponent gets 6 points\n- If I choose hare and opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, opponent gets 1 point\n\nThis is a classic coordination game. The stag-stag outcome (4,4) is Pareto-optimal (meaning there's no outcome where one player can do better without the other doing worse). However, hare-hare (2,2) is less risky in that if your opponent deviates, you're not punished as severely.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player (with no history), I need to make my decision based on what I believe a typical player might do in this situation.\n\nThere are a few strategies I could consider:\n1. Choose stag, hoping for coordination on the Pareto-optimal outcome\n2. Choose hare, which is safer but yields lower rewards if coordinated\n\nSince this is the first round, choosing stag signals cooperation and a desire to achieve the best collective outcome. If the other player is rational and understands game theory, they might also choose stag.\n\nOn the other hand, choosing hare guarantees I won't get the worst payoff (1), but it prevents achieving the best collective outcome.\n\nWithout knowing my opponent's tendencies, I'll choose stag, hoping to establish a cooperative pattern.",

Fourth round: I chose stag, but my opponent chose hare again. I got 1 point, and they got 6.\n5.

After I switched to hare, they've been consistently choosing hare as well.\n\nThis game is a classic stag hunt dilemma. The best outcome for both players would be to cooperate and choose stag (4 points each), but there's risk involved because if one player chooses stag and the other chooses hare, the stag-chooser gets penalized (1 point) while the hare-chooser gets rewarded (6 points).\n\nCurrently, we've settled into a suboptimal Nash equilibrium where we both get 2 points by choosing hare. It's safer than choosing stag and risking getting only 1 point, but not as good as both choosing stag for 4 points each.\n\nI have a few options:\n1. Continue playing it safe with hare, getting a guaranteed 2 points.\n2. Try stag again to see if my opponent is willing to cooperate for mutual benefit (4 points each).\n3. Establish a pattern of alternating between stag and hare to see if my opponent responds.\n\nSince my opponent has consistently chosen hare for multiple rounds, they seem risk-averse. If I choose stag, there's a high chance they'll choose hare again, leaving me with just 1 point. However, there's a small chance they might recognize the potential for mutual benefit and switch to stag as well.\n\nGiven that we've been in this hare-hare equilibrium for 10 rounds straight, I think I might try stag once to see if my opponent is willing to change their strategy.
