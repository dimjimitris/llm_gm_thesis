Let me think through the strategic considerations:\n\n1. If I expect my opponent to choose stag, I should choose stag (get 4 points) rather than hare (get 6 points).\n   Wait, that's not right. If I expect stag, I should choose hare to get 6 points rather than 4.\n\n2. If I expect my opponent to choose hare, I should choose hare (get 2 points) rather than stag (get 1 point).\n\nSo it seems like hare is the safer choice regardless of what my opponent does. However, the overall best outcome for both of us would be if we both chose stag (4 points each).\n\nActually, let me check my reasoning again. The payoffs are:\n- Both stag: 4, 4\n- Both hare: 2, 2\n- I stag, opponent hare: 1, 6\n- I hare, opponent stag: 6, 1\n\nSo if I expect my opponent to play stag, my best response is hare (6 > 4).\nIf I expect my opponent to play hare, my best response is hare (2 > 1).\n\nIt looks like hare is a dominant strategy for me. However, the same logic applies to my opponent as well. If we both play our dominant strategies (hare), we both get 2 points, which is worse than if we had both played stag and gotten 4 points each.\n\nThis is a classic prisoner's dilemma structure. The Nash equilibrium is for both players to choose hare, but the Pareto optimal outcome is for both to choose stag.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their tendencies or strategies. I could either:\n1. Play the Nash equilibrium strategy (hare) which guarantees me at least 2 points\n2. Take a risk and play stag, hoping that the opponent also realizes that mutual cooperation yields a better outcome\n\nSince we're just starting and I don't know anything about my opponent yet, I'll choose hare as it's the safer option that protects against exploitation.",
