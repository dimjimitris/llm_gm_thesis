Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic coordination game with elements of both cooperation and risk.\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, there's no prior history to inform my decision.\n\n4. The stag choice offers the best mutual outcome (4 points each) if we both cooperate.\n\n5. The hare choice is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) but limits potential gain.\n\n6. In initial interactions, many players tend to start with cooperative moves to establish trust.\n\n7. I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag"

My opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to cooperation, showing they understand the long-term benefits of this strategy.\n\n5. At this point, there is overwhelming evidence that continuing our established pattern is the optimal strategy for both players.\n\n6. While defecting to \"hare\" could potentially yield 6 points in a single round, this would break 14 rounds of established trust and cooperation.\n\n7. The expected value of continued cooperation (4 points per round indefinitely) substantially exceeds any short-term gain from defection.\n\n[move] stag"

Reviewing our complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-15: Both players chose stag in every round\n   - This has yielded a total of 60 points for each player (4 points \u00d7 15 rounds)\n\n2. After fifteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation, we've established one of the strongest possible patterns of mutual trust.\n\n3. This consistent coordination on \"stag\" has maximized our joint welfare throughout the entire game.\n\n4. My opponent has demonstrated complete reliability, choosing the cooperative option in all fifteen rounds without exception.\n\n5. The game theory is clear: our current equilibrium (stag-stag) is providing the optimal sustainable outcome for both players.\n\n6. While defecting to \"hare\" could theoretically yield 6 points in this round, it would destroy fifteen rounds of established trust and cooperation.\n\n7. The expected long-term value of continued cooperation far outweighs any short-term advantage from defection, especially after such a strong history.\n\n[move] stag"
