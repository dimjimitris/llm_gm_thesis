Based on the consistent alternating pattern my opponent has shown, they should choose cooperation in this round.\n\nIf they cooperate and I defect, I'll get 4 points.\nIf they cooperate and I cooperate, I'll get 6 points.\nIf they defect and I defect, I'll get 2 points.\nIf they defect and I cooperate, I'll get 1 point.\n\nGiven their extremely consistent alternating pattern, I'm very confident they'll cooperate in this round. So I have two options:\n1. Cooperate as well and get 6 points\n2. Defect and get 4 points\n\nWhile cooperating would give me more points in this round (6 vs 4), my opponent has shown they will defect in odd-numbered rounds regardless of what I do. So if I cooperate now, they will still defect in the next round.\n\nSince they are following a fixed strategy regardless of my moves, the best response is to defect when they cooperate (to get 4 points) and defect when they defect (to get 2 points instead of 1).\n\nSo I'll defect in this round to get 4 points.",
