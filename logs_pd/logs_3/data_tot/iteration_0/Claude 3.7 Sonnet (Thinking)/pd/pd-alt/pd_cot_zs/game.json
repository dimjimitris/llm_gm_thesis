This has resulted in 6 points per round for both players (15 \u00d7 6 = 90 points total for me).\n3. The other player has shown absolute consistency in choosing cooperation.\n4. Our mutual cooperation has established the optimal equilibrium for both players.\n\nI need to decide whether to cooperate or defect for this round. Let me analyze both options:\n\nIf I cooperate:\n- If the other player cooperates (which they have done consistently so far): I get 6 points\n- If the other player defects (which would be a sudden change): I get 1 point\n\nIf I defect:\n- If the other player cooperates (likely based on past behavior): I get 4 points\n- If the other player defects (unlikely based on past behavior): I get 2 points\n\nAnalyzing the expected value:\n- Cooperation has consistently yielded 6 points per round\n- Defection would actually yield fewer points (4 points) against a cooperating player\n- Defection would also risk destroying our established pattern of mutual trust\n- If the trust is broken, we might fall into a pattern of mutual defection (2 points each)\n\nThe rational choice is clear: continue with cooperation. It maximizes points in this round and preserves the optimal equilibrium for future rounds. There is no strategic advantage to defecting at this point.",
