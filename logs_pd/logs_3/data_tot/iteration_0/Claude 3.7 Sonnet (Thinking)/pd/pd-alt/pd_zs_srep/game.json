But if we both cooperate, we each get 6 points.\n\nHowever, based on the overall history, my opponent has exploited my cooperation more often than not. We're now in a pattern of mutual defection, which is at least stable at 2 points per round.\n\nI think I'll try cooperation one more time to see if we can break out of this negative spiral.
