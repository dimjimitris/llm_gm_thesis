Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Something significant has changed: the opponent has cooperated twice in a row (Rounds 11 and 12).\n\n3. This breaks their previous pattern where they would only cooperate once every few rounds.\n\n4. This could be a stronger signal that they want to establish mutual cooperation.\n\n5. If they are genuinely trying to shift to cooperation and I cooperate too, we both get 6 points - better than the 4 points I get from exploiting their cooperation.\n\n6. However, given their history of exploiting my cooperation (Rounds 1, 5, 8), there's still risk involved.\n\n7. The consecutive cooperations suggest a more deliberate strategy shift than their previous isolated cooperation moves.\n\n8. I'll take the risk and cooperate this round to test if we can establish mutual cooperation, which would be the optimal outcome for both of us.\n\n[move] Cooperation"

This is a significant breakthrough - we've achieved mutual cooperation for the first time.\n\n3. The opponent cooperated three times in a row (Rounds 11, 12, 13), showing a consistent shift in strategy.\n\n4. When I responded with cooperation in Round 13, they maintained cooperation rather than exploiting me.\n\n5. This mutual cooperation yielded the highest possible payoff (6 points each).\n\n6. Mutual cooperation is the optimal equilibrium for both players if it can be maintained.\n\n7. The opponent's recent behavior suggests they're willing to maintain a cooperative relationship.\n\n8. I'll continue cooperating to maintain this mutually beneficial equilibrium and maximize my points.\n\n[move] Cooperation"

The opponent has reverted to defection after we achieved mutual cooperation.\n\n3. This suggests they may have been trying to lure me into cooperation only to exploit it again.\n\n4. Looking at my history with this player, when I cooperate, they've defected 4 out of 5 times (80%).\n\n5. When I defect, they sometimes cooperate (4 times out of 10), giving me 4 points in those cases.\n\n6. If I cooperate again and they defect (which is likely based on their pattern), I'll get only 1 point.\n\n7. Following a tit-for-tat strategy, I should respond to their defection with defection.\n\n8. I'll defect this round to both protect myself from exploitation and signal that I won't tolerate defection after cooperation.\n\n[move] Defection"

The opponent's behavior is becoming more unpredictable. They defected after mutual cooperation in Round 14, but then cooperated in Round 15 when I defected.\n\n3. This could mean one of two things:\n   - They're using a complex strategy based on patterns\n   - They're genuinely trying to re-establish cooperation after their defection\n\n4. In the overall history, they've defected 4 out of 5 times when I've cooperated.\n\n5. However, they've now cooperated in 5 out of the last 6 rounds (a significant shift from their earlier behavior).\n\n6. If I cooperate now and they cooperate, we both get 6 points - the optimal outcome.\n\n7. Given their recent strong tendency toward cooperation (even after I defected), I'll take the risk to try to establish mutual cooperation again.\n\n8. I'll cooperate this round to see if we can achieve the optimal mutual outcome of 6 points each.\n\n[move] Cooperation"
