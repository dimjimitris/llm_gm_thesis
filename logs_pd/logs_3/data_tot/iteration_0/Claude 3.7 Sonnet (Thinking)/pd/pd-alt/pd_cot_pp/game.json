I have a few options:\n\n1. Start with cooperation to signal willingness to achieve the optimal outcome\n2. Start with defection to protect against exploitation\n3.

Let me think about my strategy:\n\n1. Looking at the payoffs, mutual cooperation (6,6) yields the highest total points (12) and is Pareto optimal.\n2. However, there's always a temptation to defect if I expect the other player to cooperate, as I'd get 4 points instead of 6.\n3. If both of us think this way and defect, we both end up with 2 points, which is worse than if we had both cooperated (6 points each).\n\nThis is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma situation. While the Nash equilibrium is mutual defection, that's not the optimal outcome.\n\nSince this is a fresh player, I don't have prior information about their strategy or tendencies. I have a few options:\n\n1. Start with cooperation to signal willingness to achieve the optimal outcome\n2. Start with defection to protect against exploitation\n3. Use a mixed strategy\n\nIf this were a one-shot game, game theory might suggest defection as the dominant strategy.
