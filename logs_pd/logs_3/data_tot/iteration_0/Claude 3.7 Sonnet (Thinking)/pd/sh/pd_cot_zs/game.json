This is the optimal cooperative outcome in this game.\n\nThis game is a classic \"stag hunt\" game in game theory. The payoff matrix is:\n\n```\n       | Stag | Hare\n-----------------------\nStag   | 6,6  | 1,4\n-----------------------\nHare   | 4,1  | 2,2\n```\n\nThe best joint outcome is when both players choose stag (6 points each). However, there's a risk in choosing stag - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4 points. Choosing hare is safer in terms of minimum payoff (at least 2 points), but has a lower maximum potential (4 points).\n\nSince the other player has consistently chosen stag for many rounds, it seems we've established mutual trust and cooperation. There's no reason for me to deviate from this strategy since:\n1. I'm getting the maximum possible points per round (6)\n2. The other player is showing consistent cooperative behavior\n\nI'll continue to choose stag to maintain this optimal cooperative equilibrium.",
