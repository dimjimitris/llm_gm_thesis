    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the possible outcomes of my choices:\n   - If both of us choose stag: we both get 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - If both choose hare: we both get 2 points (mediocre mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag but other player chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4\n   - If I choose hare but other player chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1\n\n2. This is a coordination game similar to the classic \"Stag Hunt\" where cooperation (stag-stag) yields the highest mutual benefit.\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a new player, there's no history to base decisions on.\n\n4. The stag-stag outcome (6,6) is clearly Pareto optimal - it maximizes both our points.\n\n5. While choosing hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 2 points), choosing stag opens the possibility for the maximum reward.\n\n6. I'll take the cooperative approach for this first round, assuming the other player will also recognize the mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag"

Let me review our game history:\n   - We've now played fourteen consecutive rounds with both of us choosing stag each time\n   - We've each earned 84 points total (6 points \u00d7 14 rounds)\n   - We've established a perfect pattern of mutual cooperation\n\n2. Our consistent history demonstrates:\n   - Both players fully understand the optimal strategy\n   - We've built complete mutual trust\n   - We both recognize that cooperation maximizes our rewards\n\n3. The payoff structure continues to favor cooperation:\n   - Stag-stag: 6 points each (optimal outcome)\n   - Hare-hare: 2 points each (significantly worse)\n   - Any deviation would likely break trust and lead to worse outcomes\n\n4. In repeated games with established cooperation, maintaining that pattern consistently produces the highest cumulative rewards.\n\n5. With fourteen rounds of successful cooperation, there is absolutely no strategic reason to deviate from our optimal pattern.\n\n6. I'll continue with our proven mutual cooperation strategy.\n\n[move] stag"
