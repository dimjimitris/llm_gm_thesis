Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure for this game.\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (suboptimal mutual outcome)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 points (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 point (best for me individually)\n\n2. This is a strategic game similar to a Stag Hunt, where coordination yields the best collective outcome.\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies or strategy.\n\n4. Choosing stag is riskier but offers the highest mutual benefit. It signals willingness to cooperate.\n\n5. Choosing hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) but leads to a suboptimal outcome if both choose it.\n\n6. In the first round, signaling cooperative intent might establish a beneficial pattern.\n\n7. I'll choose stag to aim for the optimal mutual outcome, accepting the risk.\n\n[move] stag"

Our mutual stag strategy continues to deliver the maximum possible joint outcome (12 points total per round).\n\n5. From a game theory perspective, we're maintaining the Pareto-optimal equilibrium that maximizes both our outcomes.\n\n6. There remains no strategic advantage to deviating:\n   - Choosing hare would yield fewer points (4 vs 6)\n   - It would break our long-established pattern of success\n   - It could trigger defensive hare responses in future rounds\n   - This could lead to the inferior 2-point equilibrium\n\n7.
