You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

I got 1 point.\n   - Round 2: I chose hare, opponent chose stag. I got 4 points.\n   - Round 3: I chose stag, opponent chose hare. I got 1 point.\n   - Round 4: I chose hare, opponent chose stag. I got 4 points.\n   - Round 5-15: Pattern continues perfectly - opponent always chooses hare in odd rounds, stag in even rounds.\n\n2. My opponent has maintained a perfect pattern throughout the entire game:\n   - Odd rounds (1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15): They always choose hare\n   - Even rounds (2,4,6,8,10,12,14): They always choose stag\n\n3. The upcoming round is round 16, which is even.\n\n4. Based on the opponent's 100% consistent pattern over 15 rounds, they will almost certainly choose stag this round.\n\n5. If I choose stag when they choose stag, we both get 6 points (optimal outcome).\n\n6. If I choose hare when they choose stag, I get 4 points and they get 1.\n\n7.
