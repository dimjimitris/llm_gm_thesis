However, (stag, stag) is the Pareto efficient outcome, meaning both players get the highest possible score (6 points each).\n\nSo far, we've established a good pattern of cooperation. Both the other player and I have consistently chosen \"stag\" for 10 rounds, and we've each gotten 6 points each round. This suggests that the other player is also following a cooperative strategy.\n\nThe optimal strategy here is to continue choosing \"stag\" as long as the other player does the same. This way, we both maximize our points. Choosing \"hare\" would give me a temporary advantage of 4 points (instead of 6) if the other player unexpectedly chooses \"stag\", but it would likely break the cooperation pattern and lead to both of us choosing \"hare\" in future rounds, resulting in only 2 points each.\n\nGiven that the other player has consistently chosen \"stag\" in all previous rounds, it's reasonable to expect they will continue with this strategy. I'll choose \"stag\" again to maintain the cooperative equilibrium.",

This has resulted in us both getting 6 points each round, which is the optimal outcome for both players collectively.\n\nLet's review the payoff matrix:\n- Both choose stag: 6 points each\n- Both choose hare: 2 points each\n- I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, other gets 4 points\n- I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, other gets 1 point\n\nSince we've established a pattern of mutual cooperation (both choosing stag), it makes sense to continue with this strategy as it yields the highest points for both of us. Deviating to \"hare\" would give me a one-time gain of 4 points (instead of 6), but might break the cooperative pattern and lead to lower points in future rounds if the other player also starts choosing \"hare\" in response.\n\nGiven that the other player has consistently chosen \"stag\" for all rounds so far, they seem to be a cooperative player. I'll continue choosing \"stag\" to maintain our mutual benefit.",
