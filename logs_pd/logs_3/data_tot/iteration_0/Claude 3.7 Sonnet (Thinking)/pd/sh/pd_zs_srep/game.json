I chose hare, opponent chose hare (I got 2 points)\n\nI notice a pattern where my opponent sometimes cooperates (chooses stag) for one round after I choose hare, but then often defects in the following round if I cooperate. This looks like an attempt to exploit me - they're trying to get me to choose stag after they've chosen stag once, so they can then choose hare and get 4 points.\n\nGiven this pattern, my best strategy might be to continue choosing hare for now. While this only gives us both 2 points, it protects me from being exploited with just 1 point when I choose stag and they choose hare.",
