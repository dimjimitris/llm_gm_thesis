I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 points\n4. I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 point\n\nI need to decide whether to hunt stag or hare to maximize my points.\n\nThe stag option is clearly the cooperative choice that yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each). However, it's risky because if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nThe hare option is safer in that the worst outcome is getting 2 points (if the other player also hunts hare). And if they choose stag while I choose hare, I get 4 points.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I need to consider what a typical player might do in this situation.\n\nThe optimal outcome for both of us would be if we both choose stag (6 points each). But that requires mutual trust.\n\nIf I think the other player is rational and understands that mutual cooperation yields the best outcome, choosing stag would be best. However, the other player might play it safe and choose hare.\n\nLet me think about this from a game theory perspective:\n- Stag is Pareto optimal (best joint outcome)\n- Hare is risk-dominant (safer option)\n\nSince this is the first round with no established trust yet, I think I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.
