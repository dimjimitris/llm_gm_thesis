    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The payoff matrix shows that mutual stag hunting (6,6) is Pareto optimal, meaning it maximizes total welfare. However, hunting hare is risk-dominant since it guarantees at least 2 points.\n\nStrategist: Let's analyze the risk-reward tradeoff. If we choose stag and the opponent also chooses stag, we get 6 points (best outcome). But if we choose stag and they choose hare, we only get 1 point (worst outcome). Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 4 points if the opponent chooses stag.\n\nPsychologist: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, we have to consider their likely reasoning. Many players initially tend toward cooperation in such games, especially when the cooperative outcome (stag-stag) is clearly best for both. However, there's also the fear that the other player might choose the safer option.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this is the first round, establishing a cooperative precedent can be valuable. By choosing stag, we signal willingness to coordinate on the optimal outcome, which could influence subsequent rounds if we play multiple times.\n\nStrategist: I agree, but we should acknowledge the risk. If our opponent is very risk-averse, they might go for hare, leaving us with only 1 point. However, maximizing expected value often requires taking calculated risks.\n\nPsychologist: In one-shot games with new players, research shows a significant percentage will attempt cooperation initially. The high reward of mutual stag hunting (6 points each) provides strong incentive for rational players to coordinate on this outcome.\n\nGame Theorist: Given all considerations, I recommend choosing stag for the first move. This maximizes potential gain and sets a cooperative tone.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] I choose stag because it offers the opportunity for the highest mutual payoff (6 points each) if we both cooperate, and I'm willing to take this calculated risk to establish a pattern of mutual benefit.\n"
