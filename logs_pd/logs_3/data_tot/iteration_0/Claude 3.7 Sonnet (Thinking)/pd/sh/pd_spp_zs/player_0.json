    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

First, let me identify helpful personas for this collaboration:\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Strategic Thinker, Psychologist, Decision Analyst\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic Stag Hunt game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The (stag, stag) outcome is Pareto efficient, yielding the highest joint payoff (12 points total), but requires mutual trust. The (hare, hare) outcome is risk-dominant, as it minimizes the potential loss from coordination failure.\n\nStrategic Thinker: For the first move, we're facing a fresh player with no history. We need to balance risk and reward. Choosing \"stag\" has the highest potential payoff (6 points) but carries the risk of exploitation (1 point if opponent chooses hare).\n\nPsychologist: Most players tend to start with cooperative moves in repeated games to establish trust. Without prior history, there's a reasonable chance the opponent will choose \"stag\" to maximize potential mutual benefit.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's calculate expected values. If we assign a 60% probability the opponent chooses stag and 40% they choose hare:\n- Choosing stag: 0.6(6) + 0.4(1) = 3.6 + 0.4 = 4.0 points expected\n- Choosing hare: 0.6(4) + 0.4(2) = 2.4 + 0.8 = 3.2 points expected\n\nStrategic Thinker: Based on this analysis, choosing \"stag\" offers both the highest potential reward and highest expected value, though with more variance.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I'll choose cooperation for potential mutual benefit."

This is significant as it suggests our opponent is willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Since both players chose stag in the first round, we've established a cooperative precedent. The rational choice is to maintain this coordination by choosing stag again. Deviating to hare would give us a one-time gain (4 points vs 6 points) but likely break trust.\n\nPsychologist: People tend to continue successful patterns. Our opponent has demonstrated cooperative intent, so they're likely to choose stag again unless they're specifically trying to exploit a pattern. The first-round cooperation has created positive expectations.\n\nDecision Analyst: With the history of successful cooperation:\n- If we choose stag and opponent chooses stag again: 6 points\n- If we choose stag and opponent defects to hare: 1 point\n- If we choose hare and opponent stays with stag: 4 points\n- If we choose hare and opponent also switches to hare: 2 points\n\nThe expected value calculation now should weigh more heavily toward the opponent choosing stag again, perhaps 80% probability. This makes choosing stag even more favorable.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I recommend maintaining stag to reinforce the cooperative equilibrium we've established.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Continuing with cooperation based on our successful first round."

We've established a mutually beneficial equilibrium, and there's no reason to deviate.

People generally maintain successful strategies unless they have reason to change.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given our history:\n- We've earned 12 points in 2 rounds through consistent cooperation (6 points per round)\n- Switching to hare would yield at most 4 points in this round if the opponent still chooses stag\n- This short-term gain would likely lead to worse outcomes in future rounds if the opponent responds by also choosing hare (dropping to 2 points per round)\n- The expected long-term value clearly favors continuing with stag\n\nStrategic Thinker: I strongly recommend maintaining our stag strategy.
