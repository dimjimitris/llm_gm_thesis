      "reasoning_text": "I'm playing a stag hunt game with another player. Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n\n- If both choose stag: Both get 6 points (best cooperative outcome)\n- If both choose hare: Both get 2 points (suboptimal but safe)\n- If one chooses stag and one chooses hare:\n  - Stag chooser gets 1 point (worst outcome)\n  - Hare chooser gets 4 points (exploitation)\n\nThis is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: both choosing stag or both choosing hare. The stag equilibrium is payoff-dominant (highest possible reward) but risky, while the hare equilibrium is risk-dominant (safer option).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I need to consider what strategy maximizes my expected payoff given uncertainty about their choice.\n\nLet me analyze the expected values:\n- If I choose stag: I get 6 points if they choose stag, 1 point if they choose hare\n- If I choose hare: I get 4 points if they choose stag, 2 points if they choose hare\n\nIf I think there's a probability p that they'll choose stag, then:\n- Expected value of choosing stag = 6p + 1(1-p) = 6p + 1 - p = 5p + 1\n- Expected value of choosing hare = 4p + 2(1-p) = 4p + 2 - 2p = 2p + 2\n\nSetting these equal: 5p + 1 = 2p + 2\n3p = 1\np = 1/3\n\nSo if I believe there's more than a 1/3 chance they'll choose stag, I should choose stag. If I believe there's less than a 1/3 chance, I should choose hare.\n\nSince I have no information about my opponent, I might assume they're also reasoning similarly. The stag strategy has higher potential payoff, but it's riskier. In the absence of communication or coordination, many players would choose the safer option (hare).\n\nHowever, I also want to encourage cooperative play if possible. I think I'll choose stag as my opening move, hoping for the cooperative equilibrium, but I'll be prepared to adjust if my opponent chooses hare.",

If we both play stag, we both get 6 points, which is the highest mutual benefit. If I were to switch to hare while they play stag, I would get 4 points instead of 6, which is worse for me. The only scenario where playing hare would be better is if I expected the opponent to play hare, but given their long history of playing stag, that seems unlikely.\n\nSo I'll continue with stag.",

I got 4 points, they got 1.\nRound 3-14: We both chose stag each time. We each got 6 points per round.\n\nThis shows that after the first two rounds where we both tried to take advantage of each other, we settled into a stable cooperative pattern of both choosing stag, which gives the maximum total points (12 points distributed as 6 each).\n\nThis is the optimal strategy when both players are focused on maximizing their long-term gains. The pattern has been stable for 12 consecutive rounds now, suggesting my opponent understands the benefit of cooperation.\n\nBased on this history, the best move is to continue choosing stag, as there's no indication my opponent is likely to defect at this point, and we're both getting the maximum possible individual points (6) each round.",
