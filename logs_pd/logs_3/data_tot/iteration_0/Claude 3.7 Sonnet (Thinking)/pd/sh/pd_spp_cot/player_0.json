    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me think through this with some helpful personas.\n\nPersonas: Game Theory Expert, Risk Analyst, Behavioral Psychologist, Strategic Planner\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is the classic Stag Hunt game from game theory. There are two Nash equilibria: both players choosing stag (pareto optimal) or both players choosing hare (risk-dominant). The stag-stag outcome yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each), but requires mutual trust.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the risk. Choosing stag has higher potential reward (6 points) but higher risk - if the other player chooses hare, you only get 1 point while they get 4. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4 points, minimizing your downside.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first round with a fresh player, they haven't formed expectations yet. Many players start cooperatively and choose stag in hopes of establishing mutual cooperation. However, some may play conservatively with hare to minimize risk.\n\nStrategic Planner: For the first move, I recommend choosing stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. This establishes a cooperative precedent that could lead to the optimal outcome. If they choose hare instead, we can reassess in future rounds.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. The stag-stag equilibrium is payoff-dominant. And since this is a repeated game, choosing stag initially can help establish cooperation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing stag to aim for mutual cooperation and the highest possible payoff."

This suggests the other player is rational and willing to cooperate. In repeated games, maintaining the pareto-optimal equilibrium (stag-stag) is often sustainable once established.\n\nRisk Analyst: The first round succeeded with mutual cooperation. The risk profile has improved since we now have evidence the other player is willing to choose stag. The expected value of continuing with stag remains higher than switching to hare.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The other player's choice of stag signals cooperative intent. Players typically continue with successful strategies unless given reason to change. Since the first round produced the best possible outcome for both, there's strong incentive to maintain this pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend continuing with stag. We've established mutual cooperation which benefits both players maximally. Deviating to hare would provide a one-time gain of 4 points (versus 6) but would likely break trust and lead to lower payoffs in future rounds if the other player retaliates by choosing hare in subsequent rounds.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Agreed. Maintaining the stag-stag equilibrium is optimal as long as there's no reason to believe the other player will defect.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag We established successful cooperation in the first round, so I'll continue with stag to maintain our mutually beneficial arrangement."

The probability that the other player will defect has decreased further based on their consistent behavior. The expected value of continuing with stag remains significantly higher than switching to hare.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Two rounds of consistent cooperation indicates strong mutual trust. Players typically maintain successful strategies in iterated games unless there's a strategic reason to change.
