My opponent has defected 6 times out of 6 rounds - 100% consistency\n2. We're in a stable but suboptimal Nash equilibrium \n3. The question is whether I should try to break this pattern\n\nThe key insight here is that we're both losing out on potential gains. If we could both cooperate, we'd each get 4 points instead of 2. But the risk is that if I cooperate and they continue defecting, I get only 1 point while they get 6.\n\nHowever, I'm wondering if at some point it might be worth trying cooperation to see if we can establish a new pattern. The opponent might be thinking the same thing - that we're both stuck in a suboptimal outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, the opponent has shown complete consistency. There's no sign they want to change. After 6 rounds, this is a very established pattern.\n\nBut maybe this is exactly when I should try something different? If the game continues indefinitely with mutual defection, we'll both keep getting suboptimal outcomes forever.\n\nLet me think about the risks:\n- If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1, they get 6 (bad for me)\n- If I cooperate and they also cooperate: I get 4, they get 4 (good for both)\n- If I defect and they cooperate: I get 6, they get 1 (best for me)\n- If I defect and they defect: I get 2, they get 2 (current situation)\n\nThe question is: what's the probability they might also try cooperation after 6 rounds of mutual defection?\n\nGiven their complete consistency, it seems very low. But maybe they're also getting tired of the suboptimal outcome.\n\nI think I should stick with defection. \n\nThe potential for catastrophic loss is simply too great.
