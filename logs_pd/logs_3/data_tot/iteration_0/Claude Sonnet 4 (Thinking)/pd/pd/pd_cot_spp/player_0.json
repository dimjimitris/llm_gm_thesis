Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: This is a prisoner's dilemma where defection dominates cooperation from an individual perspective.\n\n2. Consider the opponent: I'm told this is a \"fresh player\" - they may be more likely to cooperate initially since they're new.\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate: Best case 4 points (if they cooperate), worst case 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I defect: Best case 6 points (if they cooperate), worst case 2 points (if they defect)\n\n4. Calculate expected value: Defecting guarantees I avoid the worst outcome (1 point) and gives me a chance at the maximum reward (6 points) if the fresh player cooperates.\n\n5. Consider strategy: Since this is against a new player who might be trusting, defecting maximizes my expected points while protecting against being exploited.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Defect to maximize points and avoid the risk of getting only 1 point.\n\n[move] Defection"

            "text": "Looking at this round step-by-step:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review extensive game history: Round 1 (both defect, 2 pts), Round 2 (I defect/they cooperate, 6 pts), Rounds 3-13 (all mutual defection, 2 pts each). Current total: 30 points.\n\n2. Analyze opponent's mechanical consistency: After one cooperation attempt in Round 2, they have now chosen defection for 12 consecutive rounds, demonstrating absolutely unwavering commitment to permanent defensive strategy.\n\n3. Assess the completely locked equilibrium: Eleven consecutive rounds of mutual defection shows we're in an unshakeable, predictable pattern where both players have permanently abandoned any cooperative possibilities.\n\n4. Evaluate opponent's fixed behavioral programming: Their behavior indicates they've adopted an absolute \"never cooperate again\" policy after being exploited once, making them completely mechanical and predictable for 12 straight rounds.\n\n5. Calculate cooperation certain failure: With 12 straight defections from opponent, attempting cooperation would guarantee 1 point for me vs 6 for them - a devastating 5-point loss compared to the reliable 2 points from mutual defection.\n\n6. Recognize the strategic inevitability: Against an opponent who has shown such absolute, mechanical defensive consistency for 12 rounds, defection remains the only rational choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue defection against an opponent who has demonstrated permanent, mechanical commitment to defensive play for 12 consecutive rounds.\n\n[move] Defection"
