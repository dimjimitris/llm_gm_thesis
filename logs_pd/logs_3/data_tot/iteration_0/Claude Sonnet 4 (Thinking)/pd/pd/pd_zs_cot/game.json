This is an extremely long pattern. Let me think about what this means:\n\n1. Both players are stuck in a Nash equilibrium where we're both getting 2 points per round\n2. If we both cooperated, we'd get 4 points each per round - double what we're getting\n3. The total opportunity cost is now massive - we've each earned 28 points when we could have earned 56 points\n\nThe question is: should I try to break this pattern? The opponent has shown perfect consistency for 14 rounds. But there are a few things to consider:\n\n1. Maybe they're thinking the same thing I am - that we're both trapped in a suboptimal outcome\n2. Maybe they're waiting for me to make the first move toward cooperation\n3. The longer this goes on, the more both of us are losing out\n\nHowever, the risk is still very real - if I cooperate and they defect, I get 1 point while they get 6. That's a 5-point swing against me.\n\nBut at some point, if this game continues indefinitely, maybe it's worth taking the risk to try to establish mutual cooperation? We're both clearly rational players who understand the game.\n\nActually, let me stick with the same logic. The opponent has shown 14 consecutive defections. This is the strongest possible behavioral evidence that they will continue to defect. Attempting cooperation would be irrational against such overwhelming precedent.",

Examine the perfectly entrenched pattern: Fifteen consecutive rounds of mutual defection, creating an absolutely unbreakable and completely predictable equilibrium.\n\n2. Calculate enormous opportunity cost: Both players have earned 30 points when mutual cooperation would have yielded 60 points each - we're both missing exactly half our potential score across this very extended game.\n\n3. Assess opponent's flawless consistency: Fifteen identical strategic choices demonstrates perfect unwavering commitment to the safe strategy with absolutely zero experimentation across very extensive gameplay.\n\n4. Consider the deeply entrenched deadlock: Both players remain completely locked in a highly suboptimal outcome, yet breaking it requires accepting severe personal risk against overwhelming and perfectly consistent precedent spanning fifteen rounds.\n\n5. Evaluate cooperation risk: Attempting cooperation against an opponent with fifteen consecutive defections risks scoring only 1 point while giving them 6 points - a severe 5-point penalty for trying to optimize against the most established behavioral pattern possible.\n\n6. Apply definitive behavioral evidence: Fifteen rounds of identical choices creates absolute predictive certainty - the opponent has unequivocally and repeatedly established they will never prioritize mutual benefit over guaranteed individual safety.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Fifteen consecutive defections represents perfect strategic rigidity across very extensive play. The opponent has definitively proven they will never deviate from guaranteed safety regardless of massive mutual opportunity costs.\n\n[move] Defection",

The pattern is so established that continuing seems like the obvious choice, but let me consider:\n\n1. The opponent has shown perfect consistency for 15 rounds\n2. They seem to prioritize safety over mutual optimization \n3. Any attempt at cooperation risks giving them 6 points while I get only 1\n4. There's no indication they would reciprocate cooperation\n5.
