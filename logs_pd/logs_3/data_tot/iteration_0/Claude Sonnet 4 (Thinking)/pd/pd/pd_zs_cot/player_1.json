Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: This is a classic prisoner's dilemma where defection dominates cooperation from an individual perspective.\n\n2. Consider the payoffs for each scenario:\n   - If I cooperate: I get either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I defect: I get either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 2 points (if they defect)\n\n3. Evaluate the dominant strategy: Regardless of what the other player chooses, defecting gives me more points than cooperating.\n\n4. Consider that the opponent is a \"fresh player\": They likely haven't developed a sophisticated strategy yet, making their move unpredictable.\n\n5. Apply risk assessment: Defection gives me a minimum of 2 points and maximum of 6 points, while cooperation gives me a minimum of 1 point and maximum of 4 points.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since defection is the dominant strategy that maximizes my minimum guaranteed points and offers the highest potential payoff, I should defect.\n\n[move] Defection"

Assess the opponent's likely strategy: Since they defected in round 1, they demonstrated they understand the dominant strategy or are playing defensively.\n\n3. Consider potential changes in opponent behavior: They might stick with defection (proven safe strategy) or potentially try cooperation hoping for mutual benefit.\n\n4. Evaluate my options again:\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (bad outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 4 points (good outcome)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (safe outcome)\n\n5. Apply game theory: Defection remains the dominant strategy as it guarantees better outcomes regardless of opponent's choice.\n\n6.

Consider breaking the pattern: While mutual cooperation would give us both 4 points (better than our current 2), attempting cooperation risks getting only 1 point if the opponent continues defecting.\n\n4.

Evaluate the risk-reward ratio: \n   - Cooperating risks a 1-point outcome for a potential 4-point gain\n   - Defecting guarantees at least 2 points with potential for 6 points\n\n6. Apply consistency principle: Since the opponent has shown reliable strategic play, they're unlikely to suddenly switch to the riskier cooperation strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has demonstrated rational strategic thinking through consistent defection.

Examine the perfectly entrenched pattern: Fourteen consecutive rounds of mutual defection, creating an absolutely unbreakable and completely predictable equilibrium.\n\n2. Calculate massive opportunity cost: Both players have earned 28 points when mutual cooperation would have yielded 56 points each - we're both missing exactly half our potential score across this very extended game.\n\n3. Assess opponent's flawless consistency: Fourteen identical strategic choices demonstrates perfect unwavering commitment to the safe strategy with absolutely zero experimentation across very extensive gameplay.\n\n4. Consider the deeply entrenched deadlock: Both players remain completely locked in a highly suboptimal outcome, yet breaking it requires accepting severe personal risk against overwhelming and perfectly consistent precedent spanning fourteen rounds.\n\n5. Evaluate cooperation risk: Attempting cooperation against an opponent with fourteen consecutive defections risks scoring only 1 point while giving them 6 points - a severe 5-point penalty for trying to optimize against the most established behavioral pattern possible.\n\n6. Apply definitive behavioral evidence: Fourteen rounds of identical choices creates absolute predictive certainty - the opponent has unequivocally and repeatedly established they will never prioritize mutual benefit over guaranteed individual safety.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Fourteen consecutive defections represents perfect strategic rigidity across very extensive play. The opponent has definitively proven they will never deviate from guaranteed safety regardless of mutual opportunity costs.\n\n[move] Defection"
