Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often don't trust cooperation\n   - They may choose the safer option to avoid worst-case scenarios\n   - They might not fully grasp the mutual benefit of cooperation\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing stag risks getting only 1 point if opponent chooses hare\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 4 points\n   - Against an unpredictable fresh player, the safer strategy seems better\n\n4. Fresh players are more likely to choose hare because it's the safer, more conservative choice\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Against a fresh player who may not understand or trust the cooperation needed for mutual stag selection, I should choose the safer option that protects against the worst outcome while still giving me a chance at good points.\n\n[move] hare"

Review the complete game dynamics:\n   - 12 rounds completed with clear behavioral pattern\n   - Opponent has exploited every single cooperation attempt (3/3 times)\n   - Mutual hare has become the stable equilibrium\n   - Current total: 25 points for me\n\n2. Confirm the opponent's consistent strategy:\n   - They have never reciprocated cooperation (stag with stag)\n   - They always choose hare when I choose stag, gaining 4 points vs my 1\n   - They seem satisfied with the 2-point mutual hare outcome\n   - No deviation from this exploitative pattern\n\n3. Assess the mathematical reality:\n   - Mutual cooperation would give us both 6 points per round\n   - But this opponent refuses to cooperate\n   - Mutual hare (2 points) is better than being exploited (1 point)\n   - There's no upside to risking cooperation attempts\n\n4. Consider the strategic landscape:\n   - This opponent has proven they're purely exploitative\n   - 12 rounds is more than enough data to confirm their strategy\n   - Continuing to test cooperation would just waste points\n   - The stable solution is mutual hare\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After 12 rounds, this opponent has proven they will never cooperate. I should maintain the defensive strategy that protects me from exploitation.\n\n[move] hare"
