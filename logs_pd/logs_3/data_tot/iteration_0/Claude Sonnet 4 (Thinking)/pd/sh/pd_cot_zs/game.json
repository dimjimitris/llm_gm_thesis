Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often don't trust cooperation\n   - They may choose the safer option to avoid worst-case scenarios\n   - They might not fully grasp the mutual benefit of cooperation\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing stag risks getting only 1 point if opponent chooses hare\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, with potential for 4 points\n   - Against an unpredictable fresh player, the safer strategy seems better\n\n4. Fresh players are more likely to choose hare because it's the safer, more conservative choice\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Against a fresh player who may not understand or trust the cooperation needed for mutual stag selection, I should choose the safer option that protects against the worst outcome while still giving me a chance at good points.\n\n[move] hare"

The best mutual outcome is if we both choose stag (6,6)\n2. The worst outcome for me is if I choose stag and they choose hare (1,4)\n3. If I choose hare, I'm guaranteed at least 2 points regardless of what they do\n4. If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get the second-best individual outcome (4 points)\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (meaning they're new), I need to consider what they might do:\n- A fresh player might not understand the cooperation aspect and might go for the safer hare option\n- Or they might not think strategically and just pick randomly\n- Or they might be risk-averse and choose hare to avoid the worst outcome\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player, I think there's a higher chance they'll choose hare because:\n1. It's the safer option (guaranteed 2+ points)\n2. New players often don't trust cooperation in games\n3. They might not fully understand the mutual benefit of both choosing stag\n\nIf I assume they're likely to choose hare, then I should choose hare too to get 2 points rather than risk getting only 1 point.\n\nHowever, let me also consider: if I want to maximize my expected payoff and I think there's some chance they might choose stag, then:\n\n\nChoosing hare provides a strategic advantage against an unpredictable opponent.

Recognize the destructive pattern:\n   - We're locked in a cycle where cooperation attempts get punished\n   - Each player exploits the other when they try to cooperate\n   - This prevents us from reaching the optimal mutual stag outcome (6 points each)\n   - Current total: 16 points for me\n\n3. Evaluate the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They just punished my cooperation attempt again\n   - They might expect me to return to defensive hare\n   - They're probably as frustrated with this cycle as I am\n   - Both of us are missing out on better outcomes\n\n4. Consider how to break this cycle:\n   - Continuing with hare keeps us in suboptimal 2-point outcomes\n   - Someone needs to show consistent good faith to establish trust\n   - The risk is getting exploited again, but the reward is much higher\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: This destructive cycle is preventing us both from achieving better outcomes.

Every time I try to cooperate (choose stag), they punish me with hare. And every time they try to cooperate (choose stag), I've been punishing them with hare (except in round 7 where I chose stag and they chose hare).\n\nThis is a destructive cycle where neither of us can establish trust. The opponent might be thinking I'm untrustworthy because I keep exploiting their cooperation attempts.\n\nWhat should I do?\n- If I choose hare, and they choose hare, we both get 2 (safe)\n- If I choose hare, and they choose stag, I get 4 (exploiting them again)\n- If I choose stag, and they choose hare, I get 1 (being exploited again)\n\n\n- If I choose stag, and they choose stag, we both get 6 (optimal)\n\nBreaking the cycle requires a leap of faith. Despite past betrayals, mutual cooperation offers the highest potential reward. I'm leaning towards choosing stag, hoping the opponent recognizes the opportunity for a more productive strategy.

Analyze the current moment:\n   - We're back to the \"safe\" mutual hare equilibrium\n   - Both players are being defensive after the exploitation cycle\n   - Someone needs to break this pattern to unlock better outcomes\n   - The opponent might be thinking the same thing\n\n4. Consider the strategic necessity:\n   - We're both losing 4 potential points per round (6 vs 2)\n   - This mutual defensive stance is hurting both of us\n   - Taking a risk on cooperation might be necessary\n   - If they're rational, they should want the better outcome too\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: We're both stuck in a suboptimal pattern.

We need to somehow signal that we want to cooperate rather than exploit. The challenge is that both of us have shown we'll exploit cooperation attempts.\n\nMaybe I should try stag again to show I'm serious about cooperation, even though I got burned twice already. Or maybe I should stick with hare since we're both being defensive.\n\nThe key insight is that we're both losing out on the optimal outcome (6 points each with mutual stag) because we can't trust each other.

Confirm the opponent's completely predictable strategy:\n   - Zero cooperation attempts across 15 rounds\n   - 100% exploitation when I show any trust\n   - Consistently content with 2-point mutual outcomes\n   - No strategic evolution whatsoever\n\n3. Assess the absolute certainty:\n   - 15 rounds provides overwhelming evidence of non-cooperative behavior\n   - This opponent will never choose mutual cooperation\n   - Any stag choice guarantees exploitation (1 point vs their 4)\n   - Mutual hare is definitively the optimal achievable outcome\n\n4. Recognize the strategic reality:\n   - No possibility of behavioral change after 15 rounds\n   - Cooperation attempts are guaranteed losses\n   - Defensive play is the only sensible strategy\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After 15 rounds of absolutely consistent exploitative behavior, this opponent will never cooperate.
