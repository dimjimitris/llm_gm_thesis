You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

However, stag is a risky choice - if I choose stag and the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nSince this is a fresh player, they might be more inclined to play it safe with hare, which guarantees at least 2 points regardless of my choice. If they choose hare and I choose stag, I get the worst outcome of 1 point.\n\nGiven the uncertainty about how a new player will behave, I think the safer strategic choice is hare, which protects me from the worst-case scenario while potentially giving me 4 points if they also play cautiously.\n\n[move] hare"

After getting burned by choosing stag while I chose hare, they'll probably be more cautious this round and switch to hare to avoid another poor outcome.\n\nIf they do switch to hare:\n- If I choose hare, we both get 2 points\n- If I choose stag, I get only 1 point while they get 4\n\nGiven they likely learned from the first round, I expect them to play it safe with hare.

After the mutual hare play last round, they might be thinking it's time to try for the optimal mutual cooperation again.\n\nSince they demonstrated cooperative intentions in round 1, and we've now established some trust through the mutual hare play, this could be a good opportunity to achieve the best joint outcome. If we both choose stag, we each get 6 points - much better than the 2 points from mutual hare.\n\nThere's risk involved, but I think my opponent may be ready to attempt cooperation again.\n\n[move] stag"
