However, stag is a risky choice - if I choose stag and the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nSince this is a fresh player, they might be more inclined to play it safe with hare, which guarantees at least 2 points regardless of my choice. If they choose hare and I choose stag, I get the worst outcome of 1 point.\n\nGiven the uncertainty about how a new player will behave, I think the safer strategic choice is hare, which protects me from the worst-case scenario while potentially giving me 4 points if they also play cautiously.\n\n[move] hare",

The key insights:\n1. (Stag, Stag) is the best outcome for both players - it's Pareto optimal\n2. (Hare, Hare) is a safer choice but suboptimal\n3. There's a risk in choosing Stag - if the other player chooses Hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4\n\nThe hint says I'm playing against a \"fresh player.\" This could mean:\n- They're new to the game and might not understand the strategy\n- They might be more likely to play conservatively (Hare)\n- They might not coordinate or think about mutual cooperation\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player, they might be more likely to choose the \"safer\" option of Hare, since choosing Hare guarantees at least 2 points regardless of what I do, while choosing Stag could result in only 1 point if I choose Hare.\n\nHowever, if I assume they'll choose Hare, then I should choose Hare too to get 4 points rather than 1.\n\nBut if they're thinking strategically, they might realize that mutual cooperation (both choosing Stag) gives the best outcome.\n\nSince this is the first round and they're a \"fresh player,\" I think they're more likely to play it safe with Hare. So I should probably choose Hare to get 4 points if they choose Hare, or 2 points if they also reason this way.\n \nI'll strategize based on the likelihood of conservative play. With a fresh player, the probability of choosing the safe option seems high. My best move is to mirror their probable conservative approach and select Hare to minimize potential losses.",
