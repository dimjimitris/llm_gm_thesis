Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix - mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint benefit of 6 points each.\n\n2. Consider the risk factors - choosing stag is high-risk/high-reward (6 if other cooperates, 1 if they defect), while hare is more consistent (4 against stag, 2 against hare).\n\n3. Evaluate opponent behavior - since this is a \"fresh player,\" they may not immediately recognize the cooperative strategy and might choose the seemingly safer hare option.\n\n4. Calculate expected outcomes - if the fresh player is likely to choose hare, then my stag choice would only net 1 point, while my hare choice would net 4 points.\n\n5. Balance risk vs reward - while mutual stag cooperation would be ideal, the risk of getting only 1 point against a potentially cautious fresh player is significant.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given the uncertainty with a fresh player who may choose the \"safer\" hare option, I'll choose hare to avoid the worst-case scenario while still having a chance at decent points.\n\n[move] hare"

Both players chose hare in round 1, showing we both played cautiously initially - this suggests the other player is also thinking strategically.\n\n2. Since we both got the same modest reward (2 points), the other player now knows I also chose the \"safe\" option, which might build some trust.\n\n3. The fresh player may now recognize that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) would give us both 6 points instead of 2 - a significant improvement.\n\n4. Having established that we both think similarly (both chose hare), there's a higher probability they might be willing to try the cooperative stag option this round.\n\n5. The risk is still present - if they stick with hare while I choose stag, I get only 1 point. But the potential reward of mutual cooperation (6 points) is substantial.\n\n6. Since this is a fresh player who showed strategic thinking in round 1, they may be ready to attempt the high-reward cooperative strategy now.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on the mutual caution shown in round 1, I believe there's a good chance this player will recognize the opportunity for mutual benefit.
