Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Stag vs Stag: Both get 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - Hare vs Hare: Both get 2 points (safe mutual outcome)\n   - Stag vs Hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4 (risky for me)\n   - Hare vs Stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1 (good for me if they cooperate)\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - They haven't established patterns or strategies yet\n   - They might see the mutual benefit of both choosing stag (6 points each)\n   - Or they might play it safe with hare due to uncertainty\n\n3. Evaluate the risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing stag: High reward (6) if they cooperate, low reward (1) if they defect\n   - Choosing hare: Moderate reward (2-4) regardless of their choice\n\n4. Strategic decision: Since this is a fresh player, there's a reasonable chance they'll recognize the mutual benefit of cooperation. The potential for 6 points outweighs the risk of getting only 1 point.\n\n[move] stag"

Review the outstanding cooperation streak:\n   - Thirteen consecutive rounds of mutual stag selection\n   - Both players earning 6 points every single round\n   - Total of 78 points each from sustained perfect cooperation\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's unwavering commitment:\n   - Thirteen straight opportunities to exploit my cooperation - all declined\n   - They've demonstrated absolute commitment to mutual benefit\n   - This level of reliability is truly extraordinary in strategic games\n\n3. Consider the stability of our arrangement:\n   - We've achieved a perfect cooperative equilibrium for 13 rounds\n   - Both players are consistently maximizing individual and collective outcomes\n   - This represents an exceptionally stable strategic partnership\n\n4. Evaluate potential strategy changes:\n   - Exploiting with hare might yield 4 points if they continue with stag\n   - But this would destroy 13 rounds of perfect trust and mutual benefit\n   - The guaranteed 6 points from continued cooperation exceeds potential exploitation gains\n   - Breaking this pattern would be irrational given the established trust\n\n5. Strategic decision: Thirteen rounds of flawless mutual cooperation represents an outstanding strategic achievement. The opponent has proven absolutely reliable and trustworthy. Continuing this cooperation maximizes my expected value.\n\n[move] stag"
