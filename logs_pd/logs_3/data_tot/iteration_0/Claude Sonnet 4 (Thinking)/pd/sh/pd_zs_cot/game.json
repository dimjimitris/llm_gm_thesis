Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - They haven't established patterns or strategies yet\n   - They might see the mutual benefit of both choosing stag (6 points each)\n   - Or they might play it safe with hare due to uncertainty\n\n3. Evaluate the risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing stag: High reward (6) if they cooperate, low reward (1) if they defect\n   - Choosing hare: Moderate reward (2-4) regardless of their choice\n\n4.

Identify the best mutual outcome: Both choosing stag gives us both 6 points, which is the highest individual score possible.\n\n2. Identify the risk: If I choose stag but the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\n3. Identify the safe option: Choosing hare guarantees me at least 2 points (if they also choose hare) or 4 points (if they choose stag).\n\n4. Consider what a \"fresh player\" means: This likely means they haven't played before, so they don't have established patterns or strategies.\n\n5. Analyze the other player's incentives:\n   - If they think I'll choose stag, they should choose hare to get 4 points\n   - If they think I'll choose hare, they should choose stag to get 4 points\n   - The mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the best outcome for both\n\n6. Consider psychological factors: A fresh player might:\n   - Choose the safe option (hare) due to uncertainty\n   - Choose stag if they understand the mutual benefit\n   - Make a random choice\n\n7. Strategic reasoning: Since this is against a fresh player, they likely haven't developed sophisticated strategies. They might either play it safe (hare) or go for the mutual benefit (stag). \n\nGiven that the hint mentions this is a \"fresh player,\" I think there's a reasonable chance they might choose stag if they see the mutual benefit, but there's also risk they'll play it safe with hare.\n \nI'm weighing the risks carefully. Hare provides a safety net of 2-4 points, while stag offers a potential 6-point win but with a significant 1-point risk. The fresh player's unpredictability adds complexity to my decision.
