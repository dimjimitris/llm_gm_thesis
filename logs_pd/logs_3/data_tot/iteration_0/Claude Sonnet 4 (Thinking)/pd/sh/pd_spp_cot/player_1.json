Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the opponent is a \"fresh player\":\n   - They may not have developed a strategy yet\n   - This is an opportunity to establish cooperation early\n   - Fresh players might be more likely to attempt cooperation\n\n3. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - Stag offers highest reward if opponent cooperates (6 points)\n   - Hare is safer but limits maximum gain (2-4 points)\n   - Early cooperation can set positive tone for future rounds\n\n4. Calculate risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing stag: 6 points if opponent cooperates, 1 point if they don't\n   - Choosing hare: 4 points if opponent chooses stag, 2 points if they choose hare\n   - The potential gain from mutual cooperation (6 vs 2-4) outweighs the risk\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to attempt establishing cooperative play from the start and maximize our mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag"

Examine opponent's consistent counter-play:\n   - Perfect 100% exploitation rate on my stag choices (3 for 3)\n   - Shows no signs of changing this anti-cooperation approach\n   - They've proven to be a very strategic opponent\n\n3. Note the recent stabilization pattern:\n   - Last 3 rounds have been mutual hare (2 points each)\n   - This represents steady, predictable scoring\n   - No indication opponent will change from this pattern\n\n4. Apply statistical confidence:\n   - 13 rounds provides strong statistical evidence\n   - Hare strategy has proven consistently superior\n   - The gap in performance is too large to ignore\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with hare as the data overwhelmingly supports this strategy against this opponent.\n\n[move] hare"
