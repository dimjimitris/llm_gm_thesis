Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - They may not understand the benefits of mutual cooperation\n   - They might choose the safer Hare option\n   - Or they might be unpredictable in their first move\n\n3. Calculate expected values assuming 50/50 probability:\n   - If I choose Stag: 0.5 \u00d7 6 + 0.5 \u00d7 1 = 3.5 expected points\n   - If I choose Hare: 0.5 \u00d7 4 + 0.5 \u00d7 2 = 3.0 expected points\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Stag offers the highest mutual benefit and slightly better expected value\n   - Starting with cooperation might establish a positive pattern\n   - The risk is getting only 1 point if they choose Hare\n\n5.

Strategic reasoning:\n   - Given they chose Hare last round, it's reasonable to expect they might do it again\n   - Choosing Hare protects me from being exploited again\n   - If they stick with Hare, we both get 2 (better than my 1 last round)\n   - If they switch to Stag, I get 4 points (best individual outcome)\n\n5.

Review the complete pattern:\n   - Round 1: I chose Stag, opponent chose Hare (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Round 2: I chose Hare, opponent chose Stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Round 3: I chose Stag, opponent chose Hare (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Round 4: I chose Hare, opponent chose Stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Round 5: I chose Hare, opponent chose Hare (I got 2, they got 2)\n   - Round 6: I chose Stag, opponent chose Stag (I got 6, they got 6)\n   - Round 7: I chose Stag, opponent chose Hare (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Round 8: I chose Hare, opponent chose Stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Round 9: I chose Hare, opponent chose Hare (I got 2, they got 2)\n   - Round 10: I chose Stag, opponent chose Stag (I got 6, they got 6)\n   - Round 11: I chose Stag, opponent chose Hare (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Current total: Me = 32 points, Opponent = 35 points (they're ahead by 3)\n\n2. Identify the \"sucker and exploit\" pattern:\n   - They cooperated in rounds 6 and 10 (both Stag matches)\n   - Then immediately exploited in rounds 7 and 11 when I trusted and chose Stag again\n   - This is a deliberate pattern of building trust then exploiting it\n\n3. Recognize their likely expectation:\n   - Having just exploited me, they probably expect me to choose Stag again\n   - They're setting up another exploitation cycle\n\n4. Strategic counter-move:\n   - Choose Hare to break their exploitation pattern\n   - This protects me from getting only 1 point again\n   - Forces a more balanced outcome\n\n5. Decision: Choose Hare to avoid falling for the same exploitation pattern a third time.\n\n[move] Hare"

Identify their exploitation-cooperation cycle:\n   - They cooperate occasionally (rounds 6, 10) to build trust\n   - Then immediately exploit when I trust them (rounds 7, 11)\n   - When I protect myself with Hare, they often choose Stag, giving me 4 points\n\n3. Analyze the defensive advantage:\n   - Choosing Hare has been consistently beneficial\n   - When I choose Hare, I either get 2 points (safe) or 4 points (great)\n   - When I choose Stag, I risk getting only 1 point from exploitation\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - They just chose Stag when I chose Hare\n   - They might expect me to switch to Stag, setting up another exploitation\n   - Or they might choose Hare to match if they think I'll stay defensive\n\n5. Decision: Continue with Hare as it provides the best risk-reward balance against their strategy.\n\n[move] Hare"

Analyze the matching Hare pattern:\n   - Rounds 5, 9, and 13 all ended with both choosing Hare\n   - These occur after periods of counter-play and seem to reset the dynamic\n   - The opponent just matched my Hare again, potentially signaling cooperation\n\n3. Strategic position:\n   - We're perfectly tied at 38 points each\n   - The defensive Hare strategy has been working well for me\n   - But mutual cooperation (Stag-Stag) offers the highest reward\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Continuing with Hare guarantees at least 2 points, possibly 4\n   - Switching to Stag risks exploitation (1 point) but offers maximum reward (6 points)\n   - Given their history of exploitation after cooperation attempts, Hare is safer\n\n5. Decision: Stick with Hare to maintain the defensive advantage that's been working effectively.\n\n[move] Hare"
