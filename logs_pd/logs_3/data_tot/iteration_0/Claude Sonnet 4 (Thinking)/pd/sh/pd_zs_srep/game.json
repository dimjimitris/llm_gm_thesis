Try stag again (risky - could get 1 point if they choose hare, or 6 if they choose stag)\n\nGiven that they've exploited me twice when I tried to cooperate, and we've settled into a mutual hare pattern, I think the safest approach is to continue with hare.

It was a one-time defection and they might return to stag\n\nIn the stag hunt game, this is a classic dilemma. If I continue with stag and they play hare again, I get 1 point and they get 4.

In the last few rounds:\n- Round 9: opponent stag (I got 4)\n- Round 11: opponent stag (I got 4) \n\n\n- Round 14: opponent stag (I got 4)\n\nI notice a strategic test from my opponent. Their pattern reveals a calculated approach to maximize points by exploiting my cooperation. By consistently switching to hare when I play stag, they minimize my gains while protecting their own interests. My best strategy appears to be playing hare, which guarantees me either 4 or 2 points, avoiding the risky 1-point scenario when they choose hare.",
