Let me think through the strategic considerations:\n\nSteps to winning:\n\n1. Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint payoff (6+6=12 total)\n   - Mutual cooperation also gives each player the highest individual payoff when both cooperate (6 points each)\n   - However, if I choose stag and the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4 points while they get 1\n\n2. Consider the risk vs reward:\n   - Stag is the high-reward, high-risk option (6 if they cooperate, 1 if they defect)\n   - Hare is the low-reward, low-risk option (4 if they choose stag, 2 if they also choose hare)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not understand the cooperative nature of the game yet\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n   - Or they might choose randomly\n   - Or they might try to cooperate from the start\n\n4. Determine my best strategy:\n   - If I think they'll choose stag, I should choose stag (6 > 4)\n   - If I think they'll choose hare, I should choose hare (2 > 1)\n   \nI'll likely choose stag, betting on the possibility of mutual cooperation. The potential for a high payoff outweighs the risk of getting only 1 point. If they choose hare, I lose, but playing it safe guarantees a mediocre outcome.",
