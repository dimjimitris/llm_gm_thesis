Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Given we're at 3 rounds of safety post-failure, they might be approaching another stag attempt.\n\n5. Critical decision analysis:\n   - If I anticipate their stag with my own stag: Both get 6 points (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I guess wrong and choose stag while they stay safe: I get 1 point (disaster)\n   - If I stay with hare and they try stag: I get 4 points (excellent for me)\n   - If I stay with hare and they stay safe: I get 2 points (steady)\n\n6. The downside risk of guessing wrong is too severe compared to the steady performance of hare.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Even with the possibility they might try stag, hare protects me from disaster while maintaining good upside potential.\n\n[move] hare"

Complete pattern now clearly visible:\n   - Rounds 1-5: Mutual hare (initial safety)\n   - Round 6: They tried stag, failed (1 vs 4)\n   - Rounds 7-8: Mutual hare (retreat after failure #1)\n   - Round 9: They tried stag, failed again (1 vs 4)\n   - Rounds 10-12: Mutual hare (retreat after failure #2)\n   - Round 13: They tried stag, failed AGAIN (1 vs 4)\n\n3. Their behavioral pattern is extremely predictable:\n   - Play safe for 2-3 rounds after each stag failure\n   - Try stag again hoping I'll switch\n   - Get punished consistently because I stick with hare\n   - Retreat to safety and repeat the cycle\n\n4. They've now been burned three times but show persistence in trying to break the pattern.\n\n5. After this third failure, they will almost certainly retreat to hare again.\n\n6. My hare strategy has been incredibly successful:\n   - Three 4-point bonuses when they tried stag\n   - Steady 2 points in all other rounds\n   - Zero risk taken\n\n7. Next round prediction: They'll retreat to safety after this third punishment.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After their third stag failure, they'll definitely retreat to hare.
