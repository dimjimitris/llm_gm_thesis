Consider the dominant strategy - If the other player cooperates, I get 4 points by defecting vs 6 by cooperating. If the other player defects, I get 2 points by defecting vs 1 by cooperating.\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward - Defection protects me from the worst-case scenario (getting only 1 point) while still giving me a chance at the highest individual payoff (4 points).\n\n4. Consider that this is a \"fresh player\" - They may not have developed a clear strategy yet, but the safest assumption is that they will also recognize defection as the dominant strategy.\n\n5. Apply game theory logic - In a single-round prisoner's dilemma, the Nash equilibrium is for both players to defect, even though mutual cooperation would yield better results for both.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since defection is the dominant strategy that minimizes my risk while maximizing potential gain, I should defect.\n\n[move] Defection"

Consider the other player's likely reasoning - They probably face the same dilemma. Even if they want to cooperate, they might worry I'll defect and exploit their cooperation.\n\n5.

Identify what would maximize my points in isolation:\n   - If I knew the other player would cooperate, I should defect (4 > 6)\n   - If I knew the other player would defect, I should defect (2 > 1)\n   - So defection dominates cooperation from a pure self-interest perspective\n\n2. Consider what the other player might think:\n   - They face the same payoff matrix\n   - If they're rational and selfish, they should also choose defection\n   - This leads to the Nash equilibrium of both defecting for 2 points each\n\n3. Consider if there are benefits to cooperation:\n   - Mutual cooperation gives 6 points each, which is better than mutual defection (2 points each)\n   - But cooperation is risky - if they defect and I cooperate, I only get 1 point\n\n4. Consider that this is described as playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player might not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might be more likely to cooperate initially\n   - Or they might be more likely to defect out of caution\n\n5.
