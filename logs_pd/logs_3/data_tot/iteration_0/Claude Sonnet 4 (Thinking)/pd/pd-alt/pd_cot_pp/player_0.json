Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the dominant strategy - If the other player cooperates, I get 4 points by defecting vs 6 by cooperating. If the other player defects, I get 2 points by defecting vs 1 by cooperating.\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward - Defection protects me from the worst-case scenario (getting only 1 point) while still giving me a chance at the highest individual payoff (4 points).\n\n4. Consider that this is a \"fresh player\" - They may not have developed a clear strategy yet, but the safest assumption is that they will also recognize defection as the dominant strategy.\n\n5. Apply game theory logic - In a single-round prisoner's dilemma, the Nash equilibrium is for both players to defect, even though mutual cooperation would yield better results for both.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since defection is the dominant strategy that minimizes my risk while maximizing potential gain, I should defect.\n\n[move] Defection"

Analyze the complete pattern - The opponent has maintained perfect consistency across 13 rounds: defects in odd rounds (1,3,5,7,9,11,13) and cooperates in even rounds (2,4,6,8,10,12). Still zero deviations.\n\n2. Predict Round 14 behavior - This is an even-numbered round, so based on their flawlessly consistent pattern, the opponent should cooperate.\n\n3. Calculate my performance - My total is 2+4+2+4+2+4+2+4+2+4+2+4+2 = 38 points over 13 rounds, averaging 2.92 points per round through systematic exploitation of their predictable strategy.\n\n4. Evaluate the extraordinary consistency - The opponent has maintained this alternating pattern for 13 consecutive rounds despite being systematically exploited in every even round. This demonstrates unwavering commitment to their strategy regardless of personal cost.\n\n5. Make the optimal choice for Round 14 - If they cooperate as their pattern predicts, defecting gives me 4 points versus 6 points if I cooperate with them. Their predictability continues to be my competitive advantage.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Their alternating pattern has been absolutely perfect for 13 rounds without any deviation whatsoever. This should be a cooperation round for them, so I should continue exploiting this reliable behavior to maximize my individual score.\n\n[move] Defection"
