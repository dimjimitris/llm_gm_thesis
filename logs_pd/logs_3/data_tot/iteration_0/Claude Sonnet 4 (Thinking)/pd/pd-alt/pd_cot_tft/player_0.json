    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: This is a prisoner's dilemma where mutual cooperation gives the best joint outcome (6 points each), but defection can be tempting for individual gain.\n\n2. Consider the opponent: A \"fresh player\" likely hasn't developed a strategy yet and may be more inclined to start with a cooperative approach, giving the benefit of the doubt.\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - Cooperate: Potential for 6 points if opponent cooperates, risk of only 1 point if they defect\n   - Defect: Guaranteed minimum of 2 points, potential for 4 points if opponent cooperates\n\n4. Strategic reasoning: Since this appears to be an initial round with a fresh player, starting with cooperation could establish a positive pattern that benefits both players. Fresh players may be more trusting initially.\n\n5. Decision: Choose cooperation to maximize the chance of mutual benefit and set a collaborative tone.\n\n[move] cooperation"

Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - Cooperate: High likelihood of another 6-6 outcome if opponent continues cooperative pattern\n   - Defect: Could get 4 points if opponent still cooperates, but risks breaking the beneficial pattern and potentially leading to mutual defection (2-2) in future rounds\n\n4.

Evaluate opponent's absolute reliability: The other player has maintained 100% cooperation across all fifteen rounds - demonstrating complete commitment to this cooperative approach.\n\n3. Calculate mathematical superiority: Cooperation delivers 6 points vs. defection's 4 points against this reliably cooperative opponent - cooperation is objectively superior.\n\n4. Strategic comparison:\n   - Cooperate: Virtually guaranteed 6 points based on the incredibly robust and consistent pattern\n   - Defect: Only 4 points (mathematically inferior to cooperation's 6) and risk of disrupting this optimally profitable arrangement\n\n5. Analyze the partnership success: This mutual cooperation represents peak performance - both players consistently achieving the maximum possible points available in the game structure.\n\n6. Decision: Continue with cooperation, which is mathematically superior and maintains the optimal strategic outcome that has proven successful over fifteen consecutive rounds.\n\n[move] cooperation"
