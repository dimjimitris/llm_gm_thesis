Let me think about the Nash equilibrium.\n\nIf I think the other player will cooperate, I should cooperate (6 > 4).\nIf I think the other player will defect, I should defect (2 > 1).\n\nSo my best strategy depends on what I think the other player will do.\n\nSince this is described as a \"fresh player\" and this seems to be the first round, I don't have any information about their strategy.
