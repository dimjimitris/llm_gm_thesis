I responded with defection, and they also defected (we both got 2)\n\nNow I need to decide what to do. The opponent showed they're willing to break cooperation to get an advantage, but they might also be testing me or might return to cooperation. \n\nSome strategic considerations:\n- If I cooperate and they defect again, I get exploited (1 point vs their 4)\n- If I defect and they cooperate, I get the advantage (4 points vs their 1)\n- If we both cooperate, we get the best mutual outcome (6 points each)\n- If we both defect, we get a poor mutual outcome (2 points each)\n\nGiven that they broke a long streak of cooperation, I should be cautious. However, staying in mutual defection isn't optimal for either of us. I could try one more cooperation to see if they're willing to return to the mutually beneficial pattern, but that's risky. \n\nAnother approach is to defect one more time to show I won't be exploited, then potentially return to cooperation. But the opponent might be thinking the same thing.\n\nI think I'll try cooperation again - if they're rational, they should see that mutual cooperation is better than mutual defection, and the brief defection might have just been a test or mistake.",
