Since they're described as a \"fresh player,\" they might not have a sophisticated strategy yet.\n\nFrom a pure game theory perspective:\n- Hare is a \"safer\" choice because my minimum payoff is 2 (vs 1 with Stag)\n- Hare also has the highest potential payoff of 6\n- However, if both players cooperate and choose Stag, we both get 4, which is better than the 2 we'd both get if we both choose Hare\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player,\" they might:\n1. Choose randomly\n2. Go for the safer option (Hare)\n3. Try to cooperate (Stag)\n4. Try to exploit me by choosing Hare while hoping I choose Stag\n\nGiven that this is the first round and they're a fresh player, I think there's a reasonable chance they might go for Hare as it's the \"safer\" option with a higher floor and higher ceiling. \n\n\nI'll strategically choose Hare to maximize my potential gains. The risk of choosing Stag is too high, potentially leaving me with just 1 point.
