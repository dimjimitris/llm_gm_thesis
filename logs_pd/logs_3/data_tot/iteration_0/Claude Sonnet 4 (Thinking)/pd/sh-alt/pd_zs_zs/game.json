However, there's an asymmetric risk - if I cooperate with stag and they defect with hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\nSince this is a fresh player who may not yet understand the benefits of mutual cooperation, they're likely to either play it safe or try to exploit the situation. The hare move gives them a guaranteed minimum of 2 points and a potential maximum of 6 points.\n\nGiven this reasoning, and considering that hare is the safer choice that protects against exploitation while still offering upside potential, I'll choose:\n\n[move] Hare",

The (Stag, Stag) outcome is Pareto optimal - it gives the highest total payoff and the highest individual payoff when both cooperate.\n\nHowever, there's a risk with choosing Stag. If the other player chooses Hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6. On the other hand, if I choose Hare, I'm guaranteed at least 2 points, and if the other player chooses Stag, I get 6 points.\n\nThe hint mentions this is a \"fresh player\" - this could mean they're new and might not understand the game dynamics well, or it could mean they haven't developed a strategy yet.\n\nFor a fresh player, they might:\n1.
