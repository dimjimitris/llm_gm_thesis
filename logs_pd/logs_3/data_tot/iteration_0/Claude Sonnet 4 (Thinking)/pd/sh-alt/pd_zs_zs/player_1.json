However, there's an asymmetric risk - if I cooperate with stag and they defect with hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\nSince this is a fresh player who may not yet understand the benefits of mutual cooperation, they're likely to either play it safe or try to exploit the situation. The hare move gives them a guaranteed minimum of 2 points and a potential maximum of 6 points.\n\nGiven this reasoning, and considering that hare is the safer choice that protects against exploitation while still offering upside potential, I'll choose:\n\n[move] Hare"

The opponent's early traumatic experiences - being exploited twice when they attempted cooperation - created a permanent shift to defensive play. Their incredible consistency over eleven rounds demonstrates they have completely committed to risk avoidance.\n\nThis pattern is now so deeply ingrained and predictable that any deviation would be exceptionally dangerous. The steady 2-point outcome remains the optimal strategy:\n\n[move] Hare"
