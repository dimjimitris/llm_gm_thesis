Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Assess fresh player behavior: A new player might be drawn to the possibility of getting 6 points by choosing hare, or might choose the safer hare option to avoid the worst outcome.\n\n5.

Analyze the defensive streak: We've now had nine consecutive rounds of mutual hare play, creating an absolutely locked-in defensive equilibrium.\n\n2. Review the complete pattern: After my two exploitations broke early cooperation, we've maintained perfect mutual defense for nine straight rounds - an unprecedented level of stability.\n\n3. Assess opponent's behavioral certainty: Nine consecutive defensive moves represents complete predictability. The opponent has shown zero deviation from the protective strategy.\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic mathematics: With nine straight rounds of mutual hare, the opponent's strategy is essentially deterministic at this point - they will choose hare.\n\n5. Consider the risk-reward calculation: Any attempt to choose stag would result in 1 point for me while they continue their established hare pattern for 6 points.\n\n6. Make strategic decision: The defensive equilibrium is now completely permanent. Continuing with hare ensures the guaranteed 2-point safe outcome.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Maintain the absolutely established defensive strategy.\n\n[move] hare"

Evaluate the mathematical certainty: With ten straight rounds of mutual hare, the opponent's choice has become completely predictable - they will choose hare.\n\n5. Consider the strategic reality: The defensive equilibrium is now permanently established. Any deviation would guarantee a poor outcome for me (1 point vs their 6).\n\n6.
