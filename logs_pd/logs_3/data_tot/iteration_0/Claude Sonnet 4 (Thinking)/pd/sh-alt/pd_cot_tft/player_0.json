Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the risk-reward trade-off:\n   - Stag: Potential for 4 points but risk of only getting 1 point\n   - Hare: Guaranteed minimum of 2 points with potential for 6 points\n\n3. Assess opponent behavior:\n   - Playing against a fresh player with no established pattern\n   - Fresh players often choose safer options when uncertain\n   - The hare option provides better protection against being exploited\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - Hare dominates stag in terms of guaranteed minimum payoff\n   - Even if opponent cooperates with stag, the difference between 6 and 4 points favors hare when I expect them to also play hare\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare for better risk management and higher expected value against an unknown opponent.\n\n[move] hare"

Predict opponent's likely response:\n   - Fresh players often learn quickly from negative outcomes\n   - Getting only 1 point while I got 6 creates incentive to avoid being exploited again\n   - Most likely they will switch to hare as a defensive move\n\n3. Consider my options given likely opponent response:\n   - If opponent switches to hare and I choose hare: we both get 2 points\n   - If opponent switches to hare and I choose stag: I get 1, opponent gets 6 (bad for me)\n   - If opponent sticks with stag and I choose hare: I get 6, opponent gets 1 (repeat success)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Hare provides guaranteed minimum of 2 points\n   - Stag is very risky if opponent has learned to play defensively\n   - The psychological pressure on opponent favors them choosing hare\n\n5.

Analyze the deeply entrenched pattern:\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 6, opponent got 1\n   - Rounds 2-12: Both chose hare \u2192 We both got 2 each round\n   - Opponent has now chosen hare for 11 consecutive rounds with perfect consistency\n\n2. Assess the overwhelming evidence:\n   - Eleven identical defensive moves without any variation\n   - Behavior suggests complete strategic entrenchment\n   - No signs of experimentation or willingness to risk cooperation\n\n3. Consider the risk of attempting cooperation:\n   - If I switch to stag and opponent maintains hare pattern: I get 1, they get 6 (disaster)\n   - If I switch to stag and opponent also switches: We both get 4 (better outcome)\n   - Given 11 consecutive hare moves, probability of opponent maintaining pattern is extremely high\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic mathematics:\n   - Risk of exploitation is very high given opponent's consistent defensive behavior\n   - Potential reward (4 vs 2) doesn't justify the high probability of getting only 1 point\n   - Current equilibrium provides predictable, steady scoring\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Eleven rounds of identical play indicates permanent defensive commitment\n   - Continue with hare to maintain safe scoring against this absolutely predictable opponent\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Maintain hare strategy against this completely entrenched defensive player.\n\n[move] hare"
