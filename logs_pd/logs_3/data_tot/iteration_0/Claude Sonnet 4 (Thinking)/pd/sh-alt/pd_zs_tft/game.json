      "reasoning_text": "My opponent has now played hare for fourteen consecutive rounds. This is an absolutely extraordinary pattern of consistency. They have shown complete commitment to defensive play and risk avoidance.\n\nAt this point, I need to consider:\n1. They have shown absolutely no deviation from defensive play for 14 rounds\n2. If they do switch to stag, my hare choice protects me and gives me 6 points\n3. If they continue with hare, we both get 2 points\n4. If I switch to stag and they continue their defensive pattern, I only get 1 point while they get 6\n\nGiven their demonstrated extreme consistency over 14 rounds, switching to stag would be very risky. They have shown absolutely no signs of changing their strategy. Hare continues to be the optimal choice - it protects against their potential exploitation while maintaining the steady 2-point outcome if they continue their pattern.",
