My opponent has shown complete unwavering commitment to this safe approach across an extraordinary number of rounds, demonstrating beyond any doubt their preference for guaranteed outcomes over potential higher rewards.\n\nThe consistency has reached such an extreme level that their next move is entirely predictable. They've established their strategic identity through relentless repetition.\n\n[move] (fourteen rounds of perfect consistency leaves absolutely no uncertainty about their choice) hare",

          "reasoning_text": "This is now fourteen consecutive rounds of mutual hare choices. The pattern is extremely well established. My opponent has shown no deviation whatsoever from choosing hare, and they seem completely committed to this safe strategy that guarantees 2 points per round.\n\nAt this point, there's really no reason to expect any change in their behavior. They've had many opportunities to signal cooperation or try for the higher mutual reward of 4 points each by choosing stag, but they consistently choose the safe option.\n\nGiven this extremely consistent pattern, I should continue with hare as well.",
