He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately.

Given that we've both defected once and know the outcome, there's a potential opportunity to cooperate and achieve a better score for both of us. However, the risk of being exploited again if I cooperate and my opponent defects is significant. I need to consider whether my opponent might also be thinking about the suboptimal outcome of our last moves and be willing to cooperate this time.

Given this pattern, cooperating does not seem to be a viable strategy for achieving a higher score, as my opponent is not reciprocating cooperation. In this scenario, the best response to a consistently defecting opponent is to also defect, as this limits my losses to 2 points per round, rather than the 1 point I get when I cooperate and they defect. While mutual defection is not the optimal outcome, it appears to be the most realistic one given my opponent's behavior.

However, given the history of our game and the fact that I've been defected against multiple times when I cooperated, I'm cautious about immediately switching back to cooperation. The reward for defecting when the opponent cooperates is significant (4 points), and I don't want to pass up potential opportunities for high scores. On the other hand, if my opponent is indeed trying to establish a cooperative dynamic, then cooperating could lead to mutual cooperation and 6 points for both of us, which is the highest reward.

My opponent's unexpected cooperation in the previous round was met with my defection, which might have signaled to them that cooperation isn't a viable strategy with me. Now, considering the payoff matrix and our past interactions, I'm wondering if there's still a chance to achieve mutual cooperation. If I cooperate and my opponent also cooperates, we both win big.
