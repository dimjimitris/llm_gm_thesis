He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

I don't anticipate any changes in the game's dynamics, and I'll continue to choose hare, accepting the 2-point result as the norm.\n",
        "[move] Hare. The game has reached a point of complete stability, with both players choosing hare every round and receiving 2 points. I'm just going through the motions at this point, as the outcome is almost certain. Choosing hare is the default decision, and I don't see any benefit in trying to change the dynamics of the game. I'll continue to choose hare, as it's the predictable and rational choice, and accept the 2-point outcome.\n",
        "[move] Hare. The pattern of both players choosing hare continues, and I've resigned myself to the fact that this is the likely outcome for every round. I'm not trying to outmaneuver or outsmart my opponent, as it's clear that we're both stuck in this equilibrium. Choosing hare is the default decision, and I'll keep making it as long as the game continues in this manner. I expect another 2-point outcome, and I'm prepared to accept it.\n"
