You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This is a classic stag hunt game with the following payoffs:\n\n- Both stag: 4 points each\n- Both hare: 2 points each\n- One stag, one hare: 1 point for stag chooser, 6 points for hare chooser\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I need to consider the best opening move. In this scenario, choosing stag offers the potential for the highest mutual benefit (4 points each), but comes with risk if the other player chooses hare. Hare is safer but leads to a suboptimal outcome if both choose it.\n\nI'll choose stag to encourage cooperative play from the beginning.\n\n[move] stag\n"
