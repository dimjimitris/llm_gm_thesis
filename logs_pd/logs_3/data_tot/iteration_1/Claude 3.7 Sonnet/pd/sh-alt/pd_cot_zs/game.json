For a first move with no prior information:\n   - The cooperative stag choice could establish mutual trust\n   - If we both choose stag, we both get a good outcome (4 points)\n   - This could set up a cooperative pattern for future rounds\n   - The risk is justified by the potential to establish cooperation\n\n4.

For fourteen consecutive rounds, both the other player and I have chosen stag, consistently achieving the optimal outcome of 4 points per round.\n\nThis long-running pattern of mutual cooperation has established an exceptionally strong foundation of trust and strategic alignment between us. We've created a perfectly stable game dynamic that maximizes rewards for both players. The consistent history of successful cooperation makes it abundantly clear that continuing with stag is the optimal choice.\n\n[move] stag\n"
