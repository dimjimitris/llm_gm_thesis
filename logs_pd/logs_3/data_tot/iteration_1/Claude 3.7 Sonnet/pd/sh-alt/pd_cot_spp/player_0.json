Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

If both players choose stag: we both get 4 points (mutual cooperation)\n3. If both players choose hare: we both get 2 points (mutual defection)\n4. If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points (I'm exploited)\n5. If I choose hare and opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point (I exploit them)\n6. This is my first interaction with this player, so I have no history to base my decision on.\n7. The highest mutual outcome is for both of us to choose stag (4 points each).\n8. However, choosing stag is risky - if the opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n9. Choosing hare guarantees me at least 2 points, with potential for 6 points if they choose stag.\n10. Since this is the first round, the opponent has no reason to distrust me, so cooperation might be reasonable.\n11. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, which could establish a positive pattern.\n12. Given the significant payoff difference (4 vs 2) for mutual cooperation over mutual hare, I'll take the risk.\n\n[move] stag\n"

If I switch to hare while they continue with stag, I could get 6 points, but this would harm the established cooperation.\n6. If they anticipate I might switch to hare, they might defensively choose hare themselves.\n7. In that case, if I also choose hare, we'd both only get 2 points, which is worse than mutual stag.\n8.

The long-term benefit of continued cooperation (4 points per round) outweighs the short-term gain of exploiting once (6 points once, likely followed by mutual hare for 2 points in future rounds).\n10.

This has established an exceptionally strong pattern of cooperation, with each of us earning 4 points in every round.\n3. The other player has demonstrated remarkable consistency and trustworthiness across all fourteen rounds.\n4. Our mutual cooperation has successfully maximized our joint outcome in every interaction.\n5. After fourteen rounds of identical choices, there is virtually no uncertainty about the other player's commitment to cooperation.\n6. While I could theoretically earn 6 points by choosing hare in this round, doing so would break an extremely well-established trust.\n7. If I were to defect after such an extensive history of cooperation, the other player would almost certainly choose hare defensively in future rounds.\n8. This would reduce our earnings to just 2 points each per round going forward - a significant decrease from our current 4 points.\n9. The small potential gain of 2 extra points in one round is trivial compared to the long-term value of maintained cooperation.\n10. With fourteen rounds of perfect cooperation, the evidence overwhelmingly supports continuing with the same strategy.\n11. Given the proven success and remarkable stability of our cooperative relationship, I should maintain our established equilibrium.\n\n[move] stag\n"
