However, when I choose stag, they often choose hare (except rounds 6 and 12).\n\nWhile we've occasionally achieved mutual cooperation, it hasn't been sustained. Given that choosing hare when they choose stag has consistently given me the highest points (6), I'll continue with this strategy.\n\n[move] hare. Following the established pattern that has maximized my points in this game.\n"

This suggests there might be a pattern where cooperation can emerge after symmetric plays.\n\nI'll try stag again to see if this pattern holds true and we can establish another round of mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] stag. Choosing stag based on the observed pattern that mutual cooperation often follows symmetric plays.\n"
