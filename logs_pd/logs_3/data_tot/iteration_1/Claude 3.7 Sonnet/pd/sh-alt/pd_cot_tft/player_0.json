He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where cooperation (both choosing stag) yields the best collective outcome.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I have no information about their tendencies.\n\n4. If we both choose stag, we both get 4 points - a good outcome.\n\n5. If I choose stag but they choose hare, I only get 1 point - the worst outcome for me.\n\n6. If I choose hare, I guarantee at least 2 points (if they also choose hare), with the potential for 6 points if they choose stag.\n\n7. However, choosing stag demonstrates willingness to cooperate, which might establish trust for future rounds.\n\n8. In the first round with no information about the opponent, I'll choose stag to encourage mutual cooperation, which leads to the best sustainable outcome for both players.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to establish mutual cooperation, which provides the best collective outcome.\n"

My opponent defected in round 2 after we cooperated in round 1, suggesting they might be opportunistic.\n\n3. When I responded by choosing hare in round 3, they also chose hare, resulting in a suboptimal outcome for both of us (2 points each instead of the potential 4 points each).\n\n4. This could indicate they are using a reactive strategy - they might have expected me to choose hare after they defected, so they protected themselves.\n\n5. We're now in a state of mutual defection, which yields less points (2 each) than mutual cooperation (4 each).\n\n6. There are two possible interpretations:\n   - My opponent is simply opportunistic and will always defect\n   - My opponent was testing me and might be willing to return to cooperation\n\n7.

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both chose stag \u2192 4 points each (mutual cooperation)\n   - Round 2: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 1 point for me, 6 for them (they defected)\n   - Round 3: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each (mutual defection)\n   - Round 4: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 1 point for me, 6 for them (they defected again)\n   - Round 5: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each (mutual defection)\n   - Round 6: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each (mutual defection)\n   - Round 7: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each (mutual defection)\n   - Round 8: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each (mutual defection)\n   - Round 9: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each (mutual defection)\n   - Round 10: Both chose hare \u2192 2 points each (mutual defection)\n\n2. We're now entering Round 11, having played 10 rounds already with a very clear pattern established.\n\n3. My opponent has chosen hare for 9 consecutive rounds, showing complete consistency in their strategy since Round 2.\n\n4. We've now had 6 consecutive rounds of mutual defection (both choosing hare).\n\n5. At this point in a repeated game, there might be some value in attempting a \"surprise\" strategy shift to see if it can break us out of this suboptimal equilibrium.\n\n6. However, given my opponent's unwavering commitment to choosing hare, including exploiting my cooperation attempts twice, the probability of them responding positively to a cooperation attempt seems extremely low.\n\n7. If I choose stag and they continue with hare (highly likely based on their established pattern), I would get only 1 point instead of the guaranteed 2 points from choosing hare.\n\n8. The expected utility calculation still strongly favors choosing hare, given my opponent's demonstrated behavior.\n\n9. While mutual cooperation would be preferable (4 points each), it requires both players to choose stag, and my opponent has shown no indication of willingness to make this choice after Round 1.\n\n10. After 10 rounds of consistent behavior, it seems highly unlikely that my opponent will suddenly change their strategy, so the rational choice remains choosing hare.\n\n[move] hare I'm continuing with hare as my opponent has shown an unwavering commitment to choosing hare for nine consecutive rounds, making this my best option to secure consistent points.\n"

We've now had 7 consecutive rounds of mutual defection (both choosing hare).\n\n5. At this extreme level of consistency, it becomes reasonable to question whether my opponent is capable of or willing to ever choose stag again.\n\n6. In game theory, when an opponent shows such unwavering commitment to a strategy, the best response continues to be the one that maximizes expected utility against that strategy.\n\n7. Against an opponent who always chooses hare, the best response is to always choose hare (giving me 2 points instead of 1).\n\n8. While I could attempt to break the pattern by choosing stag, the historical evidence strongly suggests this would result in exploitation rather than mutual cooperation.\n\n9. After 11 rounds with such a clear pattern, the probability of my opponent suddenly changing their strategy is vanishingly small.\n\n10.
