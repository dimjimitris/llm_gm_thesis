However, choosing hare is less risky - I get at least 2 points if they also choose hare, and 6 if they choose stag.\n\n6.

Having just been \"burned\" by cooperating while I defected, my opponent has two likely responses:\n   - They might continue choosing stag, believing in maintaining a cooperative stance\n   - They might switch to hare to avoid being exploited again\n\n4.

The opponent may be less likely to choose stag again after being exploited, so choosing hare again might be safer and yield at least 2 points.\n\n6.

It seems like we're both trying to anticipate each other's moves, but haven't established a cooperative pattern.\n\n3. The most beneficial outcome for both of us would be mutual stag selection (4 points each).\n\n4. Since we both chose hare last round, there might be an opportunity to break out of this pattern and establish cooperation.\n\n5. My opponent might be thinking along the same lines - after a round of mutual hare (suboptimal for both), they might try stag to see if we can reach mutual cooperation.\n\n6.
