Let me identify relevant personas and begin the collaboration.\n\nPersonas: \n- Game Theorist\n- Strategic Planner\n- Psychological Analyst\n- Decision Scientist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is clearly a variant of the classic Stag Hunt game in game theory, with a twist in the payoff matrix. Let me analyze the payoffs:\n- Both choose stag: both get 4 points (cooperative outcome)\n- Both choose hare: both get 2 points (safe but suboptimal)\n- One chooses stag, one chooses hare: stag-chooser gets 1, hare-chooser gets 6\n\nThis is interesting because the Nash equilibria are both (stag, stag) and (hare, hare), but (stag, stag) is Pareto optimal.\n\nStrategic Planner: We're playing against a fresh player who hasn't established a pattern yet. We need to decide whether to risk cooperation for mutual benefit or play it safe. The risk-reward tradeoff is clear: choosing stag has the potential for the highest mutual benefit but also the greatest vulnerability if exploited.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Since this is the first round, we have no prior history to base decisions on. Players often start with cooperative moves in repeated games to signal willingness to cooperate. However, some might exploit this expectation by choosing hare immediately. Since the other player is described as \"fresh,\" they might not have sophisticated strategies yet.\n\nDecision Scientist: Let's evaluate expected values. If we assume a 50-50 chance of the opponent choosing either move:\n- Expected value of choosing stag: 0.5*4 + 0.5*1 = 2.5 points\n- Expected value of choosing hare: 0.5*6 + 0.5*2 = 4 points\n\nPurely mathematically, hare has a higher expected value against a random player.\n\nGame Theorist: But this isn't a one-shot game - it's likely to be repeated. In repeated games, establishing cooperation can be valuable. By choosing stag first, we signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with establishing cooperation early. If we choose stag and they choose stag too, we both benefit and might continue this pattern. If they exploit us by choosing hare, we can adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Many studies show that humans tend to start with cooperative moves in these scenarios. Let's assume our opponent will likely choose stag to begin with, making stag our best choice as well.\n\nDecision Scientist: While the pure numbers favor hare, the long-term benefits of establishing cooperation through choosing stag could outweigh the short-term advantage of choosing hare. Since this is the first round, I'm inclined to agree with trying to establish cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's choose stag for this opening round. It signals cooperative intent and if reciprocated, establishes the most mutually beneficial equilibrium.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I'll choose cooperation for mutual benefit in this opening round.\n"

In the first round, both players chose stag, resulting in the optimal cooperative outcome where we both received 4 points. This suggests that the other player may also be following a cooperative strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: This is a promising development. The other player chose stag in the first round, suggesting they're either naturally cooperative or strategically inclined toward mutual benefit. This cooperative behavior increases the likelihood they'll choose stag again.\n\nPsychological Analyst: There's strong evidence of cooperative intent from our opponent. When players experience success with cooperation (as we both did with 4 points), they tend to continue that pattern. The psychological momentum favors continued cooperation.\n\nDecision Scientist: Let's analyze the expected value again, but now with updated probabilities. Since the other player chose stag in the first round, let's estimate they have a 75-80% probability of choosing stag again:\n- Expected value of choosing stag: 0.8*4 + 0.2*1 = 3.4 points\n- Expected value of choosing hare: 0.8*6 + 0.2*2 = 5.2 points\n\nMathematically, hare still has a higher expected value, but this doesn't account for long-term implications.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, maintaining the cooperative equilibrium is usually the most beneficial long-term strategy as long as both players continue to cooperate. By continuing to choose stag, we reinforce the cooperative pattern and build trust.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. If we defect to hare after a successful cooperative round, we might get 6 points this round, but it would likely break the cooperative pattern for future rounds, limiting our long-term gains.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Defecting now would likely trigger reciprocal defection in future rounds. The one-time gain of exploiting their cooperation would likely be outweighed by lost cooperative opportunities in subsequent rounds.\n\nDecision Scientist: While the immediate expected value calculation favors hare, the long-term expected value across multiple rounds strongly favors continuing with stag to maintain cooperation. This is especially true if we anticipate many rounds of play.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's stick with stag for this round. It reinforces the cooperative equilibrium we've established and signals our continued intention to maximize mutual benefit.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Continuing cooperative strategy based on our successful first round.\n"

Our opponent chose hare while we chose stag, resulting in us receiving only 1 point while they received 6 points. This suggests they may be employing an exploitative strategy rather than aiming for mutual cooperation.\n\nStrategic Planner: We need to reconsider our approach. Our cooperative strategy has been exploited, and continuing with stag against an opponent who has demonstrated willingness to choose hare puts us at continued risk of minimal returns.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This behavior pattern is quite telling. The opponent started with stag to potentially establish trust, then switched to hare to maximize their gain. This could be a \"lure and exploit\" tactic. They may now expect us to also choose hare in retaliation, in which case they might actually return to stag to exploit us again, or they may continue with hare expecting us to switch.\n\nDecision Scientist: Let's update our probability model. Given that they've now demonstrated both cooperative and exploitative behavior, we need to reassess:\n- If we choose stag: Expected outcome is poor if they choose hare again\n- If we choose hare: We protect against exploitation and could get 6 points if they return to stag, or 2 points if they continue with hare\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, one effective strategy in iterated games is \"tit for tat\" - do what your opponent did in the previous round. Since they chose hare last round, tit for tat would suggest choosing hare now.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with shifting to hare for this round. It serves multiple purposes: it protects us from continued exploitation, signals that we won't accept unilateral defection, and potentially allows us to score higher if they return to stag.\n\nPsychological Analyst: A measured response is important. By choosing hare after they chose hare, we're communicating that we're willing to respond in kind, but not escalating the situation. This might lead to a reset of expectations and potentially return to cooperative play in future rounds.\n\nDecision Scientist: The math now clearly favors hare. Even with uncertain probabilities about our opponent's next move, hare minimizes our downside risk (2 points instead of 1) and maximizes our upside potential (6 points instead of 4).\n\nGame Theorist: Let's implement the tit for tat approach and choose hare for this round. This is both a protective measure and a signal that we respond to how we're treated.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] hare Responding to opponent's previous non-cooperative choice to prevent continued exploitation.\n"

Both players chose hare in the last round, resulting in suboptimal but equal payoffs of 2 points each. We're now at a less efficient Nash equilibrium. Let's analyze the game history:\n- Round 1: Both chose stag (4 points each)\n- Round 2: We chose stag, they chose hare (1 point for us, 6 for them)\n- Round 3: Both chose hare (2 points each)\n\nStrategic Planner: Our opponent has shown inconsistency - cooperative in round 1, exploitative in round 2, and then matched our hare choice in round 3. This could indicate they're following a responsive strategy similar to tit-for-tat, or they might be testing different approaches to see what works best.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The pattern suggests they may indeed be using a strategy similar to tit-for-tat but with an exploitative bias. They cooperated, then exploited, then matched our move. If they're following this pattern, they might expect us to continue with hare and do the same.\n\nDecision Scientist: We now have more data to work with. If they're using a strategy based on our previous moves, they might expect us to continue with hare and match that. However, if we want to attempt to restore cooperation, we might consider returning to stag.\n\nGame Theorist: This is where we can potentially use the \"forgiveness\" aspect of successful strategies like tit-for-tat with forgiveness. After a mutual defection (both choosing hare), occasionally returning to cooperation (stag) can break cycles of mutual punishment and restore cooperation.\n\nStrategic Planner: I see two viable options: \n1. Continue with hare as a safe option that guarantees at least 2 points\n2. Risk returning to stag to attempt to restore the more beneficial cooperative equilibrium\n\nPsychological Analyst: Returning to stag sends a strong signal of willingness to cooperate despite past exploitation. This can be particularly effective after a mutual defection round, as it offers an \"olive branch\" that intelligent opponents often recognize and reciprocate.\n\nDecision Scientist: Let's weigh the risk-reward balance. If we choose stag:\n- Best case: They also choose stag, we both get 4 points\n- Worst case: They choose hare again, we get only 1 point\nIf we choose hare:\n- Best case: They choose stag, we get 6 points\n- Worst case: They choose hare again, we get 2 points\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games with uncertain endpoints, periodically testing for cooperation can be valuable. After a period of mutual defection, successful strategies often include mechanisms to escape these punishment cycles and restore cooperation.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given that we've only played 3 rounds so far, I believe it's worth taking the risk to try to restore cooperation rather than settling into the less efficient equilibrium of mutual hare choices.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. The potential gain from restored cooperation over multiple future rounds outweighs the risk of being exploited in this single round.\n\nDecision Scientist: While the immediate expected value might favor hare, the long-term expected value across future rounds favors attempting to restore cooperation by choosing stag now.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's choose stag for this round as an attempt to break out of the mutual defection cycle and restore the more beneficial cooperative equilibrium.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Attempting to restore mutual cooperation for greater joint benefit.\n"

Our opponent has chosen hare when we chose stag for the second time. Let's review the complete game history:\n- Round 1: Both stag (4 points each)\n- Round 2: We stag, they hare (1 point for us, 6 for them)\n- Round 3: Both hare (2 points each)\n- Round 4: We stag, they hare (1 point for us, 6 for them)\n\nThis suggests our opponent may be primarily focused on maximizing their own score rather than establishing cooperative equilibrium.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our attempt to restore cooperation has been met with exploitation again. This is a strong indicator that our opponent is either following a strategy designed to maximize their own points regardless of cooperation, or they're specifically exploiting our attempts to cooperate.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The pattern is becoming clearer. Our opponent appears to be taking advantage of our cooperative moves while avoiding the risk of being exploited themselves. They might be assuming we'll alternate between stag and hare based on their actions, allowing them to predict and counter our moves.\n\nDecision Scientist: The empirical evidence now strongly suggests that choosing stag against this opponent results in exploitation. We've scored only 1 point in both rounds where we chose stag while they chose hare. In contrast, when we chose hare, we secured at least 2 points.\n\nGame Theorist: At this point, the data suggests our opponent is not interested in establishing the cooperative equilibrium. In such cases, game theory would recommend protecting our interests by choosing the strategy that minimizes exploitation, which is hare.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. We've given cooperation multiple chances, and our opponent has consistently exploited those opportunities. Strategic prudence now dictates choosing hare to protect our score and potentially benefit if they ever switch to stag.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This opponent seems to be consistently exploitative when given the opportunity. Further attempts at cooperation are likely to result in continued exploitation rather than reciprocity.\n\nDecision Scientist: The math is now very clear:\n- Expected value of choosing stag: Likely very low given their pattern\n- Expected value of choosing hare: Guaranteed minimum of 2 points, with potential for 6 if they switch\n\nGame Theorist: Let's implement hare as our consistent strategy moving forward. This approach serves both as protection against exploitation and as a clear signal that we will not continue to allow ourselves to be exploited.\n\nStrategic Planner: I concur. Until we see clear evidence of a shift in our opponent's strategy, maintaining hare as our choice is the most prudent approach.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This is also psychologically sound. Continuing to choose stag despite repeated exploitation would be a form of \"cooperative blindness\" that rational players should avoid.\n\nDecision Scientist: The data overwhelmingly supports choosing hare at this point. The risk-reward ratio of choosing stag has proven unfavorable across multiple trials.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] hare Adopting a protective strategy based on opponent's consistent pattern of exploitation.\n"

They started with stag perhaps to build false trust, then consistently exploited our cooperative moves. When we chose hare defensively, they avoided the risk of choosing stag. This suggests they are risk-averse when they can't exploit but opportunistic when they can.\n\nDecision Scientist: Let's evaluate our options:\n1) Continue with hare: Guarantees at least 2 points, prevents exploitation\n2) Try stag again: High risk of another exploitation (1 point), but potential for mutual cooperation (4 points)\n\nGiven the established pattern, the expected value still favors hare, but we should consider if there's any strategic advantage to testing their response to a different pattern from us.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, establishing patterns and then breaking them can sometimes yield information about an opponent's strategy. However, given our opponent's consistency in exploiting cooperative moves, there's little evidence to suggest they would respond cooperatively to another stag choice.\n\nStrategic Planner: I believe continuing with hare is our best option. We've tested cooperation twice and been exploited both times. Our opponent hasn't shown any indication they're interested in mutual cooperation, so protecting our points takes priority.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. Their behavior suggests they're unlikely to shift to cooperation unless forced to by circumstance. Continuing with hare maintains our minimum acceptable outcome while avoiding the risk of further exploitation.\n\nDecision Scientist: The empirical evidence supports continuing with hare. We consistently score 2 points with this choice against this opponent, while stag has only yielded 1 point except in the very first round.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's maintain our hare strategy. This puts pressure on the opponent - if they want to improve beyond 2 points per round, they'll need to risk choosing stag first, which might eventually force a more cooperative dynamic.\n\nStrategic Planner: This approach also communicates that we've recognized their pattern and aren't willing to be repeatedly exploited. Sometimes establishing this boundary is necessary before cooperation can be rebuilt on more equal terms.\n\nDecision Scientist: I concur. The data supports continuing with hare as our optimal strategy against this particular opponent until we see evidence of a strategy shift on their part.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] hare Maintaining consistent defensive strategy based on opponent's established pattern of exploiting cooperative moves.\n"

Our opponent has shown no indication of deviating from their pattern: they exploit when we choose stag and choose hare when we choose hare.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This consistent pattern suggests our opponent may be using a simple rule-based strategy rather than complex game theory. They appear to be using a greedy approach that maximizes their immediate points rather than working toward mutual benefit.\n\nDecision Scientist: After six rounds, we have strong statistical evidence of our opponent's strategy. When we choose stag, they consistently choose hare (2/2 times). When we choose hare, they consistently choose hare (3/3 times). The expected values strongly favor continuing with hare.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, there's a concept of \"conditional cooperation\" - occasionally testing whether an opponent is willing to cooperate even after a series of defections. However, given our opponent's consistent exploitation when we've chosen stag, the risk-reward ratio doesn't favor such a test yet.\n\nStrategic Planner: I see three possible approaches:\n1) Continue with hare as our safe strategy\n2) Test cooperation with stag again to see if their strategy has evolved\n3) Establish a new pattern to see if they respond to it\n\nPsychological Analyst: The opponent may be getting comfortable with the current equilibrium of mutual hare choices. There's a small possibility they might eventually test cooperation to improve outcomes, but they've shown no signs of this yet.\n\nDecision Scientist: Let's quantify the risk-reward tradeoff of testing stag again:\n- If we choose stag: 20% chance they choose stag (4 points), 80% chance they choose hare (1 point) = Expected value of 1.6 points\n- If we choose hare: 10% chance they choose stag (6 points), 90% chance they choose hare (2 points) = Expected value of 2.4 points\n\nEven with generous assumptions about their potential cooperation, hare still has a higher expected value.\n\nGame Theorist: Given our limited number of rounds played, continuing with the established equilibrium of hare seems most rational. We've tested cooperation enough to establish that this opponent is likely to exploit it.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Maintaining our hare strategy continues to protect us from exploitation while we gather more data about their long-term strategy.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The consistent mutual hare outcome might eventually cause them to test a different approach, but we shouldn't be the ones to take that risk given their exploitation history.\n\nDecision Scientist: The empirical data strongly supports continuing with hare.

Our opponent continues to choose hare when we choose hare, creating a stable but suboptimal outcome for both players. Neither player is maximizing their potential points.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This extended pattern suggests our opponent may be quite comfortable with the consistent, low-risk outcome of 2 points per round. They've shown no initiative to break this pattern, despite the potential for higher mutual returns through cooperation.\n\nDecision Scientist: From a purely statistical standpoint, our opponent has chosen hare in response to our hare choice in 4/4 rounds. Their strategy appears highly predictable at this point.\n\nGame Theorist: After several rounds of stable mutual defection, there's a game theory principle that suggests occasionally testing for cooperation can be valuable. This is particularly true when both players seem locked in a suboptimal equilibrium for an extended period.\n\nStrategic Planner: I see merit in considering a strategic shift. We've established that choosing hare consistently yields 2 points against this opponent. The question is whether there's value in testing if their strategy has evolved after this extended period of mutual hare choices.\n\nPsychological Analyst: There's a psychological phenomenon where players become more willing to cooperate after an extended period of mutual defection, especially when they recognize the suboptimal nature of the outcomes. Our opponent may now be more receptive to a cooperative signal than they were earlier.\n\nDecision Scientist: Let's reassess the risk-reward calculation:\n- If we choose stag: There's still significant risk of exploitation (1 point) but also potential for mutual cooperation (4 points)\n- If we choose hare: We maintain our consistent 2-point outcome with high certainty\n\nThe expected value calculation still mathematically favors hare based on past behavior, but there's potential strategic value in testing for a strategy shift.\n\nGame Theorist: In infinitely repeated games, the most successful strategies typically include some mechanism for breaking out of mutual defection cycles. Given the extended period of mutual hare choices, this might be an appropriate time to test whether cooperation can be established.\n\nStrategic Planner: I believe there's strategic merit in testing stag now. After four consecutive rounds of mutual hare, our opponent might be reconsidering their approach. If they continue to exploit, we can immediately return to hare in the following round, limiting our downside to a single round.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The timing feels appropriate for such a test. We've demonstrated our willingness to play defensively for an extended period, which may have changed how our opponent perceives the game dynamics.\n\nDecision Scientist: While the pure numbers still favor hare, I acknowledge the strategic value in occasionally testing for cooperation in repeated games. The potential upside of establishing mutual cooperation (4 points per round vs. 2) is significant if successful.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's choose stag for this round as a strategic test. If exploited again, we can immediately return to hare, having confirmed our opponent's unwillingness to cooperate.

The opponent has now exploited us all three times we've chosen stag, including after an extended period of mutual hare choices.\n\nStrategic Planner: This is definitive evidence that our opponent is committed to an exploitative strategy. They consistently choose hare when we choose stag, regardless of game history or potential for establishing better mutual outcomes.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Their behavior shows a strong preference for maximizing their own immediate gain without regard for mutual benefit or long-term outcomes. They appear to be playing purely to maximize their own score rather than finding cooperative equilibrium.\n\nDecision Scientist: The data is now overwhelming. We've tested cooperation three times across different points in the game, and each time we've been exploited. The probability that they will cooperate appears to be extremely low, approaching zero.\n\nGame Theorist: With this additional data point, we can confidently conclude that our opponent is using a strategy that will always exploit cooperation. In game theory terms, against such an opponent, the optimal counter-strategy is to consistently choose hare.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree completely. We've exhaustively tested for cooperation potential and found none. Our optimal strategy is now clear: choose hare for all remaining rounds to secure consistent 2-point outcomes and prevent further exploitation.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This opponent has shown remarkable consistency in their exploitative approach. Any further attempts at cooperation would simply be giving away points without strategic benefit.\n\nDecision Scientist: The empirical evidence now strongly supports a pure hare strategy for the remainder of the game. The expected value calculation overwhelmingly favors hare against this opponent:\n- Expected value of stag: ~1 point (based on 0/3 cooperative responses)\n- Expected value of hare: 2 points (based on 4/4 matching responses)\n\nGame Theorist: Let's commit to a consistent hare strategy for all remaining rounds. Against this particular opponent, this is the rational Nash equilibrium strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: This approach minimizes our risk while maintaining a reasonable point accumulation. Given the opponent's revealed strategy, we can't do better than consistently choosing hare.\n\nDecision Scientist: I concur. The data conclusively supports hare as our optimal choice against this opponent's strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] hare Returning to defensive strategy after confirming opponent's consistent pattern of exploitation.\n"

They have exploited cooperation 3/3 times and matched our defensive hare play 5/5 times. This leaves no doubt about their strategic approach.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Their behavior demonstrates an unwavering commitment to maximizing their own score without concern for establishing mutual benefit.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
