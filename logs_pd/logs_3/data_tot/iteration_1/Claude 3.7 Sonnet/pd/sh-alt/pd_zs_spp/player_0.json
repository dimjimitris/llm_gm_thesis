These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The hare strategy is safer but offers less mutual reward. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\nChoosing stag represents the cooperative approach with higher mutual benefit.
