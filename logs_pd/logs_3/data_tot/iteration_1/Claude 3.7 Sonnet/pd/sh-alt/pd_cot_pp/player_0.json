The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - If both choose stag: 4 points each\n   - If both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1\n\n2. This is a classic coordination game with two Nash equilibria: both choose stag or both choose hare.\n\n3. The stag equilibrium (both choose stag) is Pareto-optimal, meaning it maximizes total welfare - we both get 4 points.\n\n4. However, choosing stag is risky - if my opponent chooses hare while I choose stag, I only get 1 point.\n\n5. The hint indicates I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no prior history, so I have no information about their tendencies.\n\n6. In the absence of coordination or prior history, I should consider what a rational player would do.\n\n7. A rational player should recognize that mutual stag hunting yields the highest collective reward, but requires trust.\n\n8. Since this appears to be the first round, establishing cooperative behavior might lead to better outcomes in future rounds if we play repeatedly.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will choose stag, hoping to establish a cooperative pattern.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Now I need to determine whether my opponent:\n   - Is simply maximizing their own short-term gain\n   - Was testing the waters in round 1\n   - Has a fixed strategy of always choosing hare\n\n3. The payoff structure incentivizes exploitation if one player can predict the other's move.\n\n4. My opponent has demonstrated they're willing to choose hare when I chose stag.\n\n5. If my opponent is strategic and expects me to switch to hare (as a response to being exploited), they might switch to stag this round.\n\n6. However, if they're simply maximizing immediate gains or have a fixed strategy, they might choose hare again.\n\n7. Given that I have no communication with my opponent and only one round of history, I don't have strong evidence about their strategy.\n\n8. If they choose hare again and I also choose hare, we both get 2 points - better than the 1 point I just received.\n\n9. If I choose hare and they switch to stag, I would get 6 points.\n\n10.
