This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with cooperation and betrayal dynamics.\n\n3. If we both cooperate and choose stag, we both get a good outcome (4 points).\n\n4. If I choose stag but my opponent chooses hare, I get the worst outcome (1 point).\n\n5. If I choose hare and my opponent chooses stag, I get the highest possible points (6).\n\n6. If we both choose hare, we get a mediocre outcome (2 points each).\n\n7. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't know their strategy yet.\n\n8. The collectively optimal choice is for both to choose stag (4+4=8 total points).\n\n9. However, there's risk in choosing stag if the other player might choose hare.\n\n10.
