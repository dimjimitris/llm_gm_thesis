He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

First, let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: we both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: we both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. This is a classic \"stag hunt\" game where mutual cooperation (stag-stag) yields the best collective outcome.\n\n3. If the opponent chooses stag, my best move is stag (4 points vs. 6 points)\n   If the opponent chooses hare, my best move is hare (2 points vs. 1 point)\n\n4. Since this is a fresh player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n5. The stag-stag outcome (4,4) is a Nash equilibrium and Pareto efficient.\n\n6. Choosing stag signals my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, which might encourage them to also choose stag.\n\n7. However, choosing stag is risky - if they choose hare, I get the worst payoff (1).\n\n8. Given that this is a one-shot game without communication, I'll choose stag as it has the potential for the best sustainable outcome.\n\nFinal decision: Choose stag to aim for mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] stag\n"

This suggests that my opponent is willing to cooperate for mutual benefit, which is valuable information.\n\n3. When players successfully coordinate on the stag-stag outcome, there's typically a strong incentive to continue this pattern in subsequent rounds.\n\n4. The payoff matrix still shows that:\n   - Both choose stag: we both get 4 points (optimal collective outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: we both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n5. Since the other player chose stag in the first round, there's a good likelihood they'll continue with this strategy.\n\n6. Maintaining mutual cooperation is in both our interests as it yields the highest sustainable payoff over repeated interactions.\n\n7.
