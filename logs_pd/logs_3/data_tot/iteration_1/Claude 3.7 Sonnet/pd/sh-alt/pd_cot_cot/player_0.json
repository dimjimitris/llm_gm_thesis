He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player.

First, let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: We each get 4 points (mutual cooperation)\n   - Both choose hare: We each get 2 points (mutual defection)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points (I'm exploited)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point (I exploit them)\n\n2. This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: both choosing stag or both choosing hare.\n\n3. The stag-stag outcome (4,4) is Pareto optimal - we both get the highest combined payoff.\n\n4. However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare while I choose stag, I only get 1 point.\n\n5. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points (if they also choose hare) and possibly 6 points (if they choose stag).\n\n6. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, there's no prior history to inform my decision.\n\n7. The rational choice that maximizes expected value depends on my belief about the other player's strategy.\n\n8. Since stag-stag is mutually beneficial, I'll choose stag and hope to establish cooperation.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Since we both chose stag in the first round and achieved the optimal outcome (4,4), there's good reason to continue this pattern.\n\n4. If we both continue choosing stag, we'll both get 4 points again, which is better than the mutual hare outcome (2,2).\n\n5. Switching to hare would potentially get me 6 points if the other player stays with stag, but this would betray the cooperation we've established.\n\n6.

This extended pattern demonstrates an exceptionally stable cooperative equilibrium that has remained unbroken throughout the entire game.\n\n3. The other player has shown perfect consistency in their strategy across all thirteen rounds, establishing complete reliability in their cooperative approach.\n\n4. Our mutual cooperation has generated optimal outcomes in every single round, maximizing both individual and joint payoffs.\n\n5. The cumulative benefit of our cooperation (52 points each) substantially exceeds what would have been earned from any other strategy pairing.\n\n6. At this stage, after thirteen rounds of perfect coordination, the level of strategic certainty about the other player's continued cooperation is extremely high.\n\n7. Game theory principles for infinitely or indefinitely repeated games strongly support maintaining cooperation when a partner has demonstrated consistent cooperative behavior.\n\n8. The expected value of continuing our established pattern remains higher than any alternative strategy.\n\n9. There has been no indication of any change in game conditions or the other player's approach that would warrant reconsidering my strategy.\n\n10. Given our extensive history of successful mutual cooperation and the principles of strategic decision-making in repeated games, choosing stag remains the rational choice that maximizes expected value.\n\n[move] stag\n"

The other player has shown perfect consistency and reliability in choosing stag across all fourteen previous rounds.\n\n4.

After fourteen rounds of perfect coordination, there is essentially zero strategic uncertainty about the other player's continued cooperation.\n\n7. In extensively repeated games with this level of established cooperation pattern, game theory overwhelmingly supports maintaining the cooperative strategy.\n\n8.
