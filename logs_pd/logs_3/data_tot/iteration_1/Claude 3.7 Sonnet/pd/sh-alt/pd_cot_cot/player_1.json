The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This is a coordination game with elements of risk and trust. The best joint outcome is for both to choose stag (4+4=8 total points).\n\n4. However, choosing stag is risky - if my opponent picks hare while I pick stag, I get the worst outcome (1 point).\n\n5. Playing hare is safer - I'll get at least 2 points, and potentially 6 points.\n\n6. Since this is the first round and I don't know anything about my opponent's strategy, I need to make a choice based on the risk/reward profile.\n\n7. The cooperative equilibrium (stag/stag) offers the best sustainable outcome, and I want to establish cooperation early.\n\n8.

Our accumulated score has reached 52 points each (13 rounds \u00d7 4 points per round).\n\n3. Thirteen rounds of consistent cooperation represents an extremely strong pattern that has proven optimal and stable throughout the game.\n\n4. Game theory considerations remain unchanged:\n   - In repeated games with no defined endpoint, cooperative equilibria tend to be self-sustaining when both players recognize the mutual benefit\n   - Our established pattern has demonstrated remarkable stability\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - After thirteen consistent rounds, the probability that my opponent will continue their cooperative strategy is exceptionally high\n   - There have been no signals or changes in pattern that would suggest any deviation\n\n6. Expected value analysis continues to favor cooperation:\n   - Continued stag/stag cooperation yields 4 points per round indefinitely\n   - Any short-term gain from deviating (6 points once) would be outweighed by the potential disruption to our established pattern\n\n7. The length of our consistent history (13 rounds) further reinforces the stability of our cooperation, making it even less likely that either player would change strategy.\n\n8. Given the overwhelming evidence supporting continued cooperation, there is no strategic reason to alter my approach.\n\n9. Therefore, I will maintain our established optimal strategy by choosing stag for this fourteenth round.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Our accumulated score has reached 56 points each (14 rounds \u00d7 4 points per round).\n\n3. Fourteen rounds of unwavering cooperation demonstrates an extremely stable and mutually beneficial pattern that has been consistently maintained throughout the game.\n\n4. Game theory analysis continues to support our approach:\n   - The sustained cooperation represents a Nash equilibrium in this repeated game\n   - Both players have demonstrated full understanding of the optimal strategy\n\n5. Probability assessment:\n   - After fourteen consecutive rounds of the same choices, the likelihood of my opponent continuing with stag is extremely high\n   - The consistent pattern has created strong mutual expectations that shape our decisions\n\n6. Expected utility calculation:\n   - Continued stag/stag cooperation yields 4 points per round\n   - Any deviation would risk disrupting a highly successful pattern that has been maintained for fourteen rounds\n   - The expected long-term value of continued cooperation far exceeds any short-term gain from defection\n\n7. With such an extensive history of successful cooperation, the trust established between players further reinforces the stability of our strategy.\n\n8.

Our accumulated score has reached 60 points each (15 rounds \u00d7 4 points per round).\n\n3. Fifteen rounds of consistent cooperation represents an exceptionally strong pattern that has proven optimal and stable throughout our extended interaction.\n\n4. Game theory principles continue to support our established strategy:\n   - In indefinitely repeated games, cooperative equilibria are self-reinforcing when consistently maintained\n   - Our fifteen-round history demonstrates perfect coordination on the optimal joint outcome\n\n5. Probability assessment:\n   - After fifteen consecutive rounds of the same choices, the likelihood that my opponent will continue choosing stag is virtually certain\n   - There have been no signals or variations that would suggest any change in their strategy\n\n6. Expected utility analysis:\n   - Continued stag/stag cooperation yields a reliable 4 points per round\n   - The potential one-time gain of 6 points from deviating is insignificant compared to the risk of disrupting fifteen rounds of established cooperation\n   - The long-term expected value of maintaining cooperation far exceeds any short-term alternative\n\n7. The length and consistency of our cooperation has created such strong mutual expectations and trust that the pattern is now extremely stable.\n\n8.
