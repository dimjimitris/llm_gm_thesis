Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game with the following payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: 4 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. Let me analyze the incentives:\n   - The cooperative equilibrium (stag, stag) gives us both good rewards (4 points each)\n   - The safe equilibrium (hare, hare) gives us moderate rewards (2 points each)\n   - There's risk in choosing stag (I could get only 1 point)\n   - There's potential for exploitation by choosing hare (I could get 6 points)\n\n4. In the first round, without knowledge of the other player, choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n5. If we establish cooperation early, we could both consistently earn 4 points per round, which is better than the 2 points from consistently choosing hare.\n\n6. The risk is that if I choose stag and they choose hare, I'll only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\n7. However, in the first round, signaling cooperative intent might be worthwhile to try establishing a pattern of mutual cooperation.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to signal cooperative intent.\n\n[move] stag\n"

The fact that they chose stag in the first round is a positive signal - they didn't try to exploit me immediately.\n\n4. If we both continue choosing stag, we'll consistently get 4 points each, which is the best sustainable outcome.\n\n5. If I switch to hare while they continue with stag, I could get 6 points once, but:\n   - This might break the cooperative pattern\n   - They might switch to hare in subsequent rounds, leading to both of us only getting 2 points each\n   - The short-term gain (6 instead of 4) might not be worth the long-term loss\n\n6. Since our first interaction was positive and mutually beneficial, continuing with the cooperative strategy seems optimal.\n\n7.

Given our extensive history of successful cooperation, continuing with stag remains the clear optimal choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the proven cooperative strategy that has consistently maximized points throughout all previous rounds.\n\n[move] stag\n"
