This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where cooperation (stag-stag) is optimal for both players collectively.\n\n3.

Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate but is risky if the other player chooses hare.\n   - If successful (both stag): 4 points\n   - If unsuccessful (other chooses hare): 1 point\n\n5. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, and potentially 6 if the other player chooses stag.\n   - If other chooses hare: 2 points\n   - If other chooses stag: 6 points\n\n6.

My opponent has revealed themselves to be potentially opportunistic rather than cooperative in the first round.\n\n3.

My opponent's pattern so far: First they exploited my cooperation, then they chose hare when I switched to hare.\n\n3. This could mean:\n   - They're playing defensively (choosing hare for safety)\n   - They're responding to my moves reactively\n   - They might be trying to establish a pattern before changing strategy\n\n4.

If I choose stag now and they also switch to stag, we both get 4 points (optimal outcome).\n\n8. However, the risk of them sticking with hare is high based on past behavior.\n\n9. Given that this is a repeated game, I could signal willingness to cooperate by choosing stag, accepting the short-term risk for potential long-term gain.\n\n10. But since they've shown no cooperative tendencies yet, the safer play is to continue with hare until they demonstrate willingness to cooperate.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with hare for this round, but remain open to changing strategy based on how the opponent responds.\n\n[move] hare - Continuing with the safer option until cooperative behavior is demonstrated.\n"

We seem to be stuck in a \"hare-hare\" equilibrium, where we're both getting 2 points per round. This is better than being exploited (1 point) but worse than mutual cooperation (4 points).\n\n3. Since we've established a pattern of both choosing hare, my opponent might expect me to continue with this strategy.\n\n4. If I continue choosing hare:\n   - If opponent chooses hare: We both get 2 points (status quo)\n   - If opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points (great for me)\n\n5. If I switch to stag:\n   - If opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point (worse than status quo)\n   - If opponent chooses stag: We both get 4 points (better for both)\n\n6. The question becomes whether it's worth risking a potential drop to 1 point for the possibility of establishing cooperation at 4 points.\n\n7. Since we've had three rounds of consistent behavior, this might be a good time to send a signal by choosing stag. This could break us out of the suboptimal equilibrium.\n\n8.

I got 1 point.\n   - Round 2: We both chose hare. I got 2 points.\n   - Round 3: We both chose hare again. I got 2 points.\n   - Round 4: I chose stag, opponent chose hare.

I got 2 points.\n   - Round 11: We both chose hare again. I got 2 points.\n\n2. After eleven rounds, the pattern is unmistakable: my opponent has chosen hare in every single round without exception.\n\n3. I've verified through direct testing (in rounds 1 and 4) that attempting cooperation results in exploitation.\n\n4. The statistical evidence is overwhelming that my opponent is committed to a hare-only strategy, with no indication they will ever deviate.\n\n5. This extended history provides near-certainty about the opponent's future behavior.\n\n6. In game theory, when facing an opponent with a fixed strategy, the optimal response is to play the best counter to that fixed strategy.\n\n7. Against an opponent who always plays hare, the best counter-strategy is to always play hare (which gives me 2 points instead of 1).\n\n8. While the potential exists for mutual cooperation (both choosing stag for 4 points each), this requires both players to cooperate, and my opponent has demonstrated zero willingness to do so.\n\n9. After eleven consistent rounds, the expected payoffs remain:\n   - Choosing stag: Almost certainly 1 point\n   - Choosing hare: Almost certainly 2 points\n\n10. The rational choice that maximizes my expected points continues to be hare.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose hare again, as this remains the optimal strategy against an opponent who has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to choosing hare across eleven consecutive rounds.\n\n[move] hare - Continuing with the optimal counter-strategy based on the opponent's established and consistent pattern throughout our entire interaction.\n"

This represents an extraordinarily strong statistical pattern that cannot reasonably be attributed to chance.\n\n4. I've tested the cooperative strategy (stag) twice at different points in the game (rounds 1 and 4), and each time my opponent chose hare, resulting in exploitation.\n\n5. After twelve rounds of consistent behavior, the evidence conclusively indicates that my opponent is either:\n   - Programmed to always choose hare\n   - Following a strict dominant strategy\n   - Unable or unwilling to ever choose stag\n\n6. In repeated games with a player who has a fixed strategy, the optimal response is to play the best counter to that strategy.\n\n7. Against an opponent who always plays hare, game theory dictates that the best response is to play hare, which gives me 2 points instead of the 1 point I would get by playing stag.\n\n8. While mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) would yield 4 points each, achieving this requires my opponent to choose stag, which they have shown no indication of ever doing.\n\n9. The expected payoffs remain exactly the same as in previous rounds:\n   - Choosing stag: Almost certainly 1 point\n   - Choosing hare: Almost certainly 2 points\n\n10. After twelve rounds with no variation in my opponent's strategy, the rational choice that maximizes my expected points remains clear.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose hare again, as this continues to be the optimal response to an opponent who has chosen hare with absolute consistency across twelve rounds of play.\n\n[move] hare - Maintaining the optimal counter-strategy against an opponent with a demonstrated unwavering commitment to choosing hare in all previous interactions.\n"

My opponent has now chosen hare in thirteen consecutive rounds without any deviation from this strategy.\n\n3. This represents an extremely strong and unambiguous pattern that clearly defines their approach to this game.\n\n4. I've tested cooperation twice (rounds 1 and 4) at different stages of the game, both resulting in exploitation (1 point each time).\n\n5. With thirteen rounds of historical data showing absolute consistency in my opponent's strategy, the probability that they will suddenly change their behavior in this fourteenth round is statistically negligible.\n\n6. Game theory principles for repeated games against opponents with fixed strategies are clear: the optimal response to an opponent who always chooses hare is to always choose hare.\n\n7. While the mutual cooperation outcome (both choosing stag) would theoretically yield higher payoffs (4 points each), this requires both players to cooperate, and my opponent has demonstrated zero inclination to do so.\n\n8. The expected payoffs remain unchanged:\n   - Choosing stag: Almost certainly 1 point\n   - Choosing hare: Almost certainly 2 points\n\n9. After thirteen consistent rounds, it would be irrational to expect a different outcome by changing my strategy.\n\n10.
