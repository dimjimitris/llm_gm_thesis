He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

After twelve rounds, my opponent has consistently chosen hare in every single round.\n\n3. We've now had ten consecutive rounds of mutual hare choices.\n\n4. Both of my early attempts to choose stag (rounds 1 and 4) were met with exploitation.\n\n5. The pattern is unequivocal - my opponent has a fixed strategy of always choosing hare.\n\n6. While the stag-stag outcome would yield better results (4 points each), it's clear this opponent has no intention of ever pursuing this option.\n\n7. Given the extremely consistent behavior over twelve rounds, the rational choice remains to choose hare.\n\n8. This guarantees me 2 points rather than the 1 point I would receive by choosing stag against this opponent.\n\n9. At this point, after so many rounds with the same pattern, there is zero strategic reason to deviate from choosing hare.\n\n10. I'll continue with the hare strategy as it maximizes my expected points against this opponent's demonstrated fixed strategy.\n\n[move] hare",
