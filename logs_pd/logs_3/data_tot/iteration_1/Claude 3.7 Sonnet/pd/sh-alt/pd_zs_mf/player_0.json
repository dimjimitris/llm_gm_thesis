Both hare \u2192 2 points each (mutual defection) for eleven consecutive rounds\n\nWe've now had twelve consecutive rounds of choosing hare, reinforcing this extremely stable pattern. The game remains firmly locked in a suboptimal equilibrium where we consistently earn 2 points each instead of the potential 4 points from mutual cooperation.\n\nAfter such an extensive history of consistent behavior and with my opponent having clearly established their strategy of exploiting cooperation, the optimal response continues to be maintaining the current equilibrium.\n\n[move] hare. I'll continue with the established equilibrium that guarantees 2 points per round, as the game history provides overwhelming evidence that this is the appropriate strategy against this opponent.\n"
