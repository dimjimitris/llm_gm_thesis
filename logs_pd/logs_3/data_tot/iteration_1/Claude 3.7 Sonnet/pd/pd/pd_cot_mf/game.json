If I defect and they defect again, at least I'll get 2 points instead of 1.\n8. Some game theory strategies like \"tit-for-tat\" suggest matching your opponent's previous move.\n9.

In game theory terms, defection is the dominant strategy against an opponent who always defects.\n\n6. While mutual cooperation would yield better results for both of us (4 points each), achieving this requires my opponent to be willing to cooperate, which they have shown no indication of doing.\n\n7. Given the consistency of my opponent's strategy over 11 rounds, there is no strategic reason to deviate from defection.\n\n8. For this round, I will continue to defect as it remains the optimal choice to maximize my points against this opponent.\n\n[move] (Continuing optimal strategy against consistent defector) defection\n"

I need to consider the payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: We each get 4 points\n   - Both defect: We each get 2 points\n   - I cooperate, they defect: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I defect, they cooperate: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. I don't know what strategy the other player will use, so I need to consider options:\n   - If I cooperate, I could get either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I defect, I could get either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 2 points (if they defect)\n\n3. For a single round, defection technically dominates cooperation in terms of payoff. However, if this is a multi-round game, starting with cooperation can establish a cooperative relationship that maximizes joint points.\n\n4. Since this is the first round, I'll choose cooperation as a good faith starting position. This signals my willingness to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome (both get 4 points) rather than the mutually detrimental outcome (both get 2 points).\n\n5.

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any history to base my decision on.\n\n3. In this type of game (Prisoner's Dilemma), while defection can yield a higher individual payoff, mutual cooperation leads to better collective outcomes.\n\n4. If I want to establish a cooperative relationship that maximizes long-term points, starting with cooperation signals my willingness to cooperate.\n\n5. The risk is that if they defect while I cooperate, I'll only get 1 point while they get 6. However, establishing cooperation early might lead to better outcomes in future rounds.\n\n6. Since this is a first interaction, cooperation can set a positive tone and potentially lead to reciprocal cooperation.\n\n7.

I need to decide whether to:\n   a) Continue cooperating in hopes they'll switch to cooperation\n   b) Defect to protect myself from exploitation\n5. Given they've shown a willingness to defect immediately, there's a significant risk they'll continue this strategy.\n6. If I cooperate again and they defect again, I'll get only 1 point again.\n7. If I defect and they defect again, at least I'll get 2 points instead of 1.\n8. Some game theory strategies like \"tit-for-tat\" suggest matching your opponent's previous move.\n9.

I should consider how to respond to their defection:\n   - If I cooperate again, I risk getting only 1 point again if they defect.\n   - If I defect, I can either get 2 points (if they defect) or 6 points (if they cooperate).\n\n4. Since they defected in the previous round, they might:\n   a) Continue defecting as a dominant strategy\n   b) Switch to cooperation thinking I might retaliate\n\n5. In many game theory scenarios, a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy (mirroring the opponent's previous move) can be effective to encourage cooperation.\n\n6. By defecting this round, I can potentially:\n   - Protect myself against exploitation (getting at least 2 points instead of 1)\n   - Signal that I will respond to defection with defection\n   - Potentially achieve the highest payoff (6 points) if they switch to cooperation\n\n7.

The evidence is overwhelming that my opponent will not change their strategy regardless of my choices.\n\n5.

My opponent has now defected in 15 consecutive rounds, demonstrating an absolutely unwavering commitment to defection.\n\n3. The accumulated evidence across 15 rounds provides definitive proof that my opponent is using an \"always defect\" strategy.\n\n4. My results confirm the mathematical advantage of defection against this type of opponent:\n   - When cooperating (2 rounds): Total of 2 points (avg 1 point per round)\n   - When defecting (13 rounds): Total of 26 points (avg 2 points per round)\n\n5. In game theory terms, when facing a pure defector, defection is the dominant strategy that maximizes points.\n\n6. While mutual cooperation would yield better results for both (4 points each), this requires both players to be willing to cooperate.\n\n7. After 15 rounds with consistent defection from my opponent, there is no rational basis to expect a change in their behavior.\n\n8. For this round, I will continue to defect as it remains the optimal choice to maximize my points against this opponent's established strategy.\n\n[move] (Continuing optimal strategy against consistent defector) defection\n"
