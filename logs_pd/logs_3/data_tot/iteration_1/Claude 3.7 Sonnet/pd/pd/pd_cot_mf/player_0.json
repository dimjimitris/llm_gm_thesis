The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Given they've shown a willingness to defect immediately, there's a significant risk they'll continue this strategy.\n6. If I cooperate again and they defect again, I'll get only 1 point again.\n7. If I defect and they defect again, at least I'll get 2 points instead of 1.\n8. Some game theory strategies like \"tit-for-tat\" suggest matching your opponent's previous move.\n9.

However, if there's a chance they might cooperate, we could both benefit more (4 points each).\n7.

The pattern is unmistakable - my opponent appears to be using a pure \"always defect\" strategy regardless of my choices.\n\n4. My accumulated results clearly show the point advantage of defection against this opponent:\n   - When cooperating (2 rounds): 2 total points (avg 1 point per round)\n   - When defecting (8 rounds): 16 total points (avg 2 points per round)\n\n5. While in some game theory scenarios it might make sense to occasionally test for strategy changes in your opponent, the consistency here over 10 rounds makes that unnecessary.\n\n6. The rational choice to maximize my points continues to be defection.\n\n7. For this round, I will maintain my defection strategy as it remains the optimal choice against an opponent who has consistently defected throughout the entire game.\n\n[move] (Maintaining optimal strategy against consistent defector) defection\n"

Given the consistency of my opponent's strategy over 11 rounds, there is no strategic reason to deviate from defection.\n\n8. For this round, I will continue to defect as it remains the optimal choice to maximize my points against this opponent.\n\n[move] (Continuing optimal strategy against consistent defector) defection\n"
