However, mutual cooperation (4 points each) is better than mutual defection (2 points each)\n5. In initial rounds with new players, cooperation can signal willingness to establish mutual trust\n6.

Following a strict tit-for-tat strategy, I would defect again since they defected last round.\n\n5. However, this could lead us into a cycle of mutual defection (2 points each round), which is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation (4 points each).\n\n6.

My opponent's pattern is becoming clearer - they seem to exploit cooperation whenever possible.\n\n3. In the first round they cooperated, but after that, they've consistently defected regardless of my move.\n\n4.

My opponent has now defected in 11 consecutive rounds, with an almost perfect defection record (only cooperating in round 1).\n\n3. We've been in a stable mutual defection equilibrium for the past 4 consecutive rounds.\n\n4. I've tested cooperation three times throughout our interactions, and my opponent has only reciprocated once, at the very beginning.\n\n5. This is an unusually long sequence of prisoner's dilemma interactions, which might indicate we're playing a game with many rounds.\n\n6. In very long games, occasional cooperative gestures can sometimes break deadlock patterns.\n\n7. However, my opponent has shown extraordinary consistency in exploiting cooperative moves.\n\n8. The expected value calculation remains:\n   - If I defect: Almost certainly 2 points (assuming opponent defects)\n   - If I cooperate: Almost certainly 1 point (assuming opponent defects)\n\n9. While mutual cooperation would be ideal (4 points each), there's virtually no evidence my opponent will ever cooperate again.\n\n10. Given all available information, defection remains the rational choice to maximize points.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

We've now completed 13 rounds, with my opponent defecting in 12 of them (all except the first round).\n\n3. We've been locked in mutual defection for 5 consecutive rounds now.\n\n4. This is an exceptionally long series of prisoner's dilemma interactions, which suggests we might be in an extended game.\n\n5. In such extended games, there comes a point where attempting one more cooperation move might be worthwhile, despite the established pattern.\n\n6. Reasons to consider cooperation:\n   - Breaking out of a suboptimal equilibrium (2 points each vs. potential 4 points each)\n   - The remote possibility that my opponent might finally reciprocate after such a long pattern\n\n7. Reasons to continue defecting:\n   - My opponent has consistently defected in 12 consecutive rounds\n   - Every previous attempt at cooperation (rounds 4 and 8) was exploited\n   - The most likely outcome of cooperation is still exploitation (1 point vs. 2 points)\n\n8. While the potential reward of mutual cooperation is tempting, the overwhelming evidence suggests my opponent will not change their strategy.\n\n9. The expected value of defection (2 points) remains higher than the expected value of cooperation (likely 1 point).\n\n10. Therefore, I will continue with defection as the rational choice to maximize points.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

My opponent has now defected in 13 consecutive rounds, with an almost perfect defection record (only cooperating in round 1).\n\n3. We've been in a stable mutual defection equilibrium for the past 6 consecutive rounds.\n\n4. This is an extremely long series of interactions, which is unusual for standard prisoner's dilemma games.\n\n5. At this point, I need to consider whether there's any strategic value in attempting cooperation one more time:\n   - The potential upside: If they cooperate, we each get 4 points instead of 2\n   - The likely downside: Based on 13 rounds of evidence, they'll defect and I'll get 1 point instead of 2\n\n6. I've already tested cooperation periodically (rounds 1, 4, and 8), with consistent exploitation as the result.\n\n7. In game theory, when a player shows such overwhelming consistency in strategy (defecting in 13/14 rounds), the probability of them suddenly changing is extremely low.\n\n8. The consistent pattern suggests my opponent is either programmed to defect or has a firm strategy of defection regardless of my choices.\n\n9. While continued mutual defection is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation, it's the best I can achieve given my opponent's demonstrated strategy.\n\n10. Therefore, defection remains the rational choice to maximize my points in this round.\n\n[move] Defection\n"

We've now completed 15 rounds, with my opponent defecting in 14 consecutive rounds after the initial cooperation.\n\n3. We've established a remarkably stable pattern of mutual defection for 7 consecutive rounds.\n\n4. With 15 rounds completed, this is clearly an extended version of the prisoner's dilemma game.\n\n5. In such lengthy games, considering whether the game might be nearing its conclusion becomes relevant. In finite games, strategies sometimes change near the end.\n\n6. However, there's no indication we're reaching the end, and my opponent has shown extraordinary consistency in their defection strategy.\n\n7. I've tested cooperation three times (rounds 1, 4, and 8) with the same outcome each time after round 1: exploitation.\n\n8. The mathematical expectation remains clear:\n   - If I defect: Almost certainly 2 points (based on 14 rounds of evidence)\n   - If I cooperate: Almost certainly 1 point (based on 14 rounds of evidence)\n\n9. While the principle of occasional testing might suggest trying cooperation again, the overwhelming evidence of my opponent's strategy makes this an irrational choice at this point.\n\n10.

My opponent has now defected in five consecutive rounds, including when I attempted to reestablish cooperation.\n\n3. We appear to be stuck in a mutual defection pattern, which yields 2 points each round.\n\n4. While mutual cooperation (4 points each) would be better, my opponent has shown no willingness to cooperate since the first round.\n\n5. According to game theory, in a finite game with an opponent who consistently defects, defection is the best response.\n\n6. However, there's always a small possibility that my opponent might change their strategy if I signal willingness to cooperate again.\n\n7. The risk of cooperating is losing 1 point instead of getting 2 points if they defect again.\n\n8. The potential reward of cooperating is getting 4 points if they also cooperate.\n\n9. Given their consistent defection pattern through 5 rounds, the probability they'll suddenly cooperate seems very low.\n\n10. Therefore, the expected value of defecting (likely 2 points) exceeds the expected value of cooperating (likely 1 point).\n\n11.

In some versions of repeated prisoner's dilemma, players might change their strategy if the game is known to be nearing its end.\n\n6. However, there's no indication about how many more rounds we'll play, and my opponent has shown remarkable consistency in defecting.\n\n7. The payoff matrix remains the same:\n   - Both cooperate: We each get 4 points\n   - Both defect: We each get 2 points\n   - I cooperate, they defect: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I defect, they cooperate: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n8. Given the extended history of my opponent's behavior, there's overwhelming evidence that they will continue to defect.\n\n9.

In such situations, sometimes an unexpected cooperative move can yield information or potentially break a stalemate.\n\n7. While the most predictable outcome if I cooperate is that I'll be exploited again (1 point instead of 2), there's a small chance my opponent might be reconsidering their strategy after so many rounds of mutual defection.\n\n8.
