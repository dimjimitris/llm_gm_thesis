Round 2: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 1 point for me, 6 for them (I was exploited)\n3. Round 3: Both players defected \u2192 2 points each (mutual punishment)\n\n4. The game history shows a pattern: my opponent initially cooperated, then defected when I continued to cooperate, and then faced mutual defection when I responded with defection.\n\n5. This suggests they might be testing different strategies or responding to incentives. They've experienced both exploitation (6 points) and mutual defection (2 points).\n\n6. The question now is whether my defection in round 3 has sent a clear signal that I won't be repeatedly exploited, potentially encouraging them to return to cooperation.\n\n7. In classic iterated prisoner's dilemma strategy, after punishment via defection, it can be beneficial to offer an \"olive branch\" by returning to cooperation, giving the opponent an opportunity to establish mutual cooperation again.\n\n8. If I cooperate and they cooperate, we both get 4 points (optimal). If I cooperate and they defect again, I get 1 point but clearly learn they're committed to exploitation.\n\n9. Since we're in repeated rounds, attempting to re-establish cooperation has higher long-term value potential than staying in mutual defection (2 points each round).\n\nFinal decision: I'll offer a chance to return to mutual cooperation by cooperating this round.

Given that they've defected in 3 out of 4 rounds (including the last two consecutive opportunities), continued cooperation is unlikely to change their behavior.\n\n6. Mutual defection (2 points each) is preferable to being repeatedly exploited (1 point for me, 6 for them).\n\n7.

After such an extended history, the likelihood that my opponent would suddenly change their approach is virtually zero.\n\n5. In some theoretical game scenarios, making an unexpected move after many rounds might prompt reconsideration of strategy. However, I've already tried cooperation after defection twice with negative results.\n\n6. The risk-reward calculation remains solidly in favor of defection: cooperation would likely result in 1 point (based on opponent's history), while defection guarantees 2 points.\n\n7.

After 11 rounds with such clear behavioral patterns, there's no strategic justification for deviating from the established equilibrium.\n\nFinal decision: I will continue with defection to secure 2 points for this round, as this remains the optimal individual strategy against an opponent who has demonstrated an overwhelming preference for defection throughout the game.\n\n[move] (Continuing proven strategy against persistent defector) defection\n"

My opponent has defected in 11 out of 12 rounds (92% defection rate), showing an exceptionally consistent strategy throughout the game.\n\n4. The extensive history provides overwhelming evidence that my opponent is committed to defection as their dominant strategy.\n\n5. In extraordinarily long games, there might occasionally be value in testing whether patterns have changed, but this would only make sense after many more rounds of stable behavior.\n\n6. I've already tested cooperation twice after experiencing defection (rounds 1 and 4), with my opponent exploiting my cooperation both times.\n\n7. The expected value calculation remains firmly in favor of defection: cooperation would most likely yield just 1 point based on my opponent's established pattern, while defection guarantees 2 points.\n\n8. While mutual cooperation (4 points each) would be ideal, there's no reason to believe my opponent would reciprocate cooperation after such a long history of defection.\n\n9.

The length and stability of this pattern make it extremely unlikely that my opponent would suddenly change their approach after 13 rounds.\n\n5. In game theory, there's a concept of \"super-rationality\" where players might attempt cooperation even when standard game theory would suggest defection. I tested this approach twice (rounds 1 and 4) with negative results.\n\n6. The expected value calculation remains decisively in favor of defection: cooperation would almost certainly yield just 1 point based on my opponent's consistent behavior, while defection guarantees 2 points.\n\n7.
