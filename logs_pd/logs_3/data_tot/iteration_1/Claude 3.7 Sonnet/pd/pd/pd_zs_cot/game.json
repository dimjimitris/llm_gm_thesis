Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both cooperate: We each get 4 points\n   - Both defect: We each get 2 points\n   - I cooperate, they defect: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I defect, they cooperate: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma game. While defecting gives the highest individual reward if the other player cooperates, mutual cooperation leads to better collective outcomes.\n\n3. I'm playing against a fresh player, so I don't have any history to base my decision on.\n\n4. Often a good strategy in repeated prisoner's dilemma games is to start with cooperation to establish goodwill and potentially develop mutual cooperation.\n\n5. If I cooperate first, I risk getting only 1 point if they defect, but I also open the door to a mutually beneficial relationship where we both get 4 points per round.\n\n6. If I defect first, I might get 6 points if they cooperate, but this could establish mistrust and lead to mutual defection (where we only get 2 points each) in future rounds.\n\n7.
