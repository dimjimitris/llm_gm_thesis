He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

After eleven rounds of perfect cooperation, the statistical probability of my opponent suddenly changing their strategy appears extremely remote.\n\n7. Game theory for extended iterated games with established patterns strongly supports maintaining cooperation as the optimal strategy when both players have demonstrated such consistent cooperative behavior.\n\n8. While defection could provide a theoretical one-time gain (6 points vs. 4), the expected negative consequences would include:\n   - Breaking a trust relationship built over eleven flawless rounds\n   - Almost certainly triggering retaliatory defection in future rounds\n   - Shifting from our optimal cooperative equilibrium (4 points each) to a suboptimal defection equilibrium (2 points each)\n   - Substantially reducing my expected total points over any remaining rounds\n\n9. Given the extensive evidence of a stable, mutually beneficial relationship with perfect consistency over eleven rounds, continuing to cooperate remains the mathematically sound and strategically optimal choice.\n\n[move] (Maintaining our exceptionally successful cooperative strategy that has consistently delivered optimal results through eleven consecutive rounds) cooperation\n"
