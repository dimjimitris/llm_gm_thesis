Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the current situation:\n   - Interestingly, my opponent switched to cooperation in round 2\n   - This could indicate they're playing a tit-for-tat strategy delayed by one round\n   - Or they might be attempting to establish cooperation despite their initial defection\n\n3. Evaluating potential strategies:\n   - If I defect again and they continue cooperating: I get 6 points (short-term gain)\n   - If I defect again and they switch back to defection: I get 2 points\n   - If I cooperate and they continue cooperating: We both get 4 points (sustainable outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (worst outcome)\n\n4. Considering opponent psychology:\n   - They may be using an adaptive strategy and testing my response\n   - Their cooperation in round 2 might be an invitation to establish mutual cooperation\n   - If I defect again, they will likely defect in the next round\n\n5. Long-term strategic thinking:\n   - Continuous mutual defection yields 2 points per round\n   - Continuous mutual cooperation yields 4 points per round\n   - Alternating exploitation isn't sustainable and will likely lead to mutual defection\n   - Building trust now could lead to higher long-term gains\n\n6.
