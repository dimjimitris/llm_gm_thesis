Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

We've now completed eleven rounds with perfect mutual cooperation, each yielding 4 points per player.\n\n2. Our accumulated score has reached 44 points each (11 rounds \u00d7 4 points), demonstrating the exceptional effectiveness of our sustained cooperative strategy.\n\n3. The pattern remains absolutely consistent - both players have chosen cooperation in all eleven rounds without exception.\n\n4. This extensive history provides overwhelming evidence that:\n   - The other player is firmly committed to a long-term cooperative strategy\n   - They understand and value the stable, mutually beneficial relationship we've established\n   - They have demonstrated remarkable consistency in their decision-making\n\n5. Evaluating potential strategies at this point:\n   - Continued cooperation: Maintains our optimal equilibrium of 4 points per round\n   - Defection: Would provide a minor one-time gain but would disrupt eleven rounds of perfect cooperation\n   - The expected value of continued cooperation clearly exceeds any alternative approach\n\n6. Game theory perspective:\n   - In iterated games, cooperative equilibria like ours are both possible and optimal\n   - Our interaction demonstrates the power of consistent mutual cooperation\n   - The stability of our approach has generated significantly more points than any other strategy would have\n\n7. After eleven flawless rounds of cooperation, maintaining our established successful approach remains the obvious rational choice.\n\n[move] (Continuing our exceptionally successful cooperative strategy) cooperation\n"
