Looking at the broader pattern, my opponent has now defected in response to my cooperation in several consecutive attempts (rounds 13 and 15). This suggests they may have shifted to a more exploitative strategy overall.\n\nGiven this recent pattern, continuing to cooperate would likely result in continued exploitation. The more prudent choice is to defect, which would either result in mutual defection (2 points each) or potentially 4 points for me if they revert to their earlier pattern of cooperating when I defect.\n\n[move] (Switching back to defection after my cooperative gesture was met with exploitation, suggesting that continued cooperation would be disadvantageous) defection"
