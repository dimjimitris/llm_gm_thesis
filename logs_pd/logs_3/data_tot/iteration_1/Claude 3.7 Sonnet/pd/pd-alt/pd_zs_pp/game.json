Cooperation yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each), but leaves me vulnerable to exploitation (only 1 point if they defect).

This could mean:\n1. They might have been using a more complex strategy than simple alternation\n2. They might have adapted to my strategy\n3. They might return to their alternating pattern now\n\nIf they were truly on an alternating pattern, they should cooperate this round. However, given the break in pattern, I need to be cautious.\n\nSince they have defected more often than cooperated so far, I'll assume they're more likely to defect and will protect myself accordingly.\n\n[move] Defection\n",

They were following a strict alternating strategy (defect-cooperate-defect-cooperate), but in the last round they defected when their pattern would have predicted cooperation.\n\nThis could mean:\n1. They've changed strategies\n2. They're responding to my defection in Round 4\n3. They're trying to be less predictable\n\nBased on their previous behavior, if they're returning to their alternating strategy, they should cooperate in this round.
