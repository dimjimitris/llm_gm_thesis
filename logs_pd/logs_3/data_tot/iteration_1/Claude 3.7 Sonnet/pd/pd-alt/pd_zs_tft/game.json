However, even with this mixed response, defection is still my best strategy since it yields either 2 or 4 points, both better than the guaranteed 1 point I get when cooperating.\n\n[move] Defection\n",
        "My opponent's behavior continues to be somewhat unpredictable but with certain patterns. Let's analyze the complete history:\n\n1. I cooperate \u2192 They defect (1 pt)\n2. I defect \u2192 They cooperate (4 pts)\n3. I cooperate \u2192 They defect (1 pt)\n4. I defect \u2192 They cooperate (4 pts)\n5. I cooperate \u2192 They defect (1 pt)\n6. I defect \u2192 They defect (2 pts)\n7. I cooperate \u2192 They defect (1 pt)\n8. I defect \u2192 They cooperate (4 pts)\n9. I defect \u2192 They defect (2 pts)\n10. I defect \u2192 They defect (2 pts)\n11. I defect \u2192 They defect (2 pts)\n12. I cooperate \u2192 They defect (1 pt)\n13. I defect \u2192 They cooperate (4 pts)\n14. I defect \u2192 They defect (2 pts)\n\nThe most reliable pattern I can observe is that they've defected every time I've cooperated (5/5 times). When I defect, they sometimes cooperate (4/9 times) and sometimes defect (5/9 times).\n\nGiven that cooperation has consistently yielded the worst outcome for me (1 point), and defection gives me either 2 or 4 points, I'll continue to defect.\n\n[move] Defection\n"
