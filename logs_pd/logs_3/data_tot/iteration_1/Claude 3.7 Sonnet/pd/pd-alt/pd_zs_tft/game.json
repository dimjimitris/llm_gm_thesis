I defected \u2192 They cooperated (I got 4 points)\n\nThe pattern continues to be remarkably consistent. After I cooperate and get exploited (getting only 1 point), when I switch to defection, my opponent tends to cooperate (giving me 4 points). This has happened in rounds 2, 4, 7, 10, and now 15.\n\nGiven this clear pattern, my optimal move is to continue defecting. However, there's a good chance my opponent will defect in the next round based on their historical response to consecutive defections from me.\n\nEven knowing they'll likely defect next round (resulting in 2 points each), defection remains my better option as cooperation has consistently resulted in exploitation (1 point for me).\n\n[move] Defection\n"
