Given their observed pattern of behavior, it's likely they're exploiting cooperation strategically rather than genuinely seeking mutual benefit.\n\n15. If I cooperate again, based on their pattern, they're likely to defect again, leaving me with just 1 point.\n\n16. The rational response to their repeated exploitation is to defect, which will either give me 2 points (if they defect) or 4 points (if they cooperate).\n\n17. I'll choose defection this round as protection against further exploitation.\n\n[move] (Responding to opponent's pattern of defecting after cooperation) defection"

Given that we both just defected, they might expect me to continue defecting or try to re-establish cooperation.\n\n15. There's a possibility they might cooperate this round in an attempt to return to mutual cooperation (as they did after round 2).\n\n16.

We've now had two consecutive rounds of mutual defection, which is suboptimal for both of us (2 points each instead of the potential 6 points from mutual cooperation).\n\n13.

In an earlier attempt (round 12), I tried to break this cycle by cooperating, but my opponent exploited this by defecting.\n\n19. However, the game theory concept of \"tit for tat\" suggests that occasional attempts to restore cooperation can sometimes break negative cycles.\n\n20. Given the length of the game, there might be value in making one more attempt to re-establish cooperation, even though it carries risk.\n\n21. If I cooperate and they continue defecting, I'll only get 1 point. But if they also choose to cooperate, we could both get 6 points, which would be significantly better than our current situation.\n\n22. This is a calculated risk, but since we've been locked in mutual defection for several rounds with no sign of change, I'll try cooperation one more time to see if we can break this cycle.\n\n[move] (Taking a calculated risk to try breaking the cycle of mutual defection) cooperation"
