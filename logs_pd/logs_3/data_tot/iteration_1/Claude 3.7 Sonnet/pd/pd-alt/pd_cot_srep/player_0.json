Since we've been locked in mutual defection for two consecutive rounds, there's a possibility my opponent might be willing to break this pattern.\n\n7.

My attempt to break the defection cycle by cooperating failed - the opponent has defected in all four rounds, including when I offered cooperation.\n\n3.

When facing an opponent who consistently defects, game theory tells us the best response is to defect as well.\n\n5. By defecting, I secure 2 points rather than the 1 point I would get by cooperating against a defector.\n\n6.

We've settled into a pattern of mutual defection that gives us both 2 points per round.\n\n5. While this isn't optimal compared to mutual cooperation (6 points each), it's better than being exploited (1 point when I cooperate against defection).\n\n6. Given the opponent's perfect consistency in defecting across all six rounds, there's virtually no evidence to suggest they might change strategy.\n\n7.
