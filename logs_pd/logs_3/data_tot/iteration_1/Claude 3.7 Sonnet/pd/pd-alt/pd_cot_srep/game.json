While this isn't optimal compared to mutual cooperation (6 points each), it's better than being exploited (1 point when I cooperate against defection).\n\n6.

The consistent behavior over multiple rounds indicates a mature understanding of the game's dynamics by both players.\n\n8.

After 7 consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation, my opponent has suddenly defected.\n\n3. This is a major breach of the established cooperative pattern and requires careful consideration of my response.\n\n4. Possible interpretations of this defection:\n   - Opportunistic exploitation after building trust\n   - Testing my response/forgiveness\n   - Beginning of a new strategy\n   - Random deviation\n\n5. If I continue cooperating and they continue defecting, I'll keep getting only 1 point while they get 4.\n\n6. If I defect and they return to cooperation, I'll get 4 points and they'll get 1.\n\n7. If I defect and they also defect, we'll both get 2 points each.\n\n8. Given the sudden betrayal after a long established pattern, the principles of tit-for-tat strategy would suggest defecting in response to signal that exploitation will not be tolerated.\n\n9. This approach balances punishment for defection while allowing a potential return to cooperation if they choose to cooperate again.\n\n10. Continuing to cooperate after their defection might signal that exploitation is acceptable, potentially encouraging continued defection.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will defect in this round to respond to the breach of our cooperative pattern and discourage further exploitation.\n\n[move] (Responding to unexpected defection after established cooperation) defection\n"

This is my first move against a new player, so I have no history to base my decision on.\n\n3. Looking at potential outcomes:\n   - Best collective outcome: mutual cooperation (6+6 = 12 total points)\n   - Worst collective outcome: mutual defection (2+2 = 4 total points)\n   - Unbalanced outcomes: one defects, one cooperates (5 total points)\n\n4. Since this is the first move, I want to encourage cooperation. Starting with cooperation signals willingness to work together for mutual benefit.\n\n5. Although defection could potentially give me 4 points if they cooperate, it risks establishing a pattern of mutual defection which yields fewer points in the long run.\n\n6.

This is the first round against a fresh player, so I have no information about their strategy yet.\n\n3. Looking at the payoffs, mutual cooperation (6 points each) yields the highest total points and is best for both players collectively.\n\n4. However, if I expect the opponent might defect, I should defect to get 2 points instead of just 1.\n\n5. Since this is the first round, it might be beneficial to start with cooperation to potentially establish a cooperative relationship, which would maximize my long-term points if the opponent also cooperates.\n\n6. Starting with cooperation signals willingness to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome, which could encourage the opponent to cooperate in future rounds.\n\n7. The risk of starting with cooperation is minimal (losing 1 point versus potentially gaining 6).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will cooperate in this first round to see if we can establish mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] (I'll start with cooperation to establish mutual trust) cooperation\n",

Given the sudden unexpected defection after a stable cooperative pattern, there's a significant risk they'll defect again.\n\n8. A tit-for-tat strategy would suggest defecting now to respond to their defection, potentially encouraging them to return to cooperation.\n\n9. This approach both protects me from continued exploitation and sends a clear signal that defection will be met with defection.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will defect in this round to respond to their unexpected defection and discourage further exploitation.\n\n[move] (Responding to unexpected defection with defensive move) defection\n",
        "This is a surprising and significant development! I need to carefully reassess my strategy.\n\nSteps:\n1. Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Round 2: We both defected (we both got 2)\n   - Round 3: We both defected (we both got 2)\n   - Round 4: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, they got 4)\n   - Round 5: We both defected (we both got 2)\n   - Round 6: We both defected (we both got 2)\n   - Round 7: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 4, they got 1)\n   - Rounds 8-14: We both cooperated (we both got 6 each round)\n   - Round 15: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1, they got 4)\n\n2. After seven consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation, my opponent has unexpectedly defected.\n\n3. This represents a significant breach of the cooperative relationship we had established.\n\n4. My opponent may have defected for several reasons:\n   - Attempting to gain a short-term advantage (4 points instead of 6)\n   - Testing my response to defection\n   - Planning to end the cooperative period\n   - Employing a more complex strategy\n\n5. I need to consider how to respond:\n   - If I cooperate again and they continue defecting, I'll get only 1 point again\n   - If I defect and they defect, we both get 2 points\n   - If I defect and they return to cooperation, I'll get 4 points\n\n6. Many successful strategies in repeated prisoner's dilemma games use a \"tit-for-tat\" approach - responding to defection with defection to discourage exploitation.\n\n7. By defecting in response to their defection, I signal that I won't tolerate exploitation while still leaving the door open to return to cooperation if they do.\n\n8. Given their defection after a long period of cooperation, a reciprocal defection is the rational response to protect my interests.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will respond to their defection with defection to discourage exploitation while signaling willingness to return to cooperation if they do.\n\n[move] (Responding to opponent's defection with strategic defection) defection\n"
