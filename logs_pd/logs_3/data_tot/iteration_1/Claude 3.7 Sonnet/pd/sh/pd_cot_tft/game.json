First, let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each (cooperative outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (safe but suboptimal)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 points (I'm exploited)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 point (I exploit them)\n\n2. This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare)\n   - The stag-stag outcome is Pareto optimal (best for both players combined)\n   - But choosing stag is risky if the other player might choose hare\n\n3. Key considerations for my first move:\n   - I don't know the other player's tendencies yet\n   - They're described as a \"fresh player\" which suggests no prior history\n   - Without coordination, there's risk in choosing stag\n   - However, the cooperative stag-stag outcome maximizes joint welfare\n\n4. Since this is the first round, I'll opt for cooperation to establish a positive precedent. The stag-stag outcome yields the highest individual and collective reward.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to aim for the optimal cooperative outcome.\n\n[move] stag - I'll choose cooperation hoping for mutual benefit with the highest possible payoff.\n"

Risk assessment:\n   - While the other player could potentially switch to hare (trying to exploit my stag choice), this would be against their own long-term interest\n   - The successful cooperation in round 1 creates an incentive for both of us to continue cooperating\n\n4. Expected value calculation:\n   - If we both continue with stag, we both get 6 points again\n   - If I switch to hare while they stay with stag, I get 4 points but risk breaking cooperation\n   - The cooperative equilibrium (stag, stag) remains the highest value outcome\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with stag to maintain our successful cooperation.\n\n[move] stag - Continuing cooperation after our successful first round.\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
