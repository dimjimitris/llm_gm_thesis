Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: we each get 6 points (best collective outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: we each get 2 points (safe but suboptimal)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 points (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 point (best for me individually)\n3. This is the first round, so I have no prior history with this player to base my decision on.\n4. The \"stag\" choice is risky but offers the highest mutual reward if we both cooperate.\n5. The \"hare\" choice is safer - it guarantees at least 2 points and possibly 4.\n6. Since this is a fresh player with no established trust, there's risk in choosing stag.\n7. However, choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n8. If I want to establish a cooperative relationship, starting with stag might be beneficial.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to establish a cooperative precedent.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Since we've established a precedent of cooperation, continuing with stag seems logical.\n5. By choosing stag again, I maintain the cooperative relationship.\n6. There is still some risk the other player might switch to hare (which would leave me with only 1 point).\n7. However, the potential reward (6 points) from continued mutual cooperation outweighs this risk.\n8. Continued cooperation through multiple rounds leads to the highest cumulative score.\n9. Switching to hare now might break trust and lead to a cycle of mutual hare choices (only 2 points each).\n\nFinal decision: Since we've established successful cooperation, I'll maintain it.\n\n[move] stag\n"

This has consistently yielded the optimal outcome of 6 points per round for each player.\n3. After fourteen rounds of perfect cooperation, the pattern is exceptionally stable and reliable.\n4. The other player has demonstrated remarkable consistency and commitment to the cooperative strategy.\n5. The probability of the other player continuing to choose stag is virtually certain based on this extensive history.\n6. The trust relationship is absolutely solid after fourteen successful cooperative rounds.\n7. In game theory, such a well-established pattern of cooperation in repeated interactions is extremely likely to persist.\n8. Expected value analysis:\n   - Continuing with stag: Expected ~6 points (based on fourteen rounds of history)\n   - Switching to hare: Only 4 points (and risks disrupting an extremely successful pattern)\n9. There remains no strategic advantage to changing a strategy that has been optimal for fourteen consecutive rounds.\n10. The rational decision continues to be maintaining the cooperative strategy.\n\nFinal decision: After fourteen rounds of successful cooperation, continuing with stag remains the clearly optimal choice.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Game theory principles strongly indicate that in repeated games with this level of established cooperation, the pattern is highly likely to continue.\n8.
