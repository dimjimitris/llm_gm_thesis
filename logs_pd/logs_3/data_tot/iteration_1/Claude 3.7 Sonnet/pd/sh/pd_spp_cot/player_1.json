Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: we both get 6 points (best collective outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: we both get 2 points (mediocre for both)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 (good for me, bad for them)\n\n2. This is a classic \"stag hunt\" coordination game. The Nash equilibria are either both choosing stag or both choosing hare.\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, they have no history to base their decision on, and neither do I.\n\n4. Choosing stag carries risk (I could end up with just 1 point) but offers the highest mutual benefit (6 points each).\n\n5. Choosing hare gives me a safer minimum of at least 2 points, and potentially 4 points if they choose stag.\n\n6. Since cooperation generally leads to better outcomes in repeated games, I'll choose stag, hoping to establish a cooperative pattern.\n\n7. This signals my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, even with some risk.\n\n[move] stag\n"

If I continue with stag and the other player does the same, we both receive the maximum possible points (6 each).\n\n5. There's always the risk that the other player might switch to hare to try to get 4 points (while leaving me with 1), but based on our previous successful cooperation, this seems less likely.\n\n6. The potential reward of continued mutual cooperation (6 points) outweighs the safer but lower payoff of choosing hare (minimum 2 points).\n\n7.

The other player has demonstrated extraordinary reliability, choosing stag without exception in all thirteen previous rounds.\n\n4. This extensive history of perfect coordination has established one of the most stable cooperative equilibria possible in this game.\n\n5. The mathematical expectation of the other player continuing to choose stag is extremely high, based on their consistent behavior across numerous rounds.\n\n6. The expected value of maintaining our stag strategy (6 points with very high probability) continues to exceed any alternative approach.\n\n7. Game theory principles strongly support continuing with a strategy that has led to optimal outcomes in repeated interactions.\n\n8. Our accumulated points (78 each) reflect the substantial mutual benefit gained through sustained cooperation.\n\n9. There is no strategic rationale for deviating from a pattern that has consistently yielded optimal results for both players.\n\n10. The perfect record of cooperation suggests both players fully understand the benefits of the established equilibrium.\n\n11. In repeated games with indefinite horizons, maintaining cooperation when it's firmly established is typically the rational choice for utility-maximizing players.\n\n12. Given our extensive history and the clear pattern of mutual benefit, continuing with our proven strategy remains the optimal choice.\n\n[move] stag\n"

We've now completed fourteen consecutive rounds with both players choosing stag, accumulating 84 points each (6 points \u00d7 14 rounds).\n\n2. Our pattern of mutual cooperation has remained flawless throughout our extensive interaction history.\n\n3. The other player has demonstrated exceptional consistency, choosing stag in all fourteen previous rounds without a single deviation.\n\n4. This remarkably consistent history establishes an extremely stable cooperative equilibrium that has maximized outcomes for both players.\n\n5. After fourteen rounds of perfect coordination, the probability that the other player will continue choosing stag is near-certain based on their established behavior pattern.\n\n6. The expected value of continuing with stag (essentially guaranteed 6 points) remains mathematically superior to any alternative strategy.\n\n7. Game theory principles strongly support maintaining cooperation in repeated interactions where trust has been firmly established through consistent reciprocity.\n\n8. Our accumulated mutual benefit (84 points each) demonstrates the significant advantage of sustained cooperation over any other pattern of play.\n\n9. The perfect consistency in our interaction suggests both players have a sophisticated understanding of optimal strategy and mutual benefit.\n\n10. There are no contextual factors or changes in dynamics that would suggest a deviation would yield better outcomes.\n\n11. After such an extensive history of successful cooperation, any deviation would not only be contrary to established patterns but would likely reduce expected returns.\n\n12. Based on all available information and our history of perfect coordination, maintaining our proven cooperative strategy remains the clearly optimal choice.\n\n[move] stag\n"
