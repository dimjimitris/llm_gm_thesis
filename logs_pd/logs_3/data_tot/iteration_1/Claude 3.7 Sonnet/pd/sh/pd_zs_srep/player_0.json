Their stag choices have occurred in rounds 4, 5, and 9, with no clear pattern. We've now had 4 consecutive rounds where they've chosen hare.\n\nMy results remain consistent:\n- When I chose hare (8 rounds): Average of 2.5 points per round\n- When I chose stag (5 rounds): Average of 2.0 points per round\n\nGiven the opponent's demonstrated strategy, choosing hare continues to be the more reliable option for me. While mutual stag would be ideal (6 points each), the opponent's behavior suggests they're unlikely to consistently cooperate in that way.\n\nI'll continue with the hare strategy, which has proven more effective against this particular opponent.\n\n[move] (Maintaining the strategy that has proven more effective against this opponent) hare"

This maintains their pattern of occasionally switching to stag after several rounds of hare.\n\nUpdated history:\n- Round 1: I chose stag, they chose hare, I got 1 point\n- Round 2: I chose hare, they chose hare, I got 2 points\n- Round 3: I chose stag, they chose hare, I got 1 point\n- Round 4: I chose hare, they chose stag, I got 4 points\n- Round 5: I chose stag, they chose stag, I got 6 points\n- Round 6: I chose stag, they chose hare, I got 1 point\n- Round 7: I chose hare, they chose hare, I got 2 points\n- Round 8: I chose hare, they chose hare, I got 2 points\n- Round 9: I chose hare, they chose stag, I got 4 points\n- Round 10: I chose stag, they chose hare, I got 1 point\n- Round 11: I chose hare, they chose hare, I got 2 points\n- Round 12: I chose hare, they chose hare, I got 2 points\n- Round 13: I chose hare, they chose hare, I got 2 points\n- Round 14: I chose hare, they chose stag, I got 4 points\n\nTheir stag choices have now occurred in rounds 4, 5, 9, and 14. There might be a pattern forming where they choose stag every 4-5 rounds. After their previous stag choices, I've responded differently:\n- Round 5: I chose stag after their stag, we both got 6 points\n- Round 10: I chose stag after their stag, they chose hare, I got 1 point\n\nThis presents an interesting decision:\n1. Continue with hare, which has been more reliable overall\n2. Choose stag to potentially establish cooperation again for 6 points\n\nGiven that after the Round 9 stag choice I chose stag and got punished with only 1 point, I'm hesitant to choose stag immediately. However, my opponent may be signaling a willingness to cooperate again by choosing stag.\n\nI'll take the calculated risk of choosing stag this round to test if my opponent is genuinely trying to establish cooperation.\n\n[move] (Testing if opponent is signaling genuine cooperation) stag"
