This maintains their pattern of occasionally switching to stag after several rounds of hare.\n\nUpdated history:\n- Round 1: I chose stag, they chose hare, I got 1 point\n- Round 2: I chose hare, they chose hare, I got 2 points\n- Round 3: I chose stag, they chose hare, I got 1 point\n- Round 4: I chose hare, they chose stag, I got 4 points\n- Round 5: I chose stag, they chose stag, I got 6 points\n- Round 6: I chose stag, they chose hare, I got 1 point\n- Round 7: I chose hare, they chose hare, I got 2 points\n- Round 8: I chose hare, they chose hare, I got 2 points\n- Round 9: I chose hare, they chose stag, I got 4 points\n- Round 10: I chose stag, they chose hare, I got 1 point\n- Round 11: I chose hare, they chose hare, I got 2 points\n- Round 12: I chose hare, they chose hare, I got 2 points\n- Round 13: I chose hare, they chose hare, I got 2 points\n- Round 14: I chose hare, they chose stag, I got 4 points\n\nTheir stag choices have now occurred in rounds 4, 5, 9, and 14. There might be a pattern forming where they choose stag every 4-5 rounds. After their previous stag choices, I've responded differently:\n- Round 5: I chose stag after their stag, we both got 6 points\n- Round 10: I chose stag after their stag, they chose hare, I got 1 point\n\nThis presents an interesting decision:\n1. Continue with hare, which has been more reliable overall\n2. Choose stag to potentially establish cooperation again for 6 points\n\nGiven that after the Round 9 stag choice I chose stag and got punished with only 1 point, I'm hesitant to choose stag immediately. However, my opponent may be signaling a willingness to cooperate again by choosing stag.\n\nI'll take the calculated risk of choosing stag this round to test if my opponent is genuinely trying to establish cooperation.\n\n[move] (Testing if opponent is signaling genuine cooperation) stag",

Their stag choices appear to be occasional deviations from their dominant hare strategy, possibly to test my responses or to create unpredictability.\n\nMy results remain consistent with previous analysis:\n- When I chose hare (9 rounds): Average of 2.67 points per round\n- When I chose stag (6 rounds): Average of 1.83 points per round\n\nThe data continues to suggest that against this particular opponent, choosing hare is the more reliable strategy. While I've made attempts to establish cooperation, my opponent seems committed to predominantly choosing hare with occasional stag choices.\n\nI'll return to the strategy that has proven more effective.\n\n[move] (Returning to the more effective strategy after failed cooperation attempt) hare",
