He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: we both get 6 points (best collaborative outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: we both get 2 points (mediocre collaborative outcome)\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 (I lose badly)\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 (I win at their expense)\n\n2. This is a classic \"stag hunt\" game where mutual cooperation (stag-stag) is the best collective outcome.\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I don't have any history to base my decision on.\n\n4. The stag-stag outcome (6 points each) is clearly the best total outcome and best individual outcome.\n\n5. However, choosing stag is risky - if my opponent chooses hare, I get the worst possible outcome (1 point).\n\n6. Choosing hare guarantees me at least 2 points and possibly 4 points, making it a \"safer\" choice.\n\n7. Since this is the first round, there's value in signaling a willingness to cooperate, which might establish mutual cooperation for future rounds (if we play multiple rounds).\n\n8. The best long-term strategy in such games often involves starting with cooperation (stag) to encourage mutual cooperation.\n\n9. I'll choose stag as my opening move to signal cooperation and aim for the optimal outcome.\n\n[move] stag - I'm choosing cooperation to try to establish mutual benefit.\n"

Since my opponent cooperated in the first round by choosing stag, they've signaled a willingness to pursue the optimal mutual outcome.\n\n4.
