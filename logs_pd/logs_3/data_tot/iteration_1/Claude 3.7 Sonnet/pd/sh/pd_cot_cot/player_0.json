Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a classic stag hunt game where cooperation (both choosing stag) yields the highest collective outcome.\n2. Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each (12 total)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (4 total)\n   - One chooses stag, one chooses hare: 1 point for stag chooser, 4 points for hare chooser (5 total)\n3. The stag option is riskier but has higher reward potential if both players cooperate.\n4. The hare option is safer as it guarantees at least 2 points, and possibly 4 if the other player chooses stag.\n5. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, there's no history to base my decision on.\n6. In the first round, it's reasonable to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n7. Choosing stag demonstrates that intention and could establish a cooperative pattern.\n8. If the other player also reasons this way, we both maximize our points.\n\nFinal decision: I should choose stag to aim for the highest possible payoff through cooperation.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Expected utility calculations continue to strongly favor stag:\n   - Expected points from choosing stag: 6 points\n   - Expected points from switching to hare: at most 4 points, with potential disruption of beneficial pattern\n6. The consistency across thirteen rounds demonstrates both players have:\n   - Full understanding of the game mechanics\n   - Recognition of the optimal cooperative strategy\n   - Commitment to maximizing mutual benefit\n7. With such an extensive history of successful coordination, there remains no rational basis for changing strategies.\n8. In the absence of any new information or changes to the game structure, maintaining the established optimal strategy is clearly the best choice.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose stag again to continue our established pattern of mutual cooperation and optimal scoring.\n\n[move] stag\n"
