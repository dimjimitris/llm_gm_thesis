Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1\n\n2. This is a classic stag hunt game. The cooperative equilibrium (both stag) gives the highest mutual benefit, but requires coordination.\n\n3. If I expect the other player to choose stag, my best response is stag (6 points vs 4 points).\n\n4. If I expect the other player to choose hare, my best response is hare (2 points vs 1 point).\n\n5. Since this is a fresh player with no established history, I don't have information about their typical behavior.\n\n6. The cooperative equilibrium (both stag) would be mutually beneficial, yielding the highest possible points for both players.\n\n7. However, choosing stag is riskier as it could result in only 1 point if the other player chooses hare.\n\n8. Since this is the first round and establishing cooperation might be beneficial for future interactions, I'll choose stag as a signal of willingness to cooperate.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag, hoping to establish a cooperative dynamic.\n\n[move] stag\n"

Let me review the payoff structure again:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (suboptimal mutual outcome)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 (I'm exploited)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 (I exploit them)\n\n4.

This extensive history provides overwhelming evidence that:\n   - Both players are fully committed to the cooperative strategy\n   - The mutual understanding of optimal play is robust\n   - The pattern is stable and beneficial to both players\n\n5. The game theory principles continue to strongly support maintaining our strategy:\n   - Mutual stag choices: 6 points each (optimal and our established pattern)\n   - Any deviation: Would interrupt a proven successful approach with no strategic benefit\n   - Expected behavior: Given 12 rounds of consistency, the other player is extremely likely to choose stag again\n\n6. At this advanced stage in our repeated interactions:\n   - The cooperative norm is firmly established\n   - There would be no rational reason to deviate\n   - Maximum point accumulation continues to result from mutual stag choices\n\n7. Mathematically, the expected value of choosing stag remains significantly higher than choosing hare, given the established pattern.\n\n8.
