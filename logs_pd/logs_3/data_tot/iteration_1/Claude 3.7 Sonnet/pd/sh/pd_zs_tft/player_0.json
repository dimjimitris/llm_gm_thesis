You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

We've now maintained the cooperative stag-stag equilibrium for ten consecutive rounds, with each of us earning the maximum 6 points per round.\n\nUpdated game history:\n- Round 1: I played stag, they played hare (I got 1 point)\n- Round 2: I played hare, they played stag (I got 4 points)\n- Round 3: I played stag, they played hare (I got 1 point)\n- Round 4: I played hare, they played stag (I got 4 points)\n- Round 5: I played stag, they played hare (I got 1 point)\n- Round 6-15: I played stag, they played stag (I got 6 points each round)\n\nOur interaction shows a remarkably stable pattern of cooperation. After the initial five rounds of strategic exploration, we've established a robust cooperative equilibrium that has persisted for ten consecutive rounds. This demonstrates strong mutual trust and understanding of the game's optimal outcome.\n\nGiven our consistent history of mutual cooperation, I will continue with this optimal strategy:\n\n[move] stag\n"
