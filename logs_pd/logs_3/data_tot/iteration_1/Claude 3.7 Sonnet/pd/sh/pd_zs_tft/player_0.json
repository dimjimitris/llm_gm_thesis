This is a stable Nash equilibrium in this game, though not the optimal outcome that could be achieved through cooperation.\n\nMy opponent has shown a strong tendency to exploit cooperation attempts (playing hare when I play stag), and we've settled into a consistent pattern. I see no strategic reason to deviate from this established equilibrium, especially since previous attempts at cooperation were consistently exploited.\n\n[move] hare Continuing with the established strategy that has provided consistent results over multiple rounds.\n"

There's no indication they would change this behavior now, making hare the rational choice to maintain the current equilibrium.\n\n[move] hare Maintaining the established equilibrium strategy that has been consistent over many rounds.\n"
