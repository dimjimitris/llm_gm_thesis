    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Game Theorist - for analyzing the game structure and optimal strategies\n2. Strategic Planner - for long-term planning\n3. Behavioral Psychologist - to understand opponent psychology\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic coordination game called the Stag Hunt. Looking at the payoff matrix:\n- (Stag, Stag): (6, 6) - Pareto optimal outcome\n- (Hare, Hare): (2, 2) - Risk-dominant outcome\n- (Stag, Hare): (1, 4)\n- (Hare, Stag): (4, 1)\n\nThere are two Nash equilibria: both choosing Stag or both choosing Hare. The Stag-Stag equilibrium has higher payoffs for both players but requires trust/coordination. The Hare-Hare equilibrium is safer but yields lower rewards.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first round and we're playing against a fresh player, I think it's strategic to aim for the cooperative equilibrium. By choosing Stag, we signal our intention to cooperate for mutual benefit. If the opponent also chooses Stag, we both maximize our points. There's risk, but the potential reward is highest.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree with aiming for cooperation initially. Many players in these games start with cooperative moves to establish positive relations. However, we should be prepared to adjust our strategy based on the opponent's behavior in subsequent rounds. If they exploit our cooperation by choosing Hare, we might need to reconsider.\n\nGame Theorist: One important note: in a one-shot game, Hare might be safer since it guarantees at least 2 points. But if this is potentially a repeated game, signaling willingness to cooperate with Stag in the first round can establish a beneficial pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's go with Stag for this first round. It maximizes our potential gain and signals cooperative intent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Stag\n"

Both players chose Stag in the first round, resulting in the Pareto optimal outcome with 6 points each. This suggests our opponent is also willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is a promising sign. The opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior, which increases the likelihood they'll continue cooperating. In repeated games, players often develop patterns of mutual cooperation once trust is established.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the successful coordination in round one, continuing with Stag seems optimal. The opponent has shown willingness to cooperate, and maintaining this equilibrium benefits both players. There's always the risk they might defect to Hare, but based on their previous behavior, cooperation seems more likely.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. In repeated games, the most beneficial strategy is often to continue cooperation as long as the other player cooperates, which is what we're seeing. The expected value of continued cooperation (6 points per round) far exceeds the alternatives.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: One thing to consider is that some players might test the waters by occasionally defecting. However, at this early stage with only one positive interaction, the most reasonable prediction is continued cooperation.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's continue with Stag. If the opponent later switches to Hare, we can reassess, but for now, mutual cooperation appears to be the established pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Stag\n"

This is very positive - we're achieving the maximum possible points per round (6).\n\nStrategic Planner: The pattern is clear. Our opponent seems committed to the cooperative strategy, which aligns perfectly with our interests. Continuing with Stag maintains the optimal equilibrium for both players.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Two rounds of mutual cooperation significantly increases trust. The psychological principle of reciprocity suggests the opponent will likely continue this beneficial pattern. There's little incentive for either player to deviate from a strategy that's working so well.\n\nGame Theorist: Mathematically speaking, maintaining the Stag-Stag equilibrium is optimal as long as both players continue to trust each other. We've established a cooperative norm, and in repeated games, such norms tend to be self-reinforcing.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's maintain our Stag strategy. The consistent cooperation suggests we're in a stable pattern that maximizes outcomes for both players.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The only reason to deviate would be if we suspected the opponent might change their strategy, but there's no indication of that based on the consistent behavior so far.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Stag\n"

There's no strategic reason to deviate from our Stag strategy when it's consistently yielding optimal results. We've accumulated 18 points across three rounds by maintaining this cooperation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Three rounds of consistent behavior establishes a very strong precedent. The opponent appears to understand the benefit of cooperation and seems committed to maximizing joint outcomes. At this point, the trust level should be quite high.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory terms, we're seeing what's called a \"cooperative norm\" emerge. When both players recognize that cooperation yields the highest joint payoff, and both consistently act accordingly, this becomes a self-reinforcing equilibrium.\n\nStrategic Planner: I see no reason to change our strategy. Continuing with Stag maintains the optimal outcome for both players.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed.
