The opponent's switch to stag in round 11 was indeed a signal toward cooperation\n5. My response to choose stag in round 12 has led to the optimal outcome - mutual cooperation with 6 points each\n6. We've now established a potentially stable cooperative equilibrium\n7. This outcome is significantly better for both of us than the previous hare-hare equilibrium (6 points vs 2 points each)\n8. The question now is whether this cooperation will continue\n9. Given that the opponent initiated this move toward cooperation, they likely understand the benefits\n10. It's in both our interests to maintain this cooperative equilibrium\n11. The best strategy now is to continue choosing stag to reinforce this mutually beneficial arrangement\n12. If I were to defect to hare, I might gain 4 points once, but would likely destroy the cooperation and return us to the suboptimal equilibrium\n\nFinal decision: I will continue choosing stag to maintain the newly established cooperative equilibrium that benefits both players maximally.\n\n[move] (Maintaining our mutually beneficial cooperative equilibrium) stag\n"

Round 13: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1 point, they got 4)\n\n5. After a brief period of cooperation, my opponent has reverted to choosing hare\n6. This suggests they may have been attempting to exploit my willingness to cooperate\n7. The pattern now appears to be:\n   - They initially played consistently hare\n   - They briefly switched to stag, possibly to entice me to choose stag\n   - Once I chose stag, they exploited this by switching back to hare\n\n8. This behavior suggests a strategic player who is trying to maximize their own points rather than establish consistent cooperation\n9. Given this pattern, I need to protect myself from further exploitation\n10. If I continue choosing stag and they continue choosing hare, I will consistently get only 1 point\n11. Switching back to hare guarantees me at least 2 points if they also choose hare\n12. And if they choose stag again (trying to restart cooperation), I would get 4 points\n\nFinal decision: I will switch back to choosing hare to protect myself from exploitation.

The pattern now appears more complex:\n   - Long initial period of consistent hare choices\n   - Brief attempt at cooperation in rounds 11-12\n   - Return to non-cooperation in rounds 13-14\n\n7. This suggests my opponent might be using a complex strategy, possibly:\n   - Testing my responsiveness to cooperation signals\n   - Trying to establish patterns to predict my moves\n   - Opportunistically maximizing their points\n\n8. Given their unpredictability, I need a strategy that minimizes my risk\n9. When I choose stag, I risk getting only 1 point if they choose hare\n10. When I choose hare, I'm guaranteed at least 2 points if they choose hare\n11. Their behavior has been inconsistent enough that I cannot trust them to cooperate reliably\n12. While the stag-stag outcome (6 points each) is optimal, it requires consistent trust\n13. Since trust has been broken, the safer strategy is to choose hare\n\nFinal decision: I will continue with hare as my choice. This protects me from exploitation while we re-establish a pattern.

Round 15: We both chose hare (continued suboptimal equilibrium, 2 points each)\n\n7. The brief cooperation attempt in rounds 11-12 appears to have been temporary\n8. My opponent has now returned to choosing hare consistently for the last two rounds\n9. This suggests that either:\n   a) They were testing my responsiveness to cooperation and exploitation\n   b) They were attempting to increase their points by enticing me to choose stag and then exploiting that\n   c) They themselves were experimenting with different strategies\n\n10. Given their return to the hare strategy, the safest play continues to be choosing hare\n11. This guarantees me 2 points if they choose hare, which appears most likely\n12. Attempting cooperation again by choosing stag carries significant risk of exploitation\n13. While mutual cooperation would yield 6 points each, their inconsistency suggests they might exploit cooperation\n14. Until there's a more consistent signal of willingness to cooperate, maintaining hare is the rational choice\n\nFinal decision: I will continue to choose hare.
