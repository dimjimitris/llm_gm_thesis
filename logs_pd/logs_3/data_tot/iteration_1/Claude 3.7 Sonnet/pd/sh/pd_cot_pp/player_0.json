Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory, where cooperation (both choosing stag) leads to the highest mutual benefit.\n2. I need to decide whether to pursue the higher risk/higher reward option (stag) or the safer but lower reward option (hare).\n3. The payoff matrix shows:\n   - Both choose stag: 6 points each (best collective outcome)\n   - Both choose hare: 2 points each (suboptimal but safe)\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 (worst for me)\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, they get 1 (best for me individually)\n4. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, there's no history to base my decision on.\n5. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit (6 points each).\n6. While choosing hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points), it limits potential gain.\n7. In the absence of prior information, starting with a cooperative move often establishes a positive dynamic.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for the best mutual outcome.\n\n[move] stag\n"

If I choose hare and they choose stag (switching strategies), I'd get 4 points (best for me).\n7. Since my opponent has already shown non-cooperative behavior, they're likely to continue with hare.\n8. The rational response to a non-cooperative player is to also play non-cooperatively.\n9.

There might be an alternating pattern in their strategy:\n   - They go hare, stag, hare, stag, ...\n   - If this pattern continues, they would choose hare this round\n\n4.

Based on this pattern, they should choose hare in this round.\n\n4. If they choose hare and I choose hare, we both get 2 points.\n   \n5. If they choose hare and I choose stag, I get only 1 point (worst outcome).\n\n6. I've noticed that when I correctly anticipate their move, I've been able to maximize my points:\n   - When they play stag, choosing stag gives me 6 points (rounds 8, 10)\n   - When they play hare, choosing hare gives me 2 points (rounds 3, 7, 9)\n\n7. The alternating pattern has been extremely reliable so far, giving me high confidence in predicting their next move.\n\n8. Given that I predict they'll choose hare this round, choosing stag would likely result in the worst outcome for me (1 point).\n\n9. Even though we've established mutual cooperation in rounds 8 and 10, their strict adherence to the alternating pattern suggests they'll revert to hare regardless.\n\n10. The safest and most rational choice is to respond to their predicted hare move with hare.\n\nFinal decision: Based on the opponent's unwavering alternating pattern throughout the game, I'll choose hare for this round.\n\n[move] hare\n"

This pattern has remained consistent through all 11 rounds without a single deviation.\n\n4. If this pattern continues, they will choose stag in this round.\n\n5. My strategy has evolved to match their pattern:\n   - When they play stag (even-numbered rounds), I've learned to play stag for 6 points (rounds 8, 10)\n   - When they play hare (odd-numbered rounds), I play hare for 2 points (rounds 3, 7, 9, 11)\n\n6. This approach has worked well for me in recent rounds, allowing me to maximize points based on their predictable behavior.\n\n7. Since this is round 12 (an even number), their pattern suggests they'll play stag.\n\n8. If they play stag and I play stag, we both get 6 points (optimal mutual outcome).\n\n9. If they play stag and I play hare, I get 4 points.\n\n10. While choosing hare would be safer (guaranteeing at least 2 points), their pattern has been so reliable that the risk is minimal.\n\n11. Choosing stag allows us to continue the pattern of mutual cooperation in even-numbered rounds, which yields the highest possible points (6).\n\nFinal decision: Based on the opponent's extremely consistent alternating pattern and our successful cooperation in previous even-numbered rounds, I'll choose stag.\n\n[move] stag\n"
