If both players choose stag, we both get the highest collective outcome (6 points each). However, choosing stag is risky because if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, making it the safer option.\n\nSince this is the first round against a fresh player, and there's no history to base decisions on, I'll choose the cooperative option which has the potential for the highest mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag\n"
