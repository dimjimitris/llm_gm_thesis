If both of us choose stag, we'd both get 6 points - the optimal outcome.\n\nI'll take this calculated risk for potential mutual benefit:\n\n[move] stag\n",
        "We both chose hare this round, resulting in 2 points each. This is now the third time we've both chosen hare in this game.\n\nMy point totals so far: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 43 points across fifteen rounds.\n\nLooking at the pattern that's been established:\n- When we both choose hare, the next round often results in both choosing stag (happened twice before)\n- Round 5: Both hare \u2192 Round 6: Both stag\n- Round 11: Both hare \u2192 Round 12: Both stag\n\nThis suggests there might be a tendency for both of us to try cooperation after mutual defection. If this pattern holds, there's a good chance my opponent will choose stag this round.\n\nAdditionally, the mutual stag outcome (6 points each) is the best possible result, so it's worth attempting to achieve it again.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n[move] stag\n",

If I also choose stag, we could achieve the optimal outcome of 6 points each again.\n\nWhile choosing hare has been more reliable overall, the potential for 6 points through mutual cooperation is worth the calculated risk, especially given the pattern we've established after mutual hare choices.\n\n[move] stag\n"
