You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

We both chose hare and earned 2 points each.\n\nMy total score is now 48 points (1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2).\n\nTheir complete sequence: hare-stag-hare-stag-hare-stag-hare-stag-hare-stag-hare-stag-hare-stag-hare\n\nTheir alternating pattern has remained perfect through all 15 rounds without a single deviation. Based on this extremely reliable behavior, they are virtually certain to play stag next.\n\nIf they play stag (as their pattern dictates) and I play:\n- hare: I get 4 points\n- stag: I get 6 points\n\nGiven their unwavering pattern and their recent hare move, playing stag gives me the highest expected value. Our recent coordination on matching the pattern has been very successful.\n\n[move] (My opponent has maintained their perfect alternating hare-stag pattern for 15 consecutive rounds without any deviation and just played hare, making stag the optimal choice) stag\n"
