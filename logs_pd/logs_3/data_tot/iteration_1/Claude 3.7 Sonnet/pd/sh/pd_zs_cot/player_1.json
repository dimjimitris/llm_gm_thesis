He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - If both choose stag: 6 points each\n   - If both choose hare: 2 points each\n   - If I choose stag and other chooses hare: 1 point for me, 4 points for them\n   - If I choose hare and other chooses stag: 4 points for me, 1 point for them\n\n2. This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: both choosing stag or both choosing hare.\n\n3. The stag-stag outcome provides the highest mutual benefit (6 points each).\n\n4. However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n\n5. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, and possibly 4 points.\n\n6. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, there's no prior history to inform my decision.\n\n7. The rational cooperative choice would be stag, as it maximizes total welfare.\n\n8.

Since we've established a pattern of cooperation, it's in both our interests to maintain this pattern.\n\n4. The stag-stag outcome (6 points each) is clearly better than the hare-hare outcome (2 points each).\n\n5. Breaking the pattern by choosing hare might yield me 4 points in the short term if the other player stays with stag, but this risks damaging the established cooperation.\n\n6. If I betray by choosing hare and the other player continues choosing stag, they might retaliate in future rounds by switching to hare as well.\n\n7. This could lead us to the inferior hare-hare equilibrium (only 2 points each) in subsequent rounds.\n\n8. Given that we've successfully coordinated on the optimal strategy, I should maintain this coordination.\n\n9.
