You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

        "I'll analyze this game, which is a version of the classic \"Stag Hunt\" game in game theory.\n\nLet me consider the payoff matrix:\n- Stag-Stag: 6 points each (optimal cooperation)\n- Hare-Hare: 2 points each (suboptimal outcome)\n- Stag-Hare: 1 point for Stag chooser, 4 points for Hare chooser\n- Hare-Stag: 4 points for Hare chooser, 1 point for Stag chooser\n\nThe stag choice offers the highest mutual benefit (6 points) but carries risk if the other player chooses hare (only 1 point). Choosing hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) and could yield 4 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\nSince this is the first round with a new player, cooperation might be possible. The optimal outcome would be if we both choose stag.\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing stag to aim for the optimal cooperative outcome where we both get 6 points.\n",
        "I'll analyze this stag hunt game. The payoff matrix is:\n\nIf both choose stag: 6 points each\nIf both choose hare: 2 points each\nIf one chooses stag, other chooses hare: 1 point for stag, 4 points for hare\n\nThis is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: both choosing stag (payoff-dominant) and both choosing hare (risk-dominant). \n\nChoosing stag has higher potential reward (6 points) but is risky if the other player doesn't cooperate. Choosing hare provides a safer but lower payoff.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I'll choose stag to aim for the optimal mutual outcome.\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing stag to aim for mutual benefit and the highest possible payoff for both of us. While this choice requires trust, it leads to the best outcome (6 points each) if we both cooperate.\n",
