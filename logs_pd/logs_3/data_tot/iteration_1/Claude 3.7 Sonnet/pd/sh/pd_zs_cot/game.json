This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: both choosing stag or both choosing hare.\n\n3. The stag-stag outcome provides the highest mutual benefit (6 points each).\n\n4. However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point.\n\n5. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, and possibly 4 points.\n\n6. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, there's no prior history to inform my decision.\n\n7. The rational cooperative choice would be stag, as it maximizes total welfare.\n\n8.

Breaking the pattern by choosing hare might yield me 4 points in the short term if the other player stays with stag, but this risks damaging the established cooperation.\n\n6. If I betray by choosing hare and the other player continues choosing stag, they might retaliate in future rounds by switching to hare as well.\n\n7. This could lead us to the inferior hare-hare equilibrium (only 2 points each) in subsequent rounds.\n\n8. Given that we've successfully coordinated on the optimal strategy, I should maintain this coordination.\n\n9.
