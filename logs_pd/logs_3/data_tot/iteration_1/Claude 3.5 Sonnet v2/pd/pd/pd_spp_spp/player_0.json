    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding player psychology and behavior patterns\n3. Strategic Advisor - For practical decision-making and risk assessment\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: From a game theory perspective, this is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario. The Nash equilibrium is mutual defection, but that's not necessarily optimal. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, establishing a cooperative tone could be beneficial for long-term gains.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. First impressions are crucial in establishing trust. Research shows that starting with cooperation often encourages reciprocity. However, we should be prepared for either response from the opponent.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Looking at the payoff matrix, while defection could give us 6 points if the opponent cooperates, it risks establishing a negative pattern. Cooperation offers a balanced reward of 4 points if reciprocated, and even if we get exploited (1 point), it sends a positive signal for future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: The risk-reward ratio favors cooperation in the first round. If exploited, we can adjust our strategy, but starting with defection limits our potential for establishing mutual cooperation.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's proceed with cooperation as our opening move. It demonstrates good faith and maximizes potential for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate as an opening move to establish trust and encourage mutual benefit.\n"

The psychology of reciprocity suggests that following up cooperation with cooperation is a strong strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The opponent's cooperation in round 1 is a positive signal. While there's always a risk they might switch to defection to exploit our trust, maintaining cooperation after a successful mutual cooperation round is typically the most rewarding strategy.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior, and we received the optimal mutual benefit of 4 points. Switching to defection now would likely damage the trust we've built and could lead to a cycle of mutual defection (yielding only 2 points each). Let's maintain the cooperative strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: From a game theory perspective, when both players have demonstrated willingness to cooperate, maintaining that equilibrium is usually the most profitable long-term strategy. The potential short-term gain from defection (6 points) isn't worth risking the established cooperative relationship.\n\n[move] (Maintaining cooperation to build on established mutual trust) cooperation\n"

At this point, the psychological cost of betraying this trust would be high, and could irreversibly damage the cooperative dynamic we've established.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Our strategy is working perfectly. We're achieving the highest sustainable point value (4 points per round) through mutual cooperation. While defection might offer a one-time gain of 6 points, it would likely trigger retaliatory defection in future rounds, leading to worse outcomes overall. \n\nGame Theorist: The stability of this cooperative equilibrium is valuable.
