You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Mutual stag choice (6,6) gives the highest combined and individual payoff\n- However, choosing stag is risky since if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4\n- Choosing hare is safer since it guarantees at least 2 points, and could get 4 points if the other picks stag\n\nWhile hare is the safer choice, I think it's worth trying to establish cooperative behavior from the start by choosing stag. This signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to aim for mutual cooperation and maximum payoff for both players\n"
