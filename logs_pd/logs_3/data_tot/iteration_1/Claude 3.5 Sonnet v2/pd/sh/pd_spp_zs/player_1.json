This is a coordination game similar to the Stag Hunt, where mutual cooperation (stag) yields the highest joint payoff, but choosing stag is risky if the other player chooses hare.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player and it's the first move, I want to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. Choosing stag could lead to the best outcome (6 points) if the other player also chooses stag. While there's a risk of getting only 1 point if they choose hare, I think it's worth taking this risk to establish a cooperative dynamic.\n\n[move] Choosing stag to aim for mutual cooperation and maximum benefit\n"
