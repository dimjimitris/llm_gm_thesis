    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Strategic Advisor - For developing winning strategies\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n4. AI Assistant (me) - For making final decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The payoff matrix shows two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The stag-stag combination yields the highest mutual payoff (6,6), making it the payoff-dominant equilibrium. However, choosing hare is less risky since it guarantees at least 2 points.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since we're playing against a fresh player, they might not have developed any strategic preferences yet. The stag strategy offers the highest potential reward if both players cooperate. This could set a positive tone for future interactions.\n\nRisk Analyst: While stag offers the highest potential reward (6 points), it also carries the risk of getting only 1 point if the other player chooses hare. Hare guarantees at minimum 2 points and could yield 4 points. However, consistently choosing hare limits our maximum potential gain.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this is the first move, I suggest choosing stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. If the other player responds negatively, we can adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree. Starting with stag shows good faith and could establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, which would be most beneficial in the long run.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on the analysis, I'll choose stag to aim for the optimal outcome while signaling cooperative intent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag\n"

This suggests our opponent is also willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Advisor: This is a very positive development. The other player has demonstrated cooperative behavior, suggesting they understand the benefits of mutual cooperation. Given this successful interaction, maintaining the stag strategy would be logical to continue the beneficial partnership.\n\nRisk Analyst: While there's always a risk the other player might switch to hare to try to gain a short-term advantage (4 points), their initial cooperative choice suggests they understand the value of sustained mutual cooperation. The risk of them defecting seems lower given the successful first round.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I strongly recommend sticking with stag. Switching to hare now could break the trust we've established and potentially lead to a less optimal equilibrium of mutual hare choices (2,2) in future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Game theory suggests that when players have established a cooperative equilibrium, maintaining it is typically the best strategy unless there are clear signals suggesting otherwise.\n\nAI Assistant: The unanimous recommendation is clear. Given the successful cooperation in the first round, I'll maintain the stag strategy to continue the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag\n"

There's no strategic reason to deviate from what's working so well. Changing our strategy now would only reduce our potential points and potentially break the trust we've built.\n\nRisk Analyst: After two rounds of successful cooperation, the risk assessment actually improves. The other player has demonstrated consistent rational behavior by choosing the mutually beneficial option twice. The risk of them suddenly switching to hare seems even lower now, as they would have more to lose by breaking an established pattern of cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: In repeated games, when players consistently choose the payoff-dominant equilibrium, it tends to become self-reinforcing. Both players recognize the mutual benefit and have little incentive to deviate.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Definitely maintain the stag strategy. We're in an optimal situation with maximum points per round. Any change would be suboptimal.\n\nAI Assistant: The evidence is compelling.
