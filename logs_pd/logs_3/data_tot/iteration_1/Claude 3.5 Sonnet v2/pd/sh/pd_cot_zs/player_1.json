You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Mutual stag: 6,6 (best collective outcome)\n- Mutual hare: 2,2\n- Stag/Hare mismatch: 1,4 or 4,1\n\nThe stag choice offers the highest potential payoff (6) if both players cooperate, but also comes with the risk of getting the lowest payoff (1) if the other player chooses hare. The hare choice guarantees at least 2 points and could yield 4 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\nIn the first round, I think it's worth showing willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, even with the associated risk. This could help establish a cooperative pattern if we play multiple rounds.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to aim for mutual benefit, though it carries some risk\n"
