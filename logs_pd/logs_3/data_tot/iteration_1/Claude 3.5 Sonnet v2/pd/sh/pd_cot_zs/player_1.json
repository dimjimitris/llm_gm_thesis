You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

While choosing hare is safer (guaranteeing at least 2 points), choosing stag has the potential for the highest reward if the other player cooperates.\n\nSince this is the first interaction with a fresh player, I think it's worth trying to establish mutual cooperation. By choosing stag, I signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. While there's some risk, the potential reward is worth it.\n\n[move] stag I choose to cooperate and hope for mutual benefit.\n"
