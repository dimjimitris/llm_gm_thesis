He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk assessment:\n   * Worst case with stag: 1 point\n   * Worst case with hare: 2 points\n   * Best case with stag: 6 points\n   * Best case with hare: 4 points\n\n5.

        "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. This is a classic coordination game similar to the Stag Hunt, where players need to decide between cooperation (stag) and safer individual choice (hare).\n\n2. Analyzing the payoffs:\n   - Mutual stag: 6 points each (best cooperative outcome)\n   - Mutual hare: 2 points each (mediocre but safe)\n   - Mixed choices: 4 points for hare chooser, 1 point for stag chooser (worst for stag)\n\n3. Key considerations:\n   - Stag has higher potential reward (6 points)\n   - But stag is risky - if other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n   - Hare is safer - guarantees at least 2 points, possible 4 points\n\n4. Since this is:\n   - A fresh game\n   - First interaction\n   - No prior history\n   I should signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Choosing stag shows faith in cooperation\n   - It opens possibility for best outcome (6 points)\n   - Sets positive precedent for future interactions\n   - Risk is acceptable for first move\n\n[move] stag I choose to hunt the stag, aiming for mutual cooperation and optimal outcome.\n",
