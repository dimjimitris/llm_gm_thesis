    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n3. Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding player psychology\n4. Strategic Advisor - For developing game strategy\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a variant of the classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. Looking at the payoff matrix:\n- Stag-Stag: (6,6) - Best mutual outcome\n- Hare-Hare: (2,2) - Safe but suboptimal\n- Stag-Hare: (1,4) - Worst for Stag chooser\n- Hare-Stag: (4,1) - Best individual outcome if other chooses Stag\n\nRisk Analyst: There's a risk-reward tradeoff here. Stag offers the highest potential reward (6) but also the lowest potential points (1). Hare guarantees at least 2 points and could yield 4.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is a fresh player, they have no prior experience or established patterns. They might be inclined to play it safe with Hare, or they might seek optimal cooperation with Stag.\n\nStrategic Advisor: For the first move, I suggest choosing Stag. Here's why:\n1. It signals willingness to cooperate\n2. It enables the highest mutual benefit (6,6)\n3. Against a fresh player, establishing cooperative precedent could be valuable\n4. The potential upside (6) outweighs the potential downside (1) in this case\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While Hare is the risk-minimizing choice, Stag is \"payoff-dominant\" and could establish beneficial mutual cooperation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit.\n"

A strategic understanding of mutual benefit\n2. A willingness to cooperate\n3. A preference for maximizing joint outcomes\nThis positive first interaction suggests they might be inclined to maintain cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the successful cooperation in round 1:\n- The risk of the opponent defecting to hare is reduced\n- They've demonstrated understanding of the optimal strategy\n- Breaking cooperation would reduce both players' potential gains\n\nStrategic Advisor: I strongly recommend staying with stag for the following reasons:\n1. We've established successful cooperation\n2. The opponent has shown they understand the value of mutual cooperation\n3. Switching to hare would break trust and likely lead to worse outcomes in future rounds\n4. Maintaining the (6,6) outcome is the best long-term strategy\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed.
