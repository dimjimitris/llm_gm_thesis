Strategic Advisor - For considering psychological aspects and player behavior\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Stag-Stag: (6,6) - Best mutual outcome\n- Hare-Hare: (2,2) - Safe but suboptimal\n- Stag-Hare: (1,4) - Worst for stag chooser\n- Hare-Stag: (4,1) - Best individual outcome if other chooses stag\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since we're playing against a fresh player, they might be inclined to choose the safer option (hare) due to uncertainty. However, establishing cooperation early could lead to better outcomes for both players.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk-reward profile shows:\n- Choosing stag: High reward (6) but high risk of getting minimum points (1)\n- Choosing hare: Moderate reward (4 or 2) with no risk of getting minimum points\n\nGame Theorist: While hare is the risk-dominant strategy, stag is the payoff-dominant strategy. Since this is the first move, we have an opportunity to set a cooperative tone.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend choosing stag to signal willingness to cooperate. While risky, it could establish mutual trust and lead to better outcomes in the long run.\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. The potential upside (6 points) outweighs the worst-case scenario (1 point), especially in establishing initial dynamics.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit.\n"

This suggests our opponent understands the benefits of cooperation.\n\nStrategic Advisor: This is very positive - the other player demonstrated their willingness to cooperate in the first round. Since they've shown trust by choosing stag, maintaining this mutual cooperation would be beneficial for both parties.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the situation:\n- Previous round showed the other player is rational and cooperative\n- They've demonstrated understanding of the mutual benefit strategy\n- Breaking the cooperation now would likely damage future cooperation potential\n- The established trust suggests low risk in continuing with stag\n\nStrategic Advisor: I strongly recommend maintaining the cooperative strategy by choosing stag again. Breaking trust now could lead to a breakdown in cooperation and result in suboptimal outcomes in future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Game theory suggests that in repeated games, maintaining cooperation once established is typically the optimal strategy, as long as both players continue to cooperate.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk profile has actually improved since the first round because we now have evidence of the other player's cooperative tendency. Stag is now both the highest expected value play and carries lower risk than it did in round 1.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Maintaining cooperation following successful mutual trust in the previous round.\n"

Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- (Stag, Stag): (6,6) - Best mutual outcome\n- (Hare, Hare): (2,2) - Safe but suboptimal\n- (Stag, Hare): (1,4) - Worst outcome for Stag chooser\n- (Hare, Stag): (4,1) - Best individual outcome\n\nStrategic Advisor: The key consideration is risk vs. reward. Stag offers the highest mutual benefit but requires trust and coordination. Hare is safer but limits potential gains.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they haven't formed any expectations about our behavior. This is an opportunity to establish a cooperative precedent.\n\nGame Theorist: There are two Nash equilibria in this game: (Stag, Stag) and (Hare, Hare). The Stag-Stag equilibrium is Pareto-optimal but riskier.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this is the first move, I recommend choosing Stag. Here's why:\n1. It signals willingness to cooperate\n2. It opens the possibility for the highest mutual payoff\n3. The downside risk is acceptable given the potential upside\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24.
