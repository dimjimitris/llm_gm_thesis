    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n3. Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding opponent psychology\n4. Strategic Advisor - For synthesizing inputs and forming actionable strategies\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. There are two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The stag-stag combination offers the highest mutual payoff (6,6), but requires trust and cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: True, but choosing stag is risky. If our opponent chooses hare while we choose stag, we only get 1 point while they get 4. Hare is the safer choice, guaranteeing at least 2 points.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first interaction with a fresh player, they have no prior experience or biases. Most players tend to be cautiously cooperative in initial interactions.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this is the first move against a fresh player, we should signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. The potential reward (6 points) from mutual stag hunting is significantly higher than the safe play (2 points from mutual hare). While there's risk, establishing cooperative behavior early could lead to better outcomes.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The first move can set the tone for future interactions. Choosing stag shows both optimism and a willingness to aim for the optimal outcome.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit. This choice offers the highest potential payoff if both players cooperate.\n"

Players who have experienced successful cooperation are more likely to continue that pattern, as it proved beneficial for both parties.\n\nRisk Analyst: While the risk still exists that they might switch to hare, the first round demonstrates our opponent understands the value of mutual cooperation. The risk-reward ratio favors continuing with stag.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given the successful cooperation in round 1 and the established trust, maintaining the cooperative strategy makes the most sense. Breaking the trust now would be counterproductive. We should continue with stag to maintain the beneficial mutual cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Game theory suggests that when players have established successful cooperation, maintaining that equilibrium is the rational choice as long as both players continue to benefit equally.\n\n[move] stag Following our successful cooperation in the previous round, I maintain the stag choice to continue our mutually beneficial strategy.\n"

We've established a productive cooperative relationship that's generating maximum points for both players.
