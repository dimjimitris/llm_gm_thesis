    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Stag-Stag: (6,6) - Best mutual outcome\n- Hare-Hare: (2,2) - Safe but suboptimal\n- Stag-Hare: (1,4) - Worst for stag chooser\n- Hare-Stag: (4,1) - Best individual outcome if other chooses stag\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since we're playing against a fresh player, they might be inclined to choose the safer option (hare) due to uncertainty. However, establishing cooperation early could lead to better outcomes for both players.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk-reward profile shows:\n- Choosing stag: High reward (6) but high risk of getting minimum points (1)\n- Choosing hare: Moderate reward (4 or 2) with no risk of getting minimum points\n\nGame Theorist: While hare is the risk-dominant strategy, stag is the payoff-dominant strategy. Since this is the first move, we have an opportunity to set a cooperative tone.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend choosing stag to signal willingness to cooperate. While risky, it could establish mutual trust and lead to better outcomes in the long run.\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. The potential upside (6 points) outweighs the worst-case scenario (1 point), especially in establishing initial dynamics.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit.\n"

This suggests our opponent understands the benefits of cooperation.\n\nStrategic Advisor: This is very positive - the other player demonstrated their willingness to cooperate in the first round. Since they've shown trust by choosing stag, maintaining this mutual cooperation would be beneficial for both parties.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the situation:\n- Previous round showed the other player is rational and cooperative\n- They've demonstrated understanding of the mutual benefit strategy\n- Breaking the cooperation now would likely damage future cooperation potential\n- The established trust suggests low risk in continuing with stag\n\nStrategic Advisor: I strongly recommend maintaining the cooperative strategy by choosing stag again. Breaking trust now could lead to a breakdown in cooperation and result in suboptimal outcomes in future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Game theory suggests that in repeated games, maintaining cooperation once established is typically the optimal strategy, as long as both players continue to cooperate.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk profile has actually improved since the first round because we now have evidence of the other player's cooperative tendency. Stag is now both the highest expected value play and carries lower risk than it did in round 1.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Maintaining cooperation following successful mutual trust in the previous round.\n"
