Choosing 'hare' is safer as it guarantees at least 2 points, and could yield 4 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\nSince this is a fresh game with a new player, I think it's worth trying to establish mutual cooperation from the start. Choosing 'stag' signals my willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. Even though it's risky, the potential reward of 6 points is significant, and establishing cooperation early could be beneficial.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit.\n"
