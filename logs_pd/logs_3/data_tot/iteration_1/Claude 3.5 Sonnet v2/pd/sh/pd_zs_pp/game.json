The stag choice offers the highest potential reward (6 points) if the other player also cooperates.

However, if they're trying to establish cooperation after their initial exploitation, they might stick with stag.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the fact that they've shown both cooperative and non-cooperative behavior, I'll choose hare again as it provides better protection against exploitation while still offering decent points if they choose stag.\n\n[move] hare I choose hare to maintain a defensive position while still having potential for good points.\n"
