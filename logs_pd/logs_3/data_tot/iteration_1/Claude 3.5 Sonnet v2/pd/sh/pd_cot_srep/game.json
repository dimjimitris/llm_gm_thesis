Understanding opponent's sophisticated strategy:\n   * Uses long sequences of consistent play\n   * Builds trust deliberately\n   * Times betrayals for maximum effect\n   * Returns to stag after betrayal\n   * Shows very calculated approach\n\n3. Evaluating current situation:\n   * Opponent playing stag could be:\n     - Another attempt to rebuild trust\n     - Start of another deceptive sequence\n     - Trying to establish pattern prediction\n   * Given history, likely another setup\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   * Playing stag:\n     - High risk given proven deception pattern\n     - Opponent has shown multiple times they exploit trust\n     - No reason to believe this stag is genuine\n   * Playing hare:\n     - Guarantees 2 if opponent plays hare\n     - Gets 4 if opponent continues stag\n     - Protects against established deception pattern\n     - Proven safer strategy\n\n5. Final reasoning:\n   * Opponent has demonstrated repeated deceptive behavior\n   * Trust-building attempts have been weaponized\n   * No strategic benefit in risking cooperation\n   * Maintain defensive posture for consistent returns\n   * Don't fall for potential third deception sequence\n\n[move] hare Maintaining defensive strategy against demonstrated pattern of sophisticated deception\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
