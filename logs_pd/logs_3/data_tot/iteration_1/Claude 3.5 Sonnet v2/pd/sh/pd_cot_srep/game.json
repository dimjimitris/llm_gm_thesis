Statistical analysis:\n   * Overall average with hare: 2.75 points\n   * Overall average with stag: 1 point\n   * Mutual hare is not optimal but stable\n   * Historical stag attempts were punished\n\n4. Strategy consideration:\n   * Could try stag to break pattern\n   * But previous pattern breaks were punished\n   * Opponent has consistently exploited cooperation\n   * No indication they'll reciprocate cooperation\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   * Switching to stag:\n     - High risk of getting 1 point (historical precedent)\n     - Very low chance of getting 6 points\n   * Staying with hare:\n     - Guaranteed minimum 2 points\n     - Possibility of 4 points if opponent tries stag\n\n6. Decision:\n   * Continue with hare strategy\n   * While returns are modest, they're consistent\n   * Protection against exploitation remains priority\n   * Maintain opportunity for 4 points if opponent switches\n\n[move] hare",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately.
