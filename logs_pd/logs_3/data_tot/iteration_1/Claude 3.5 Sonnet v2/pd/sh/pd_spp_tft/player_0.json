    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

People often start with cooperative behavior in their first interaction. Also, choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider the outcomes:\n- Choosing stag: Could get 6 points (best) or 1 point (worst)\n- Choosing hare: Could get 4 points or 2 points (safer option)\nWhile hare is safer, stag offers the highest potential reward and sends a positive signal for future cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: Given it's the first move and we want to establish cooperation, I recommend choosing stag. It shows faith in cooperation and could lead to the optimal outcome.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with choosing stag for the first move.

The other player chose to cooperate, which is valuable information. This suggests they understand the benefits of mutual cooperation and are willing to take risks for better outcomes.\n\nPsychology Expert: When players successfully achieve mutual cooperation, they tend to stick with that strategy unless given a reason not to. The positive reinforcement of getting the maximum points (6) likely encourages both players to maintain cooperation. The other player has demonstrated trustworthiness.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at our previous success:\n- Our stag choice was matched with stag = optimal outcome achieved\n- The other player has demonstrated cooperative behavior\n- The risk of choosing stag is now lower given the established pattern\n- Breaking the cooperation pattern could damage trust for future rounds\n\nGame Theorist: Given the successful cooperation in round 1 and no indication of defection, maintaining the cooperative strategy (stag) is the rational choice. It maintains trust and continues the optimal outcome path.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree. The first round established mutual trust and cooperation. Breaking this pattern would be counterproductive.

Both players have demonstrated exceptional commitment to maintaining optimal outcomes through a significant number of interactions.\n\nRisk Analyst: Updated situation analysis:\n- Eleven perfect rounds of cooperation\n- Maximum possible points (66) maintained\n- Complete consistency in strategic choices\n- Trust level remains at absolute peak\n- Zero deviations throughout extended play\n- Historical pattern shows unwavering reliability\n- Risk assessment continues to show minimal threat\n- Breaking this pattern after eleven successful rounds would be completely counterintuitive\n\nGame Theorist: After eleven rounds of perfect coordination, game theory principles even more strongly support maintaining our cooperative strategy. The extended pattern of mutual benefit has proven to be incredibly stable and efficient.\n\nAI Assistant (me): All personas remain in complete agreement. With eleven rounds of perfect play and maximum point accumulation, we have established one of the most successful patterns of mutual trust and strategic optimization possible in this game.
