While choosing stag could potentially yield 6 points if they switch to cooperating, their first move suggests they're more likely to continue with hare.\n\n[move] hare Since my opponent showed non-cooperative behavior in the first round, I'll choose hare to protect against exploitation.

Try stag again: Risky but could lead to better outcomes if the opponent is willing to cooperate\n\nGiven that my opponent:\n- First exploited my cooperative move\n- Then played it safe with hare\n\nI think it's worth trying stag one more time.

However, staying in mutual hare choice is sub-optimal for both of us. There might be value in trying to establish cooperation again, even with the risk.\n\n[move] stag I'll try stag again to see if we can break out of the low-reward equilibrium. While this carries risk, the potential reward of establishing mutual cooperation (6 points) could be worth it. This also signals that I'm willing to return to cooperation despite past exploitation.\n",

This is better than the 1 point I got from playing stag against their hare, but still not optimal.\n\nLet's analyze:\n1. Round 1: I played stag, they played hare (1 point for me)\n2. Round 2: We both played hare (2 points for me)\n\nThere's a possibility that my opponent:\n- Always plays hare as a fixed strategy\n- Or adapts to match my previous move\n- Or might be willing to switch to stag if shown it could be beneficial\n\nI think I'll take a calculated risk here. By playing stag again, I can:\n- Test if they have a fixed strategy\n- Signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n- Potentially break out of the lower-paying hare-hare equilibrium\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing stag to test if my opponent might be willing to cooperate for mutual benefit after experiencing the suboptimal hare-hare outcome.\n"
