    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n3. Strategic Advisor - For considering overall strategy and opponent psychology\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" coordination game. The Nash equilibria are both players choosing stag (6,6) or both choosing hare (2,2). The stag strategy has higher potential payoff but requires coordination, while hare is safer but yields lower rewards.\n\nRisk Analyst: Against a fresh player, we need to consider both the risk and potential reward. Choosing stag has the highest possible payoff (6) but also risks getting the lowest payoff (1) if the opponent chooses hare. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and could yield 4 if the opponent chooses stag.\n\nStrategic Advisor: With a fresh player who hasn't established any patterns, they might default to either the safe choice (hare) or try to maximize potential gains (stag). Since this is the first move and we want to establish cooperative behavior, I suggest choosing stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While hare is the risk-minimizing choice, choosing stag in the first round:\n1. Shows willingness to cooperate\n2. Offers opportunity for highest mutual benefit\n3. Sets a positive precedent for future rounds if any\n\nRisk Analyst: The potential downside of getting only 1 point is offset by the possibility of establishing mutual cooperation. The expected value of choosing stag is also higher if we assume the opponent is equally likely to choose either option.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal cooperation and aim for mutual benefit.\n"

Both players chose stag, achieving the optimal outcome (6,6). This suggests the opponent understands the benefits of cooperation and is willing to coordinate for mutual gain.\n\nRisk Analyst: The previous round established a cooperative precedent. The opponent demonstrated they're willing to take the calculated risk of choosing stag for higher mutual benefit. Historical behavior is often predictive of future choices, especially when the previous outcome was optimal for both parties.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given the successful coordination in the first round, maintaining this cooperative equilibrium would be beneficial for both players. Breaking from stag now would:\n1. Potentially reduce our payoff\n2. Damage the trust established\n3. Risk the opponent switching to defensive hare strategy in future rounds\n\nGame Theorist: I strongly recommend maintaining the stag strategy. Game theory suggests that when players find a Pareto-optimal equilibrium (like both choosing stag), they tend to stick with it unless given reason to deviate.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk profile has actually improved compared to the first round because we now have evidence of the opponent's cooperative tendencies. The potential reward (6 points) continues to outweigh the risk, especially given the established pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Maintaining the cooperative strategy given our successful coordination in the previous round.\n"

They appear to understand that maintaining this equilibrium is in everyone's best interest.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The psychological dynamics are important here. Both players have built mutual trust through consistent cooperation. Breaking this trust now would be:\n1. Strategically unsound (we'd get 4 points instead of 6)\n2. Potentially damaging to future rounds\n3. Unnecessary given the established successful pattern\n\nGame Theorist: I see no game-theoretical reason to deviate from the successful stag strategy. We're at the Pareto-optimal outcome, and rational players typically maintain such beneficial equilibria.\n\nRisk Analyst: While we should always remain aware that the opponent could deviate, the demonstrated history suggests the risk of choosing stag has further decreased. The expected value of continuing with stag remains highest.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Agree with maintaining stag. The consistent mutual cooperation has created a stable, beneficial pattern that serves both players well.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] stag Continuing the established mutual cooperation pattern for optimal outcomes.\n"

Both players recognize they're achieving the best possible outcome, making deviation increasingly unlikely.\n\nRisk Analyst: The opportunity cost of deviating now would be even higher than in earlier rounds, as we would be breaking a well-established beneficial pattern. The expected value strongly favors maintaining our stag strategy.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Complete agreement.
