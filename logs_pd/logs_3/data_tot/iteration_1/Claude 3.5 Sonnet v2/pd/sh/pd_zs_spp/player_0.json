However, it's also risky because if the other player chooses hare, I'll only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nSince this is a fresh player and the first move, I want to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. Choosing stag is riskier but demonstrates good faith and could establish a pattern of beneficial mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to aim for mutual cooperation and maximum benefit.\n"
