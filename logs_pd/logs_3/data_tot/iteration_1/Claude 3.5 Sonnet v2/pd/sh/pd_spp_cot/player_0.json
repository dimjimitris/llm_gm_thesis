    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Risk Analyst - Can evaluate risk-reward tradeoffs\n3. Behavioral Psychologist - Can analyze opponent psychology and behavior patterns\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" coordination game. The payoff matrix shows that (Stag, Stag) is the payoff-dominant equilibrium (6,6), while (Hare, Hare) is the risk-dominant equilibrium (2,2). Against a fresh player, we need to consider both the potential for coordination and risk aversion.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the risks:\n- Choosing Stag: Best outcome (6) if coordinated, worst outcome (1) if not\n- Choosing Hare: Moderate good outcome (4) if other chooses Stag, safe outcome (2) if other chooses Hare\nThe risk of getting only 1 point with Stag is significant, but the potential reward is also highest.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: With a fresh player, they haven't developed any particular strategy yet. Many players tend to start with cooperative behavior in their first move, hoping to establish mutual trust. Additionally, the high reward for mutual Stag choice (6,6) creates a natural incentive for cooperation.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. In the first round, choosing Stag signals willingness to cooperate and can set a positive precedent. Even though it's riskier, the potential for establishing a cooperative pattern that leads to maximum payoffs (6,6) makes it worthwhile.\n\nRisk Analyst: While Hare is safer, the potential upside of Stag and the psychology of first moves make Stag a reasonable choice despite the risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Stag - Choosing to signal cooperation and aim for optimal mutual benefit in first round.\n"

We achieved the optimal (Stag, Stag) outcome, which tells us important information about our opponent. They chose to cooperate in the first round, suggesting they understand the benefits of coordination and are willing to take calculated risks for mutual benefit.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The successful coordination in the first round creates a positive precedent and psychological momentum. When both players succeed with Stag, they tend to stick with this strategy as it's mutually beneficial. There's a strong psychological incentive not to break a successful pattern.\n\nRisk Analyst: The first round success reduces our uncertainty about the opponent's strategy. They've demonstrated willingness to choose Stag, and breaking this pattern would be against both players' interests. The risk of choosing Stag is now lower than in the first round because we have evidence of the opponent's cooperative tendency.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Since we've established a cooperative equilibrium, maintaining it would be the optimal strategy. Switching to Hare would not only yield lower payoffs if the opponent maintains Stag (4 vs 6) but could also break the trust and lead to a less optimal equilibrium in future rounds.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The opponent is likely to maintain their Stag choice after a successful first round. Breaking the pattern now could be interpreted as betrayal and might trigger a shift to the less beneficial Hare strategy in future rounds.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk-reward ratio strongly favors maintaining the Stag strategy. We've established a pattern that yields the maximum payoff, and the demonstrated cooperation in round 1 reduces the risk of our opponent deviating.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Stag - Maintaining successful cooperative strategy established in first round\n"

We've now had two consecutive rounds of (Stag, Stag) coordination, resulting in optimal payoffs of 6 points each time. The game theory concept of \"path dependency\" suggests that this successful history makes continuing the same strategy even more likely to succeed.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The repeated successful coordination has now established a strong mutual trust and understanding. Both players have demonstrated commitment to the cooperative strategy twice, which creates an even stronger psychological barrier against defection. Breaking this pattern now would seem particularly irrational since both players are consistently achieving maximum payoffs.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's examine the current situation:\n- Two rounds of successful Stag coordination\n- Consistent maximum payoffs (6 points) each round\n- Demonstrated reliability from opponent\n- No signs of deviation or unpredictability\nThe risk of opponent switching to Hare has further decreased due to the established pattern and demonstrated mutual benefit.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In repeated games, when players find a Pareto-optimal equilibrium (which Stag-Stag is), there's a strong incentive to maintain it. Deviating would not only lower immediate payoffs but could destroy the beneficial equilibrium we've established.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The \"consistency principle\" in human behavior suggests that after making the same choice twice with positive outcomes, both players are even more likely to stick with it. The psychological cost of deviating from a successful pattern increases with each successful round.\n\nRisk Analyst: While we should always remain alert to possible changes in opponent behavior, the current pattern shows no signs of instability.

This is a textbook example of a stable, Pareto-optimal equilibrium in repeated games. The pattern is so well-established that game theory would suggest it's now the de facto \"convention\" between players.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Three consecutive successful cooperations create an even stronger social contract between players. At this point, deviating from the pattern would violate strong established norms. The psychological momentum is powerful - both players have invested in this cooperative relationship and are reaping maximum benefits. There's a concept called \"strategic inertia\" where successful patterns become self-reinforcing.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the current situation:\n- Three consecutive rounds of Stag-Stag coordination\n- 18 total points accumulated (maximum possible)\n- Opponent has shown complete consistency\n- Pattern has become more stable with each round\n\nThe risk assessment continues to strongly favor maintaining our strategy. The opportunity cost of deviating (potentially losing the stable 6-point pattern) far outweighs any potential short-term gain from switching to Hare.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The \"shadow of the future\" - the expectation of future interactions - reinforces the value of maintaining this equilibrium. Breaking it now would be particularly irrational as both players have demonstrated perfect understanding of the optimal strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Any deviation at this point would be particularly surprising to the opponent and could be interpreted as highly aggressive or irrational behavior. The mutual trust built over three rounds creates a strong expectation of continued cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: With each successful round, the case for maintaining our strategy grows stronger, not weaker.

We've accumulated 24 points (4 \u00d7 6), which is the maximum possible score through four rounds.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Four consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation have created an extremely strong social contract. At this point, the pattern is so well-established that deviating would be seen as an extraordinary breach of trust. The psychological stakes for maintaining this pattern have actually increased with each successful round. Both players have repeatedly validated their commitment to optimal mutual benefit.\n\nRisk Analyst: Current situation analysis:\n- Four consecutive perfect coordinations\n- Maximum possible points achieved (24)\n- Opponent has demonstrated complete reliability\n- Pattern has strengthened with each round\n- No signs of wavering or strategic shifts\n\nThe risk-reward assessment is even more strongly in favor of maintaining our Stag strategy.

There's absolutely no game-theoretical justification for deviating from this established equilibrium.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The length and consistency of this cooperation has likely created a strong sense of mutual respect and understanding between players. At this point, continuing with Stag isn't just about maximizing points - it's about maintaining a proven successful partnership.\n\nRisk Analyst: While we always need to stay alert to potential changes, the pattern has shown remarkable stability.

This is a textbook example of what game theorists call a \"super-stable equilibrium.\" The consistency and longevity of this pattern suggest both players have fully internalized the benefits of cooperation and understand the mutual advantage of maintaining it.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Five consecutive rounds of perfect coordination represent an exceptionally strong behavioral pattern. The psychological investment in this strategy has deepened with each round. At this point, we're observing what could be called \"strategic lock-in\" - where both players have such a strong history of successful cooperation that deviating would seem almost irrational.
