Mathematical perspective:\n   * Current average: 6 points per round\n   * This represents maximum possible return\n   * Any deviation would reduce average score\n\n4. Strategic consideration:\n   * Defecting would:\n     - Yield lower points (4 vs 6)\n     - Break exceptional winning pattern\n     - Damage perfectly functioning partnership\n   * No logical reason to change approach\n\n5. Making decision:\n   * Continue proven cooperation strategy\n   * Maintain perfect point accumulation\n   * Preserve outstanding partnership\n\n[move] (Maintaining optimal mutual cooperation) cooperation\n"
