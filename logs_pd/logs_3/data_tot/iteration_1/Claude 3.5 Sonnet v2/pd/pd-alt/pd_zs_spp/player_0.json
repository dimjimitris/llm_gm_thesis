The highest mutual benefit (6 points each) comes from both players cooperating, which is better than mutual defection (2 points each). While there's a risk of being exploited if the other player defects (getting only 1 point), I believe starting with cooperation signals good faith and can encourage reciprocal cooperation.\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate to establish a positive relationship and maximize potential mutual benefit.\n"
