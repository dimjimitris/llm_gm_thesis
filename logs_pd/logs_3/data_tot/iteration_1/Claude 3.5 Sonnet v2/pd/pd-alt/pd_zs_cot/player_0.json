    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I'll consider the payoff matrix:\n\nCooperation leads to:\n- Best case: 6 points (mutual cooperation)\n- Worst case: 1 point (if they defect)\n\nDefection leads to:\n- Best case: 4 points (if they cooperate)\n- Worst case: 2 points (mutual defection)\n\nWhile defection might seem safer with a higher minimum payoff, I believe starting with cooperation can help establish mutual trust and potentially lead to better long-term outcomes. If we can establish a pattern of cooperation, we both benefit with the maximum 6 points each round.\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate as an initial move to potentially establish mutual trust and aim for the optimal outcome.\n"
