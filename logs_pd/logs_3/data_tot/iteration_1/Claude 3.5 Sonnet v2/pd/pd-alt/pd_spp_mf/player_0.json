    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychologist - For understanding player behavior and cooperation dynamics\n3. Strategic Advisor - For integrating different perspectives and making recommendations\n\nStarting collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario. The highest mutual benefit (6,6) comes from cooperation, while the worst individual outcome (1) comes from cooperating when the other defects. The temptation to defect (4 points) is present, but if both players defect, both get suboptimal outcomes (2,2).\n\nPsychologist: Since we're playing against a fresh player, they haven't established any pattern yet. First impressions are important in establishing trust. Starting with cooperation could signal good faith and potentially lead to mutual cooperation, which has the highest total payoff.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with starting cooperatively. While defection provides some protection against exploitation (minimum 2 points vs 1 point), mutual cooperation (6 points each) is clearly superior to mutual defection (2 points each). Starting with cooperation gives us the best chance to establish a positive dynamic.\n\nGame Theorist: Yes, and mathematically, if we can establish mutual cooperation, it's the best steady-state outcome (6 points per round vs any other combination).\n\nPsychologist: Also, since this is the first move, showing good faith through cooperation might encourage reciprocal cooperative behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] cooperate (Starting with cooperation to establish trust and aim for mutual benefit)\n"

Psychology research suggests that maintaining consistent cooperative behavior can reinforce this trust and lead to continued mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since both players benefited from cooperation in the first round, it makes strategic sense to maintain this positive dynamic. Switching to defection now could break the trust and lead to a cycle of mutual defection, which would result in lower payoffs (2 points) for both players.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Game theory supports maintaining cooperation here. The other player has shown they understand the value of mutual cooperation, and we should reinforce this behavior.\n\nPsychologist: The reciprocity principle suggests that people tend to respond in kind to how they are treated.
