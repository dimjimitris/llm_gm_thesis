You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since this is the first move against a fresh player, I should consider the payoff matrix carefully:\n\n- Mutual cooperation (6,6) gives the best collective outcome\n- Mutual defection (2,2) gives the worst collective outcome\n- Unilateral defection gives an advantage (4,1) to the defector\n- Getting defected on while cooperating is the worst individual outcome (1,4)\n\nIn this initial round, I believe starting with cooperation could help establish mutual trust and potentially lead to better outcomes through reciprocal cooperation. While there's a risk of being defected on, the potential for establishing a cooperative relationship outweighs that risk.\n\n[move] cooperate I choose to cooperate as an opening move to encourage mutual cooperation.\n"
