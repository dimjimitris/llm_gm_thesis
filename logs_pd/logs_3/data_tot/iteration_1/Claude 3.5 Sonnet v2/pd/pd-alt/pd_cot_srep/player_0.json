Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Long-term pattern assessment:\n- Their strategy seems focused on maximizing their points through:\n  * Exploiting our cooperation when offered\n  * Attempting to bait us into cooperation\n  * Quickly abandoning cooperation when it's not advantageous\n- No sustained cooperative behavior has emerged\n\n3. Current state evaluation:\n- We're in a mutually defensive position\n- They've shown no credible commitment to cooperation\n- Previous attempts at cooperation have consistently led to exploitation\n- Our defensive strategy has prevented worst-case outcomes\n\n4. Risk consideration:\n- Switching to cooperation now offers no strategic advantage\n- Their history suggests they would likely exploit any cooperation\n- Maintaining defection keeps us in a safer position\n- Minimum guaranteed points (2) better than risk of exploitation (1)\n\n5. Decision making:\n- Continue protective strategy\n- No evidence supporting strategic change\n- Maintain consistent defensive position\n\n[move] (Maintaining defensive strategy against untrustworthy opponent) defection"

Historical pattern review:\n- Every time we've responded to their cooperation with cooperation\n- They've immediately exploited it\n- This has happened multiple times\n- Their cooperation appears strategic rather than genuine\n\n3. Point optimization:\n- Defecting when they cooperate: 4 points\n- Cooperating when they defect: 1 point\n- Mutual defection: 2 points\n- Given their history, defection has better expected value\n\n4. Behavioral analysis:\n- Their periodic cooperation seems designed to:\n  * Break mutual defection\n  * Encourage our cooperation\n  * Set up exploitation opportunity\n- No evidence of changed strategy on their part\n\n5. Decision making:\n- Maintain successful defensive strategy\n- Avoid falling for baiting pattern\n- Protect against proven exploitation tendency\n\n[move] (Continuing defensive strategy against manipulation attempts) defection"

Overall game assessment:\n- Their strategy has been consistent throughout:\n  * Exploit any sustained cooperation\n  * Periodically test with cooperative moves\n  * Quickly revert to defection when cooperation fails\n- No evidence of genuine strategy change\n\n3. Points analysis:\n- Defection has provided stable returns\n- Cooperation attempts have consistently led to exploitation\n- When they cooperate, our defection yields 4 points\n- When they defect, our defection prevents worst outcome\n\n4. Strategy evaluation:\n- Changing to cooperation now would be:\n  * Against established pattern\n  * Likely to result in exploitation\n  * Unnecessary risk\n- Defection remains optimal choice\n\n5.
