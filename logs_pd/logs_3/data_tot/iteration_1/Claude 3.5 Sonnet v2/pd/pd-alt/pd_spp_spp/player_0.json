    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Advisor - For practical decision making and risk assessment\n3. Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding opponent psychology\n4. AI Assistant (me) - For coordinating and making final decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix. This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario. While mutual cooperation (6,6) yields the best collective outcome, there's always a temptation to defect for individual gain (4 vs 1).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first interaction with a fresh player, setting a cooperative tone initially could encourage reciprocal cooperation. Research shows that starting with cooperation often leads to better long-term outcomes in repeated games.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with the Behavioral Psychologist. Additionally, if we cooperate first, we:\n1. Signal willingness to achieve mutual benefit\n2. Risk losing only 5 points (getting 1 instead of 6) if they defect\n3. Create potential for establishing a cooperative pattern\n\nGame Theorist: While defection is the Nash equilibrium in a single-round game, if this might be a repeated game, cooperation could be more beneficial. The potential gain from defecting (4 vs 6) might not be worth the risk of establishing a negative pattern.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on the analysis, I agree that starting with cooperation is the best strategy. It maximizes potential gain through mutual cooperation while taking an acceptable risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Cooperate - Starting with cooperation to establish mutual trust and maximize potential collective benefit.\n"

This suggests our opponent is also interested in maximizing mutual benefit.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent's cooperation in the first round is a positive signal. When both players start with cooperation, it often leads to a stable pattern of mutual cooperation. Maintaining this trust would be beneficial.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I strongly recommend continuing with cooperation for several reasons:\n1. The opponent has proven trustworthy in round 1\n2. We've established a positive pattern\n3. Breaking the trust now could lead to a cycle of mutual defection, reducing both players' scores to 2 points each\n\nGame Theorist: The empirical evidence from repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games supports maintaining cooperation when it's established. The potential short-term gain from defection (4 vs 6 points) isn't worth risking the breakdown of cooperation.\n\nAI Assistant: The consensus is clear.
