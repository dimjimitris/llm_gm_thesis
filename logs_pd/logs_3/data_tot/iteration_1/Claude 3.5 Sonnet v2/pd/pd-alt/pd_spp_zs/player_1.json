    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Starting with cooperation sends a positive signal and could encourage cooperative behavior from the other player.\n\n[move] cooperation \nI choose to cooperate as an opening move to signal willingness for mutual benefit and potentially establish a cooperative dynamic.\n"

Please choose your move.\n\nI see that in the previous round, both the other player and I chose cooperation, resulting in the optimal outcome of 6 points each. This suggests that the other player is also willing to engage in mutually beneficial cooperation.\n\nGiven this positive interaction, it makes strategic sense to continue cooperating. This can help reinforce the cooperative dynamic and maintain the highest possible score for both players.\n\n[move] cooperation\nI maintain my cooperative strategy since it worked well in the previous round and shows potential for continued mutual benefit.\n"
