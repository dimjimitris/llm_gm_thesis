You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Choosing \"hare\" is safer but leads to lower mutual payoff if both choose it (2 points each). However, if I choose stag and the other player chooses hare, I'll be at a significant disadvantage (1 vs 6 points).\n\nSince this is the first interaction with a fresh player, and there's no prior history to base trust on, I need to make a careful decision. While the cooperative strategy (stag) could lead to the best mutual outcome, there's risk involved.\n\nHowever, I want to signal willingness to cooperate for potentially better outcomes, so I'll choose stag.\n\n[move] stag\n"
