Choosing hare is safer but yields lower rewards when both players choose it (2 points each).\n\nSince this is the first interaction with a fresh player, I want to signal willingness to cooperate while also acknowledging there's some risk. The potential for mutual benefit (4 points) from both choosing stag is significantly better than the safe option of both choosing hare (2 points).\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n"
