Pattern recognition:\n   * Clear alternating pattern emerging after betrayals\n   * They play stag after I play hare\n   * They've done this multiple times (Rounds 2, 6, 12)\n\n3. Opponent strategy analysis:\n   * They seem to expect reciprocity\n   * When I play hare, they try to re-establish cooperation with stag\n   * This has been consistent throughout the game\n\n4. Risk vs Reward evaluation:\n   * If I maintain hare and they switch to hare: get 2 points\n   * If I switch to stag and they switch to hare: get 1 point\n   * If I switch to stag and they maintain stag: get 4 points\n   * If I maintain hare and they maintain stag: get 6 points\n\n5. Historical success patterns:\n   * Maintaining hare after successful exploitation has often led to good outcomes\n   * Switching to stag too quickly has led to exploitation\n\n6. Decision making:\n   * Opponent's pattern suggests they'll try to punish hare play\n   * However, immediate switch to stag has been costly before\n   * Better to maintain defensive position for one more round\n   * Can reassess cooperation after seeing their response\n\n[move] hare Maintaining defensive position while assessing opponent's response\n"
