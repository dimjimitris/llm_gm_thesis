Choosing hare provides a safer minimum payoff but limits the maximum possible benefit.\n\nSince this is the first move against a fresh player, I believe demonstrating cooperative intent by choosing stag could help establish mutual trust and lead to better outcomes. While there's some risk, the potential reward of mutual stag hunting (4 points each) outweighs the safer but lower payoff of mutual hare hunting (2 points each).\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing to demonstrate cooperative intent and trust in hopes of achieving mutual benefit.\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
