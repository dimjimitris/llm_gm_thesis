Choosing hare provides a safer minimum payoff but limits the maximum possible benefit.\n\nSince this is the first move against a fresh player, I believe demonstrating cooperative intent by choosing stag could help establish mutual trust and lead to better outcomes. While there's some risk, the potential reward of mutual stag hunting (4 points each) outweighs the safer but lower payoff of mutual hare hunting (2 points each).\n\n[move] stag I'm choosing to demonstrate cooperative intent and trust in hopes of achieving mutual benefit.\n"
