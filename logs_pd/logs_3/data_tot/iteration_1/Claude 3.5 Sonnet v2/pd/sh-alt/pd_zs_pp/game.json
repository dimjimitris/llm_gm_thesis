By choosing stag, I signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. While this carries some risk (I could get only 1 point if they choose hare), the potential reward of 4 points if they also choose stag makes it worthwhile.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to aim for mutual cooperation and optimal outcome.\n"

The stag-stag outcome (4,4) is Pareto optimal and gives the highest mutual benefit, but requires trust and coordination.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I'll take an optimistic approach and aim for the cooperative, higher-payoff equilibrium. By choosing stag, I signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. While this carries some risk (I could get only 1 point if they choose hare), the potential reward of 4 points if they also choose stag makes it worthwhile.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to aim for mutual cooperation and optimal outcome.\n",

Choosing stag offers the possibility of the best mutual outcome (4,4), though it carries some risk. If we can establish mutual trust through stag hunting, it could lead to better long-term results.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to attempt establishing mutually beneficial cooperation from the start.\n",

Choosing hare is safer since the worst outcome is 2 points, and there's potential for 6 points if the other player chooses stag.\n\nSince this is a fresh player with no history, I'll try to establish a cooperative precedent by choosing stag.
