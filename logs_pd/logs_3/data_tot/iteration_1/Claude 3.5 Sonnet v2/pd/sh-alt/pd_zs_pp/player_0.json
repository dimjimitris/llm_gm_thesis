The stag-stag outcome (4,4) is Pareto optimal and gives the highest mutual benefit, but requires trust and coordination.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I'll take an optimistic approach and aim for the cooperative, higher-payoff equilibrium. By choosing stag, I signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. While this carries some risk (I could get only 1 point if they choose hare), the potential reward of 4 points if they also choose stag makes it worthwhile.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to aim for mutual cooperation and optimal outcome.\n"
