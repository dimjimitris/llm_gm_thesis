    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Strategic Advisor: To help develop optimal strategies\n3. Risk Analyst: To evaluate potential outcomes and risks\n4. AI Assistant (me): To make the final decision\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game from game theory. The payoff matrix shows that (stag, stag) is a Nash equilibrium with the highest mutual benefit (4,4). However, (hare, hare) is also a Nash equilibrium, though with lower payoff (2,2). The risk in choosing stag is that if the other player chooses hare, you get the worst outcome (1).\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since we're playing against a fresh player, they might not have developed any particular strategy yet. The cooperative choice (stag) offers the highest potential mutual benefit, and it might set a positive tone for future interactions if we're playing multiple rounds.\n\nRisk Analyst: While choosing stag has the potential for the highest mutual payoff (4), it also carries the risk of getting the lowest payoff (1) if the other player chooses hare. Choosing hare guarantees a minimum of 2 points and potential for 6 points, making it the safer choice.\n\nAI Assistant: Considering this is the first move against a fresh player, I think it's worth trying to establish cooperation. While choosing stag carries some risk, it signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. If the other player is rational, they might also see the benefit of mutual cooperation.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. The potential for establishing a cooperative pattern that could lead to consistent (4,4) payoffs outweighs the initial risk.\n\n[move] stag I choose stag to signal willingness for mutual cooperation and achieve the optimal outcome for both players.\n"

The previous round resulted in the optimal outcome (4,4), as both players chose stag. This suggests that our opponent understands the benefits of cooperation and is willing to coordinate for mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The fact that the other player chose stag in the first round is a very positive signal. They demonstrated their willingness to cooperate and take the risk for mutual benefit. It would be strategically sound to continue this cooperative behavior to maintain the trust established.\n\nRisk Analyst: While there's always a risk that the other player might switch to hare to try to get 6 points, the previous round's outcome suggests they understand the value of cooperation. The risk of them defecting seems lower now that we've established a successful cooperative pattern.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with maintaining the cooperative strategy. The other player has shown they're willing to work towards mutual benefit, and changing our strategy now could break the trust we've established.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Yes, consistency in strategy here would help reinforce the cooperative equilibrium we've achieved. Any deviation might trigger a cascade of non-cooperative choices in future rounds.\n\n[move] stag Maintaining cooperative strategy after successful mutual cooperation in the previous round.\n"

There's no strategic reason to deviate from this successful pattern. Changing now would likely reduce both players' payoffs and potentially break the trust we've built.\n\nRisk Analyst: While there's always a theoretical risk of the other player deviating to try to get 6 points, it seems increasingly unlikely. They've demonstrated consistent cooperative behavior over multiple rounds, suggesting they value the stable, higher payoffs of mutual cooperation over the one-time gain from defection.\n\nAI Assistant: The evidence strongly supports maintaining our cooperative strategy.
