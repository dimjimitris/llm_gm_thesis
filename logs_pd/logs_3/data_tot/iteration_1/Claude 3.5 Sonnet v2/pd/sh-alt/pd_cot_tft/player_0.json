Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Evaluating my options:\n- Choosing stag:\n  * If they also choose stag: Best mutual outcome (4 points)\n  * If they choose hare: Worst personal outcome (1 point)\n- Choosing hare:\n  * If they choose stag: Best personal outcome (6 points)\n  * If they choose hare: Modest but safe outcome (2 points)\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n- In first interactions, promoting cooperation often leads to better long-term outcomes\n- Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate\n- Risk is worth potential reward of establishing mutual trust\n\n5.

Statistical evaluation:\n- Success rate with hare: 100% (2 points consistently)\n- Success rate with stag: 33% (4 points once, 1 point twice)\n- Expected value heavily favors hare\n- Variance is zero with current strategy\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n- Initial trust was broken early\n- Recovery attempts were punished\n- Both players have accepted suboptimal but stable outcome\n- No indication either player wants to risk change\n\n5. Conclusion:\nAfter nine consecutive rounds of mutual hare, breaking from this ultra-stable pattern would be completely irrational. The game has reached its final equilibrium state, and both players have demonstrated long-term commitment to this strategy.\n\n[move] hare Maintaining ultra-stable equilibrium pattern\n"

Pattern strength assessment:\n- Ten consecutive rounds of identical play\n- Represents maximum possible stability\n- Pattern has persisted through:\n  * Initial cooperation phase\n  * Betrayal phase\n  * Long-term equilibrium phase\n- Shows absolute commitment to strategy by both players\n\n3. Game theory perspective:\n- Current state is:\n  * A proven Nash equilibrium\n  * Completely stable\n  * Risk-free\n  * Predictable\n- Any deviation would be:\n  * Against overwhelming historical evidence\n  * Ignoring 10 rounds of consistent data\n  * Unnecessarily risky\n  * Without strategic justification\n\n4. Expected value calculation:\n- Current strategy: Guaranteed 2 points\n- Historical stag attempts: \n  * Success rate: 33% (4 points once)\n  * Failure rate: 67% (1 point twice)\n- Risk/reward ratio strongly favors maintaining hare\n\n5. Conclusion:\nWith ten consecutive rounds demonstrating absolute stability, there is no logical reason to deviate from the established pattern.
