Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "Let's think this through step-by-step to determine the best move:\n\n1. **Understand the Game Dynamics**:\n   - If both players cooperate, each gets 6 points.\n   - If both players defect, each gets 2 points.\n   - If one player cooperates and the other defects, the cooperator gets 1 point and the defector gets 4 points.\n\n2. **Assess the Best Outcome**:\n   - The best possible outcome for me is if I defect and the other player cooperates. In this scenario, I get 4 points.\n   - The best possible outcome for the other player is if they defect and I cooperate. In this scenario, they get 4 points.\n\n3. **Assess the Worst Outcome**:\n   - The worst outcome for me is if I cooperate and the other player defects. In this scenario, I get only 1 point.\n   - The worst outcome for the other player is if they cooperate and I defect. In this scenario, they get only 1 point.\n\n4. **Assess Mutual Cooperation and Defection**:\n   - If we both cooperate, we each get 6 points. This is a better outcome than mutual defection, where we each get only 2 points.\n   - Mutual cooperation yields a higher total reward for both players combined.\n\n5. **Strategy Consideration**:\n   - Since I am playing against a fresh player, there is no history of their behavior to base my decision on.\n   - Cooperating initially can set a positive tone and encourage the other player to cooperate in future rounds, which could lead to higher mutual gains.\n   - Defecting might be tempting for immediate gain, but it risks setting a negative tone and lower mutual gains in the future.\n\n6. **Final Decision**:\n   - Given the potential for higher long-term gains through mutual cooperation and the lack of information on the other player's strategy, I will start by cooperating.\n\n   [move] I choose cooperation to set a cooperative tone and aim for mutual high rewards.\n"
