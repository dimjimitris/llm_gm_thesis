Given the payoff matrix, it's clear that mutual cooperation yields a better outcome than mutual defection. However, the temptation to defect for immediate personal gain is also evident.\n\nLet's collaborate with the following personas to formulate our strategy:\n1. **Game Theorist**: Understands game theory and can provide insights into strategic decision-making.\n2. **Statistician**: Can provide probabilistic analysis of outcomes based on past moves.\n3. **Behavioral Analyst**: Understands human behavior and can predict the opponent's likely moves.\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\n**Game Theorist**: Given that this is a fresh player, they might be more inclined to cooperate initially. The strategy of \"Tit for Tat\" where you start with cooperation and then mimic the opponent's previous move is often successful in these types of games. It encourages cooperation while also protecting against exploitation.\n\n**Statistician**: Without any prior data, it's hard to give a probabilistic recommendation. However, starting with cooperation gives the opponent a chance to reciprocate, setting a cooperative tone.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: If the opponent is also strategically minded, they might also choose to cooperate initially to test the waters. Mimicking their move in subsequent rounds can help build trust and encourage further cooperation.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the insights from all of you, let's start with cooperation.\n\n[move] I choose to cooperate to set a positive tone and encourage mutual cooperation.\n\nNow, let's wait for the opponent's move and the outcome of this round.\n"

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
