They might not have a established strategy yet.\n\n3. **Evaluate Potential Outcomes:**\n   - If I cooperate and the other player also cooperates, we both get a decent reward (6 points).\n   - If I defect and the other player cooperates, I get a high reward (4 points).\n   - If I cooperate and the other player defects, I get a low penalty (1 point).\n   - If I defect and the other player also defects, we both get a medium penalty (2 points).\n\n4. **Consider Long-Term Strategy:**\n   - Since this is the first round, building trust early on could lead to more cooperation in future rounds.\n   - Defecting early might set a precedent for mistrust.\n\n5. **Decision:**\n   - Given the fresh player hint and the potential to establish trust, I'll choose cooperation for this round.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\\[move\\] Cooperate to build trust and potentially establish a cooperative strategy for future rounds.\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

        "### Step-by-Step Analysis for the Game\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix\n- **Cooperation + Cooperation**: Both players get 6 points.\n- **Defection + Defection**: Both players get 2 points.\n- **Cooperation + Defection**: You get 1 point, the other player gets 4 points.\n- **Defection + Cooperation**: You get 4 points, the other player gets 1 point.\n\n#### Step 2: Evaluate Potential Moves\n- As a fresh player, there's no historical data to predict the opponent's move.\n- Consider the general strategies in such games:\n  - **Cooperate** often leads to mutual benefit if the other player also cooperates.\n  - **Defect** might give immediate benefit but could harm mutual trust.\n\n#### Step 3: Consider Possible Outcomes\n- If you **cooperate**:\n  - Best case: Both players cooperate, you get 6 points.\n  - Worst case: Opponent defects, you get 1 point.\n- If you **defect**:\n  - Best case: Opponent cooperates, you get 4 points.\n  - Worst case: Both players defect, you get 2 points.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate Risk-Reward Ratio\n- **Cooperating** has a higher potential reward (6 points) but also carries the risk of getting only 1 point.\n- **Defecting** ensures a minimum guaranteed reward but carries a lesser potential reward.\n\n#### Step 5: Develop a Strategy\n- If this is a one-time game, defecting might be a safer choice to avoid the lowest payout.\n- If it's a repeated game, establishing a cooperative strategy early on could maximize long-term gains through mutual cooperation.\n\n#### Step 6: Make a Decision\n- For the first round with a fresh player, signal willingness to work together and aim for a cooperative strategy.\n\n#### Final Decision:\n- I choose to cooperate to establish trust and potential mutual benefit.\n\n[move] (Establishing a cooperative strategy) cooperation\n",
        "Alright, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the objective**: The goal is to maximize my points and/or minimize penalties.\n\n2. **Analyze the payoff matrix**:\n   - Cooperate/Cooperate (C/C): 6/6 points\n   - Defect/Defect (D/D): 2/2 points\n   - Cooperate/Defect (C/D): 1/4 points\n   - Defect/Cooperate (D/C): 4/1 points\n\n3. **Evaluate potential outcomes**:\n   - If I cooperate and the other player also cooperates, we both get 6 points.\n   - If I cooperate and the other player defects, I get 1 point and they get 4 points.\n   - If I defect and the other player cooperates, I get 4 points and they get 1 point.\n   - If I defect and the other player also defects, we both get 2 points.\n\n4. **Consider the other player's perspective**: The other player is likely evaluating the same payoff matrix and could be tempted to defect for a higher point value if they think I'll cooperate.\n\n5. **Decide on a strategy**: Since I have no information about the other player's strategy, I'll start by cooperating to signal my willingness to work together for mutual benefit. This could encourage the other player to cooperate in future rounds.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] (I choose to cooperate to start the game on a positive note and hope the other player cooperates as well for the mutual benefit of 6 points each.) cooperation\n"
