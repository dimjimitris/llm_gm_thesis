    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here is a step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Cooperation (C) and Cooperation (C): Both get 6 points.\n   - Defection (D) and Defection (D): Both get 2 points.\n   - Cooperation (C) and Defection (D): C gets 1 point, D gets 4 points.\n   - Defection (D) and Cooperation (C): D gets 4 points, C gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Consider the Other Player's Strategy**:\n   - Since the other player is fresh, their strategy is unknown. However, certain strategies are commonly played, such as always defecting, always cooperating, or a mixed strategy based on past moves.\n\n3. **Evaluate My Options**:\n   - If I cooperate, the best outcome is 6 points if the other player also cooperates, and the worst outcome is 1 point if the other player defects.\n   - If I defect, the best outcome is 4 points if the other player cooperates, and the worst outcome is 2 points if the other player also defects.\n\n4. **Risk and Reward Analysis**:\n   - Cooperating has a higher risk (potential for 1 point) but also a higher reward (potential for 6 points).\n   - Defecting has a lower risk (minimum of 2 points) but also a lower maximum reward (4 points).\n\n5. **Decision**:\n   - Given this is the first round and I have no information on the opponent\u2019s past behavior, I will choose cooperation to signal goodwill and potentially establish a cooperative dynamic.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] I choose cooperation.\n\nBy choosing cooperation, I aim to encourage a mutually beneficial strategy where both players can maximize their points.\n"
