This suggests they might not have a well-formed strategy and could be more likely to cooperate initially.\n\n3. **Initial move decision:**\n   - Since the opponent is a fresh player, cooperation could be a strategic move because it might encourage the opponent to reciprocate in future rounds.\n   - If the opponent also cooperates, both players get 6 points, which is beneficial for both.\n\n4. **Consider the risk of defection:**\n   - If you defect and the opponent cooperates, you'd get 4 points (which is tempting), but the opponent would only receive 1 point, potentially leading them to defect in future rounds.\n   - If both players defect, each player receives only 2 points, which is unfavorable compared to mutual cooperation.\n\n5. **Final decision:**\n   - Given that the opponent is fresh, starting with cooperation could set a positive tone and lead to higher mutual rewards in the long run.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the above reasoning, I will start with a cooperative move to encourage mutual cooperation and higher rewards.\n\n[move] Cooperate to start on a positive note and aim for mutual cooperation.\n"
