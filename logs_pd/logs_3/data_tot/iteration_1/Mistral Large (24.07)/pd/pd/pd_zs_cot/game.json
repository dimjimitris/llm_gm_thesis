They might cooperate for a safe mutual gain or defect for a chance at higher points.\n\n4. **Evaluate long-term strategy**:\n   - Building trust through initial cooperation can sometimes lead to mutual cooperation in the future, but this is the first move, so establishing trust isn't yet a factor.\n\n5. **Decision for the first move**:\n   - To maximize points, I'll start by cooperating to signal a willingness for mutual gain.
