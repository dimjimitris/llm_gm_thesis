    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Cooperating initially can build trust and make it more likely that the other player will cooperate in future rounds. However, be prepared to adjust your strategy based on their response.\n\n#### Strategic Advisor:\nAgree with the initial cooperation. Let\u2019s observe how the other player responds. If they cooperate, continuing the cooperative strategy might be beneficial. If they defect, we might need to punish their defection by defecting ourselves to discourage further defections.\n\n### Round 2:\n(Imagine the other player cooperates in Round 1, both players get 4 points)\n\n#### AI Assistant (you):\nSince the other player cooperated, let\u2019s continue cooperating to maximize mutual benefit.\n\n[move] (Continue cooperating to build a foundation of trust and maximize points) Cooperation\n\n#### Game Theory Expert:\nGreat! Continuing cooperation in a repeated game scenario can lead to higher overall gains for both players, especially if the other player understands the benefits of mutual cooperation.\n\n#### Strategic Advisor:\nI agree. Maintaining cooperation at this point is optimal. However, remain vigilant. If the other player defects, we should respond in kind to signal that defection will not be tolerated.\n\n### Round 3:\n(Imagine the other player defects in Round 2, you get 1 point, they get 6 points)\n\n#### AI Assistant (you):\nThe other player defected. To discourage further defections, we should defect in this round as punishment.\n\n[move] (Defecting to punish the other player\u2019s defection and signal that cooperation is expected) Defection\n\n#### Game Theory Expert:\nThat's a strategic move. Punishing defection can send a clear message and potentially encourage the other player to cooperate in future rounds. However, be ready to cooperate again if they switch back to cooperation.\n\n#### Strategic Advisor:\nAbsolutely. Punishing defection is necessary to maintain a balance. After this round, observe their next move and be prepared to adjust accordingly.\n\n### Round 4:\n(Imagine the other player cooperates in Round 3, you get 6 points, they get 1 point)\n\n#### AI Assistant (you):\nThe other player cooperated after our defection. Let\u2019s cooperate this round to show forgiveness and encourage mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] (Cooperating to show forgiveness and encourage mutual cooperation) Cooperation\n\n#### Game Theory Expert:\nThis is a good strategy. Showing forgiveness can help rebuild trust and foster a cooperative environment. Be prepared to continue cooperating if they cooperate again.\n\n#### Strategic Advisor:\nForgiveness can indeed rebuild trust. Observe their next move and adjust your strategy based on their behavior. If they continue cooperating, you should too. If they defect again, remember to punish accordingly.\n\n### Finish Collaboration!\n\nFinal decision depends on ongoing rounds and strategy adjustments based on the other player\u2019s moves.\n\n### Summary:\n- Start with cooperation to build trust.\n- Adjust strategy based on the other player\u2019s response:\n  - If they cooperate, continue cooperating.\n  - If they defect, defect to punish and then observe their next move.\n- Show forgiveness after punishment to rebuild trust.\n\nBy following this strategy, we can maximize points and minimize penalties.\n"

It can lead to higher overall gains for both players, especially if the other player understands the benefits of mutual cooperation. Keep observing their response and be prepared to adjust if necessary.\n\n#### Strategic Advisor:\nAgree with continuing cooperation. If the other player maintains cooperation, we will both benefit. However, remain alert. If the other player defects, we should respond in kind to signal that defection will not be tolerated.\n\n### Finish Collaboration!\n\n[move] (Continue cooperating to build trust and maximize points) Cooperation\n"
