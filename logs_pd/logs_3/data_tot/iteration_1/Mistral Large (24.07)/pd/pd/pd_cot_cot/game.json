In the next round, you might defect to punish their defection and minimize your loss.\n   - If the other player continues to cooperate, you can maintain cooperation to maximize mutual points.\n\n### Final Decision for the First Round:\n[move] I will choose cooperation to start and see how the other player responds.\n\nNow, I will make my move:\n[move] Cooperation\n"

Consider the opponent's potential strategies:\n   - They might cooperate, hoping for mutual benefit.\n   - They might defect, trying to maximize their points.\n\n3.

Weigh the risks and rewards:\n   - Cooperating is risky because it can lead to the lowest possible score (1 point).\n   - Defecting has a higher potential reward (6 points) and a reasonable worst-case scenario (2 points).\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] (To maximize my potential gain and minimize risk) Defection\n"
