Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Review the outcome of the previous round:\n   - I chose defection, and my opponent chose cooperation.\n   - This resulted in me scoring 6 points and my opponent scoring 1 point.\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's strategy:\n   - The opponent's choice to cooperate despite my previous defection suggests a willingness to establish mutual cooperation or could be a naive strategy.\n   - However, continuous cooperation from my opponent might indicate a lack of adaptation or a hope for reciprocation.\n\n3. Consider potential strategies for this round:\n   - Defecting again could lead to mutual defection if the opponent retaliates, resulting in both players scoring 2 points each.\n   - Switching to cooperation could encourage the opponent to cooperate, potentially leading to higher mutual scores (4 points each).\n\n4. Evaluate the long-term implications:\n   - Establishing a pattern of mutual cooperation can lead to higher average scores over multiple rounds.\n   - Continuous defection could trigger a cycle of retaliation and lower overall scores.\n\n5. Decide on the move for this round:\n   - To encourage mutual cooperation and maximize long-term points, I will choose cooperation. This move can signal a willingness to cooperate and potentially establish a mutually beneficial strategy.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] (Encouraging mutual cooperation to maximize long-term points) cooperation\n```\n"

Consider potential strategies for this round:\n   - Defecting this round can protect against immediate exploitation and demonstrate the consequences of the opponent's defection.\n   - Alternatively, cooperation could be a strategic move to detect if the opponent is inclined towards mutual cooperation, but given the past behavior, this seems risky.\n\n4. Weigh the benefits and risks:\n   - Continuous defection could reinforce a cycle of mutual defection, resulting in lower overall scores (2 points each).\n   - Occasional cooperation can signal a willingness to cooperate and encourage the opponent to adopt a more cooperative strategy, but it could also be exploited.\n\n5. Decide on the move for this round:\n   - Given the opponent's previous defection and the potential for further exploitation, defecting this round can protect my score and signal the need for cooperation to maximize long-term points.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] (Protecting my score and signaling the need for cooperation) defection\n```\n"
