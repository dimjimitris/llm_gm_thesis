    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Game Strategist\n\nLet's start the collaboration process.\n\n---\n\nGame Strategist: Given that this is a new player you are facing, it's crucial to think through your initial move carefully. The key is to balance the risk of choosing stag with the reward potential of choosing hare. Stag offers higher mutual reward if both players choose it but carries a significant risk if the other player chooses hare. Choosing hare can yield a moderate reward if you can anticipate the other player choosing stag but comes with less reward if both choose hare.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thank you for the strategic overview. Considering the payoff matrix, if I choose stag and the other player also chooses stag, we both get 6 points. If I choose hare and the other player chooses stag, I get 4 points. Given that the opponent is a fresh player, they might be risk-averse and likely to choose hare to start safe. Therefore, I plan to choose stag hoping to catch the opponent in a risk-averse move.\n\nGame Strategist: That's a solid plan. Choosing stag in the first round can serve as a test for the other player's strategy. If the opponent is risk-averse and chooses hare, you get 1 point but establish a baseline for future rounds. If they choose stag as well, you both get a high reward of 6 points immediately. Let's proceed with your decision.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Very well, here is my move:\n[move] I choose stag to test the opponent's strategy and potentially gain high mutual reward.\n\n---\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: [move] I choose stag to test the opponent's strategy and potentially gain high mutual reward.\n"

If both choose stag, both get 6 points. If both choose hare, both get 2 points. If one chooses stag and the other chooses hare, the stag chooser gets 1 point, and the hare chooser gets 4 points. We need to strategize based on these payoffs.\n\nPsychologist: Considering the opponent is a fresh player, they might adopt a risk-averse strategy initially. This means they might choose hare to secure a moderate reward rather than risking the lower reward of choosing stag if the other player chooses hare.\n\nMathematics Expert: To maximize points, you should aim for the high mutual reward scenario where both players choose stag. However, if the opponent is risk-averse, this might not be feasible initially. Analyze the possible outcomes and choose accordingly.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thank you for the detailed insights. Given the payoff matrix and the opponent's potential risk-averse behavior, choosing stag initially is strategic. If the opponent chooses hare, I get 1 point but set a baseline for future rounds.

We need to decide whether to continue with stag or switch to hare.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a mutual cooperative choice like stag, it's likely the other player will continue this strategy, especially if they want to maximize mutual reward. However, this could also be a strategy to lull you into a false sense of security before switching to hare.\n\nMathematics Expert: Let's review the payoff matrix again:\n- If both choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- If both choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- If you choose stag and the other chooses hare, you get 1 point and they get 4 points.\n- If you choose hare and the other chooses stag, you get 4 points and they get 1 point.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the detailed analysis.
