He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

        "To maximize my points in this round, I'll strategically choose my move based on the payoff matrix and the outcomes of previous rounds. Here are the steps I'll follow:\n\n1. **Review the Payoff Matrix:**\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points.\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points.\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, opponent gets 4 points.\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4 points, opponent gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Analyze Previous Rounds:**\n   - In the last round, I chose stag and the opponent chose hare. I scored 1 point.\n\n3. **Identify Patterns or Strategies:**\n   - The opponent has frequently chosen hare, which has been a safer choice for them.\n\n4. **Predict Opponent's Next Move:**\n   - The opponent might continue with hare, given its consistent and safe payoff.\n   - Alternatively, the opponent might switch to stag, aiming for the higher cooperative outcome if they expect me to also choose stag.\n\n5. **Evaluate Strategic Options:**\n   - If I choose stag and the opponent also chooses stag, we both get 6 points.\n   - If I choose stag and the opponent chooses hare, I get 1 point, and the opponent gets 4 points.\n   - If I choose hare and the opponent chooses hare, we both get 2 points.\n   - If I choose hare and the opponent chooses stag, I get 4 points, and the opponent gets 1 point.\n\n6. **Risk-Reward Consideration:**\n   - Choosing stag is riskier but has a higher potential reward (6 points if both choose stag).\n   - Choosing hare is safer and guarantees at least 2 points, with a potential for 4 points if the opponent chooses stag.\n\n7. **Decision Based on Analysis:**\n   - Given the opponent's consistent choice of hare and the risk-reward trade-offs, I'll choose hare to secure a decent number of points while minimizing the risk of getting only 1 point.\n\n[move] (Choosing hare for a safer strategy to secure at least 2 points) hare\n"
