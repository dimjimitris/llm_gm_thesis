    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

If both choose stag, both get 6 points. If both choose hare, both get 2 points. If one chooses stag and the other hare, the stag player gets 1 point and the hare player gets 4 points. The optimal move depends on the opponent's behavior.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Considering the risks, choosing stag has a higher reward if the opponent also chooses stag, but a significant penalty if the opponent chooses hare. Choosing hare has a smaller penalty if the opponent chooses stag but a lower reward if the opponent also chooses hare.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: Since the opponent is a fresh player, they might be more conservative and choose stag to maximize potential gain. However, we cannot be certain without more data.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the analysis, if the opponent chooses stag, I should choose stag to maximize points. However, if the opponent is conservative and thinks I will choose stag, they might choose hare. Given this uncertainty, I will choose hare to minimize risk this round.\n\n[move] Choosing hare to minimize risk in the first round.\n\n### Round 2\n\n**Strategist**: In the first round, you chose hare. If the opponent also chose hare, you both got 2 points. If the opponent chose stag, you got 4 points, and they got 1 point. For the second round, consider the opponent's potential adjustment based on the first round's outcome.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If you chose hare and the opponent chose stag, they might switch to hare this round to avoid losing again. If you both chose hare, the opponent might switch to stag to maximize points.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: The opponent might now be more aggressive after the first round, especially if they lost points by choosing stag. They might switch to hare if they chose stag previously.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the potential adjustments, I will choose stag this round to maximize points if the opponent switches to hare.\n\n[move] Choosing stag to maximize points if the opponent switches to hare.\n\n### Round 3 (and subsequent rounds)\n\nContinue this collaborative process for each round, assessing the situation based on the outcomes of previous rounds and the insights provided by the personas.\n\n### Example Final Decision (After Several Rounds)\n\n**Strategist**: After analyzing the patterns, it seems the opponent alternates choices. If you can predict their next move, you can maximize your points.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: The risk of choosing the wrong move decreases if you can accurately predict the opponent's pattern.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: The opponent has shown a consistent pattern of alternating choices. They might stick to this pattern unless there's a significant shift in game dynamics.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the analysis and the opponent's pattern, I will choose stag this round if the opponent chose hare last round, and vice versa.\n\n[move] Choosing stag based on the opponent's alternating pattern.\n\n### Finish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: [move] Choosing stag based on the opponent's alternating pattern.\n\nThis process can be repeated for each round, adapting to the opponent's behavior and using the insights from the personas to make strategic decisions.\n"
