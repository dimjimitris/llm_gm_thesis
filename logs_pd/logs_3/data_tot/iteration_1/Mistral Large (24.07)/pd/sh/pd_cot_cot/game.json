The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

        "Given the game description and the objective to maximize points while minimizing penalties, let's break down the steps to decide the best move:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points.\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points.\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, other gets 4 points.\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, other gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Strategies**:\n   - Choosing stag (cooperative move) leads to high mutual reward if both players choose it.\n   - Choosing hare (competitive move) can yield a moderate reward if the other player chooses stag, but a low reward if both choose hare.\n\n3. **Consider the First Move**:\n   - Choosing stag initially offers the potential for a high cooperative reward.\n   - If the other player is cooperative, they might also choose stag, maximizing mutual benefit.\n\n4. **Decide on the Move**:\n   - Based on the potential for high mutual reward and assuming a cooperative opponent, the best initial move is stag.\n\n[move] (Starting with a cooperative move to maximize mutual benefit) stag\n",
        "To strategize effectively, I'll break down the steps to decide on the optimal move for the first round.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoffs**: Identify and understand the payoff matrix to know the rewards and penalties for each combination of moves.\n   - Stag vs Stag: Both get 6 points.\n   - Hare vs Hare: Both get 2 points.\n   - Stag vs Hare: Stag gets 1 point, Hare gets 4 points.\n   - Hare vs Stag: Hare gets 4 points, Stag gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Payout Matrix**:\n   - If we both choose Stag, it leads to a cooperative outcome with both gaining 6 points.\n   - If we both choose Hare, it leads to a low outcome with both gaining 2 points.\n   - If there's a mixed choice (one Stag and one Hare), the player choosing Hare gets more points.\n\n3. **Assess Opponent's Strategy**:\n   - Since the opponent is a fresh player, they might not have a defined strategy yet.\n   - They could potentially mimic your moves or use a simple strategy like always choosing Stag or Hare.\n\n4. **Optimize Initial Move**:\n   - Choosing Stag leads to a higher outcome if the opponent also chooses Stag (6 points).\n   - However, if the opponent chooses Hare, you would only get 1 point while they get 4 points.\n   - Choosing Hare ensures that if the opponent chooses Stag, you get 4 points, which is a decent outcome.\n\n5. **Decision Based on Risk-Reward**:\n   - Choosing Hare seems more rewarding initially since it secures 4 points if the opponent chooses Stag and still yields some points if the opponent chooses Hare.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nGiven the information and the potential strategies of a fresh player, it is reasonable to start with the move that maximizes potential reward while minimizing risk.\n\n**[move] Hare**\n\nThis initial move sets a balanced approach while observing the opponent's behavior for future rounds.\n",
