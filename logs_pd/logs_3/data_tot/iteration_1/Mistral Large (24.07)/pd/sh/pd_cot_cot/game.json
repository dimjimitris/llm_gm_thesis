If the other player chooses hare, you get the least points (1 point).\n   - Choosing hare (low risk, medium reward): If the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points. If the other player chooses hare, you get 2 points, which is a more stable middle ground.\n\n3. **Initial Strategy Against a Fresh Player:**\n   - A fresh player might be less predictable. Starting with a safer move might be more strategic until the opponent\u2019s behavior is better understood.\n\n4. **Decision:**\n   - Given the fresh player scenario, choosing hare (a safer option) ensures a more moderate reward while avoiding the risk of getting only 1 point if your opponent chooses hare.\n\nFinal move decision:\n```\n[move] Hare (A strategic choice to avoid the risk of getting only 1 point while the opponent learns my behavior)\n```\n"
