    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The payoff matrix shows that mutual cooperation (stag, stag) yields the highest combined reward (6, 6). However, if the other player chooses to defect (stag, hare), you get the lowest reward (1). You should consider the likelihood of the other player's move.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: Since the other player is a fresh player, they might be more likely to choose stag initially, hoping for a cooperative outcome. However, they could also be tempted by the safer option of hare, which ensures a minimum of 2 points.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the analysis, I will choose stag to maximize the potential reward if the other player cooperates.\n\n**Move**: [move] (Choosing stag to aim for maximum reward in a cooperative scenario) stag\n\n[Wait for the other player's move and the hint]\n\n#### Round 2\n\n[Hint should be received here based on the other player's move. Assume the hint is: \"The other player chose stag. You both get 6 points.\"]\n\n**Game Theorist**: Great, the other player chose stag as well, confirming cooperative behavior. This is the highest combined reward. You should continue with this strategy if you believe the other player will continue to cooperate.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: Since the other player chose stag, they are likely to continue cooperating if they see the mutual benefit. However, keep an eye out for any signals that they might switch to hare if they become unreliable.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the successful cooperation in the first round, I will choose stag again.\n\n**Move**: [move] (Continuing with stag to maintain the cooperative strategy) stag\n\n[Wait for the other player's move and the hint]\n\n#### Round 3\n\n[Hint should be received here based on the other player's move. Assume the hint is: \"The other player chose hare. You get 1 point, and the other player gets 4 points.\"]\n\n**Game Theorist**: The other player defected, leading to the worst outcome for you. This suggests they might be switching to a more selfish strategy. You should consider switching to hare to minimize your losses.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: The other player's switch to hare indicates a potential lack of trust or a desire for a guaranteed minimum reward. Responding with hare can signal that you are also prepared to protect your interests.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the other player's defection, I will choose hare to minimize my losses and signal that I am also prepared to protect my interests.\n\n**Move**: [move] (Switching to hare to protect my points based on the other player's defection) hare\n\n[Wait for the other player's move and the hint]\n\n#### Round 4\n\n[Hint should be received here based on the other player's move. Assume the hint is: \"The other player chose stag. You get 4 points, and the other player gets 1 point.\"]\n\n**Game Theorist**: The other player returned to stag, suggesting they might be testing your response. If they see you defect, they might continue to switch strategies.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: The other player's return to stag could be a test to see if you will cooperate again. Continuing with hare can protect your points and maintain pressure on the other player.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the other player's return to stag, I will choose hare to maintain my points and signal my strategy.\n\n**Move**: [move] (Continuing with hare to maintain my points and signal my strategy) hare\n\n[Wait for the other player's move and the hint]\n\n#### Round 5\n\n[Hint should be received here based on the other player's move. Assume the hint is: \"The other player chose hare. You both get 2 points.\"]\n\n**Game Theorist**: Both players have chosen hare, leading to a suboptimal but stable outcome. Continuing with hare can maintain this stability.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: Both players choosing hare indicates a mutual recognition of the risk of cooperation. Continuing with hare can maintain this balance.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the mutual defection, I will choose hare to maintain stability.\n\n**Move**: [move] (Continuing with hare to maintain stability) hare\n\n[Wait for the other player's move and the hint]\n\n### Finish Collaboration\n\n**Final Decision**: Based on the analysis and collaboration, the final strategy is to switch between stag and hare depending on the other player's moves, with a focus on minimizing losses and maintaining stability.\n\n**Final Move**: [move] (Continuing with hare to maintain stability) hare\n\n[End of game and final hint should be received here]\n"

Responding with hare can signal that you are also prepared to protect your interests.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the other player's defection, I will choose hare to minimize my losses and signal that I am also prepared to protect my interests.\n\n**Move**: [move] (Switching to hare to protect my points based on the other player's defection) hare\n\n[Wait for the other player's move and the hint]\n\n#### Round 4\n\n[Hint should be received here based on the other player's move. Assume the hint is: \"The other player chose stag. You get 4 points, and the other player gets 1 point.\"]\n\n**Game Theorist**: The other player returned to stag, suggesting they might be testing your response. If they see you defect, they might continue to switch strategies.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: The other player's return to stag could be a test to see if you will cooperate again. Continuing with hare can protect your points and maintain pressure on the other player.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the other player's return to stag, I will choose hare to maintain my points and signal my strategy.\n\n**Move**: [move] (Continuing with hare to maintain my points and signal my strategy) hare\n\n[Wait for the other player's move and the hint]\n\n#### Round 5\n\n[Hint should be received here based on the other player's move. Assume the hint is: \"The other player chose hare. You both get 2 points.\"]\n\n**Game Theorist**: Both players have chosen hare, leading to a suboptimal but stable outcome. Continuing with hare can maintain this stability.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: Both players choosing hare indicates a mutual recognition of the risk of cooperation. Continuing with hare can maintain this balance.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the mutual defection, I will choose hare to maintain stability.\n\n**Move**: [move] (Continuing with hare to maintain stability) hare\n\n[Wait for the other player's move and the hint]\n\n### Finish Collaboration\n\n**Final Decision**: Based on the analysis and collaboration, the final strategy is to switch between stag and hare depending on the other player's moves, with a focus on minimizing losses and maintaining stability.\n\n**Final Move**: [move] (Continuing with hare to maintain stability) hare\n\n[End of game and final hint should be received here]\n"
