This might indicate they don't have a defined strategy yet.\n\n3. **Risks and Gains**:\n    - Choosing stag (6-6) is a cooperative move. It has the highest combined payoff if both choose stag (12 points total).\n    - Choosing hare (2-2) is a safer move with low payoff.\n    - Mismatch gives high payoff to hare (4) and low to stag (1), a riskier strategy.\n\n4. **Initial Move**:\n    - Since the player is new, starting with a cooperative move (stag) could set a positive tone and encourage mutual cooperation.\n    - However, choosing hare at the beginning might give higher rewards (6 vs. 4) if the opponent is greedy.\n\nGiven these steps, for the first round, I'll play cooperatively to set a good standard.\n\n[move] Choosing stag to encourage cooperation and maximize mutual benefit. Let's see how the opponent responds.\n\nFinal decision: stag\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

        "Alright, let's begin by outlining the steps to make a strategic move in this game.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points.\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points.\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, opponent gets 4 points.\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4 points, opponent gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Evaluate Risk and Reward**:\n   - Choosing stag (6-6) is a cooperative move with the highest combined payoff.\n   - Choosing hare (2-2) is a safer move with a guaranteed lower payoff.\n   - Mismatch gives an advantage to the player choosing hare (4 points vs. 1 point), making it tempting but risky.\n\n3. **Consider Opponent Strategy**:\n   - Without knowledge of the opponent's strategy, starting with a cooperative move (stag) might encourage mutual cooperation.\n   - Risk-averse players may choose hare to avoid the low payoff of a mismatch.\n\n4. **Decision Making**:\n   - Since the opponent's strategy is unknown, starting with stag sets a cooperative tone.\n   - Future moves can be adapted based on the opponent's response.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] (Encouraging mutual cooperation to maximize points) stag\n",
        "Alright, let's strategize step-by-step for the game where the objective is to maximize points.\n\n### Steps to Decide My Move:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points.\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points.\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, other gets 4 points.\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4 points, other gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Analyze Best Outcomes**:\n   - The best mutual outcome is both choosing stag (6 points each).\n   - The best individual outcome for me is choosing hare while the opponent chooses stag (4 points for me).\n\n3. **Consider Opponent's Motivation**:\n   - The opponent also wants to maximize their points. They might aim for the mutual stag outcome or try to exploit by choosing hare if they think I'll choose stag.\n\n4. **First Move Strategy**:\n   - I should start by choosing stag. This shows cooperation and aims for the highest mutual reward.\n\n5. **Adapt Based on Opponent's Move**:\n   - If the opponent chooses stag, we both gain significantly.\n   - If the opponent chooses hare, I'll adapt in subsequent rounds to possibly choose hare to maximize my points.\n\n### Move:\n[move] (Starting with cooperation to aim for the highest mutual benefit) stag\n",
        "Sure, let's think through this strategically.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix:**\n   - If both choose stag: both get 6 points.\n   - If both choose hare: both get 2 points.\n   - If you choose stag and the other chooses hare: you get 1 point, the other gets 4 points.\n   - If you choose hare and the other chooses stag: you get 4 points, the other gets 1 point.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Rewards and Risks:**\n   - Choosing stag offers the highest mutual reward (6 points for both), but comes with the risk of getting the lowest reward (1 point) if the other player chooses hare.\n   - Choosing hare offers a safer outcome with a middle-ground reward (2 points if both choose hare or 4 points if the other chooses stag).\n\n3. **Consider Potential Strategies of the Other Player:**\n   - Without knowing the other player's strategy, a conservative approach might be to choose hare as it minimizes downside risk.\n   - If there's any indication that the other player might be cooperative or likely to choose stag, choosing stag could yield a higher reward.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nGiven the potential for a significant penalty if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, a safer initial move is to choose hare. This ensures a moderate reward regardless of the other player's choice.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n`[move] (Choosing hare to minimize downside risk and ensure a moderate reward) hare`\n"
