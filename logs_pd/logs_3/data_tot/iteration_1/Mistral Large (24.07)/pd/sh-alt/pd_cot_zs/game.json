They might either choose conservatively (Hare) or aim for mutual benefit (Stag).\n\n5. **Final Move Decision**:\n   - Given the risk-reward analysis, choosing **Hare** is more advantageous initially due to its higher potential gain and lower risk of low points.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] Choosing **Hare** as it provides a higher minimum reward (2 points) and an opportunity for a significant gain (6 points) if the opponent chooses Stag.\n\n---\n\nLet's go with the move:\n\n[move] Hare (Strategic choice to minimize risk and maximize potential gain)\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
