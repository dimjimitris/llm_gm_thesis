Evaluate the best possible outcomes based on the other player's potential moves:\n   - If the other player chooses Stag: Choosing Hare will yield 6 points, while choosing Stag will yield 4 points.\n   - If the other player chooses Hare: Choosing Stag will yield 1 point, while choosing Hare will yield 2 points.\n\n3. Consider the risk-reward ratio:\n   - Choosing Stag has a higher guaranteed minimum point (4 if both choose Stag) but a lower maximum point (1 if the other chooses Hare).\n   - Choosing Hare has a lower guaranteed minimum point (2 if both choose Hare) but a higher maximum point (6 if the other chooses Stag).\n\n4. Assess the likelihood of the other player's move:\n   - A fresh player might be more inclined to choose Stag to maximize the guaranteed minimum points.\n\n5.
