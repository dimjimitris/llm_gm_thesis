They might not have a established strategy yet.\n\n3. **Develop a Strategy:**\n   - Choosing hare is risky but can yield high rewards (6 points) if the opponent chooses stag.\n   - Choosing stag is safer and guarantees at least 1 point, but could lose out on the high reward.\n\n4. **Initial Move:**\n   - Since the opponent is fresh, they might be more likely to choose stag as a safe option.\n   - Therefore, choosing hare could potentially yield 6 points.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] I choose hare to potentially maximize my points, assuming the fresh player might choose stag as a safe option.\n"

However, understanding common behaviors in games can help.\n\n3. **Develop a Strategy:**\n   - Choosing stag is a safer move but yields a lower reward if the opponent chooses hare.\n   - Choosing hare is riskier but can yield a high reward if the opponent chooses stag.\n\n4. **Evaluate Risk and Reward:**\n   - Stag: Guarantees at least 1 point, with a potential for 4 points.\n   - Hare: Could result in 2 points if both choose it, but offers 6 points if the opponent chooses stag.\n\n5. **Consider the Best Outcome:**\n   - Assuming the opponent might be conservative and choose stag, choosing hare maximizes potential points.\n\n### Decision:\n\n[move] (Maximizing potential reward by assuming the opponent might choose stag) hare\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
