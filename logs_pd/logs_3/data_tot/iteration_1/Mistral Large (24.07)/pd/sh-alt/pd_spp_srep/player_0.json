    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

The payoff matrix indicates that \"stag\" is a high-risk, high-reward move, while \"hare\" is a safer but lower reward move. Since we are playing against a fresh player, we should consider their potential strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: We should weigh the risks and benefits. Choosing \"stag\" can give us big rewards if the other player also chooses \"stag,\" but a big loss if they choose \"hare.\" Choosing \"hare,\" on the other hand, ensures we get at least 2 points regardless of the opponent's move.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the insights. Since the opponent is new, they might be cautious and choose \"hare\" to secure some points. To maximize our points, let's choose \"stag\" and hope they choose \"hare.\" This gives us a chance at 6 points.\n\nRisk Analyst: Keep in mind that this is a high-risk move. If they choose \"stag\" as well, we will both get 4 points, which is still a decent outcome.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with your strategy for this round. Let's go with \"stag\" and see how the opponent reacts. This will give us a better understanding of their strategy for future rounds.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Final decision for this round:\n```[move] Since the opponent is new and might be cautious, choosing \"stag\" gives us a chance at 6 points.

We need to consider the payoff matrix and the behavior of the other player. Remember, the goal is to maximize our points.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at the payoff matrix, \"stag\" is a high-risk, high-reward move, while \"hare\" is a safer but lower reward move. If we both choose \"stag,\" we each get 4 points, but if one chooses \"stag\" and the other \"hare,\" the one choosing \"hare\" gets 6 points while the other gets 1 point.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the analysis. Given this setup, it's crucial to anticipate the opponent's strategy. If we both choose \"stag,\" we both benefit moderately. If we both choose \"hare,\" we both get fewer points. If we choose differently, one of us significantly benefits while the other gets penalized.\n\nGame Strategist: Considering the opponent is new, they might be cautious and go for \"hare\" to secure some points. However, if we think they might choose \"hare,\" we could take a risk and choose \"stag\" to potentially get 6 points.\n\nRisk Analyst: We should weigh our options carefully. Choosing \"stag\" gives us a chance at a high reward, but if the opponent also chooses \"stag,\" we both get a moderate reward. Choosing \"hare\" is safer and guarantees some points.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given the opponent's potential strategy and our goal to maximize points, let's choose \"stag\" for the first round. This gives us a chance at 6 points if the opponent chooses \"hare\" and a decent fallback of 4 points if they also choose \"stag.\"\n\nRisk Analyst: Remember, this is a high-risk move. If the opponent also chooses \"stag,\" our gain is reduced but still reliable. Proceed with caution.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the decision. Choosing \"stag\" allows us to test the opponent's strategy while potentially maximizing our points.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Final decision for this round:\n```[move] (Given the opponent's potential cautious strategy, choosing \"stag\" gives us a chance at 6 points if they choose \"hare,\" and a decent fallback of 4 points if they also choose \"stag.\") stag```\n"

Our opponent seems to have chosen \"hare,\" which is a safer, low-reward move. We need to adapt our strategy based on this information.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the analysis. Since the opponent chose \"hare\" last time, they might continue with that strategy to secure points. Alternatively, they might switch to \"stag\" expecting us to choose \"hare.\" We need to consider both possibilities.\n\nGame Strategist: It's a strategic game, so we should think about the opponent's potential responses.

This indicates that our strategy needs adjustment.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the payoff matrix, choosing \"stag\" is a high-risk, high-reward move. The opponent's repeated choice of \"hare\" suggests they are playing it safe to secure points. We need to adapt based on this pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the insights. Since the opponent has chosen \"hare\" consistently, they might continue with this safe strategy. Alternatively, they might switch to \"stag,\" expecting us to choose \"hare\" next.\n\nGame Strategist: If the opponent continues with \"hare,\" choosing \"stag\" will again give us only 1 point. If they switch to \"stag,\" choosing \"hare\" would give us 6 points. This is a crucial strategic consideration.\n\nRisk Analyst: Choosing \"hare\" ensures we get at least 2 points regardless of the opponent's move. While it's a safer choice, it limits our potential for higher rewards. Choosing \"stag\" is riskier, but if we both choose \"stag,\" we get 4 points each.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Considering the opponent's consistent choice of \"hare,\" let's choose \"hare\" this round.
