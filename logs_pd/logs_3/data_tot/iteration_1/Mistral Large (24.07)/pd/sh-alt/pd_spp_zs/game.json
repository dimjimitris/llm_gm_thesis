Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

        "**Personas**: AI Assistant (you); Game Strategist; Psychologist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's review the payoff matrix. If both players choose stag, each gets 4 points. If both choose hare, each gets 2 points. If one chooses stag and the other hare, the stag player gets 1 point, and the hare player gets 6 points. This is a classic stag hunt scenario where cooperation (both choosing stag) yields a good payoff, but there's a temptation to defect (choosing hare).\n\nPsychologist: Consider the opponent's mindset. They might initially choose stag to cooperate and avoid the risk of getting only 1 point if they choose hare and you choose stag. However, they might also be tempted by the high reward of choosing hare if they think you will choose stag.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the analysis. Given that this is the first move and we don't have information on the opponent's strategy yet, I'll opt for stag to signal cooperation and test their response.\n\nMove message: [move] (Signaling cooperation and testing the opponent's response) stag\n",

The goal is to maximize our points. Let's begin by assessing the payoffs and coming up with a strategy based on the context we have.\n\nGame Strategist: The stag hunt game has a collaborative aspect and a competitive one. Choosing \"stag\" yields a higher reward if both players choose it (4 points each), but carries risk if the other player chooses \"hare\" (1 point). Choosing \"hare\" is safer (2 points if both choose it), but yields a high reward if the other player chooses \"stag\" (6 points). against a fresh player with no history, it's wise to start cooperatively, as it can set a tone for future rounds.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Starting cooperatively is statistically sound. We should track the outcomes and adapt based on the opponent's moves. Cooperative moves might encourage reciprocity, which is beneficial in repeated games.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: In game theory, fresh players often respond positively to initial cooperative moves. It fosters trust and could lead to sustained cooperation. However, be prepared to adjust if the opponent exploits this.\n\nAI Assistant: Given the fresh player context and initial considerations, we'll start cooperatively.\n\n[move] (Starting cooperatively to foster trust and aim for higher combined points) stag\n",

If you switch to hare and the opponent chooses stag, you could gain 6 points but risk the opponent switching as well, which would yield only 2 points each.\n\nPsychologist: Given that the opponent also chose stag in the first round, they might continue to lean towards cooperation. However, they might also be tempted by the potential higher reward of choosing hare if they think you will stick with stag. It's crucial to balance risk and reward.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the analysis.
