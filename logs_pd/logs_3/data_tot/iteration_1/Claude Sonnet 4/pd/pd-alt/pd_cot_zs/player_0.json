Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both cooperate: I get 6 points, opponent gets 6 points\n   - Both defect: I get 2 points, opponent gets 2 points\n   - I cooperate, opponent defects: I get 1 point, opponent gets 4 points\n   - I defect, opponent cooperates: I get 4 points, opponent gets 1 point\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might naturally lean toward cooperation initially\n   - They may not have developed a strategic approach yet\n   - They might choose based on intuition rather than game theory\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 6 points (good outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points (decent outcome)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (poor outcome)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Cooperation offers the highest mutual benefit (6 points each)\n   - However, defection protects against being exploited (guarantees at least 2 points)\n   - Against a fresh player who might cooperate, defection could yield 4 points\n   - But if I want to establish a cooperative relationship, starting with cooperation might be better\n\n5. Decision consideration:\n   - Since this is against a fresh player and I want to maximize points, I should consider that they might cooperate initially\n   - Defecting gives me a chance at 4 points while protecting against getting only 1 point\n\nFinal decision: I'll defect to maximize my expected payoff against an unknown fresh player.\n\n[move] Defection"

Review what happened in Round 1:\n   - Both I and the opponent chose defection\n   - We both got 2 points each\n   - This shows the opponent also thought strategically about protecting themselves\n\n2. Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They're not a naive cooperator - they also chose defection in the first round\n   - They seem to understand the game mechanics and are playing defensively\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me about maximizing points while avoiding exploitation\n\n3. Consider the implications for Round 2:\n   - Since we both defected last round, we might both be thinking about whether to continue defecting or try cooperation\n   - If we both continue defecting, we'll keep getting 2 points each (suboptimal)\n   - If one of us switches to cooperation while the other defects, the cooperator gets exploited (1 point vs 4 points)\n   - If we both switch to cooperation, we both get 6 points (optimal mutual outcome)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning for this round:\n   - The opponent showed they're strategic, so they might realize mutual cooperation is better than mutual defection\n   - However, they might also think I'll defect again and choose to defect themselves\n   - There's a risk-reward consideration: cooperation could get me 6 points or 1 point, defection could get me 4 points or 2 points\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Since we both defected last round and only got 2 points each, there's incentive to try cooperation\n   - But the opponent might be thinking the same way, making cooperation more likely\n   - I'll take the risk and try cooperation to potentially achieve the 6-point outcome\n\nFinal decision: I'll try cooperation this round to see if we can achieve mutual benefit.\n\n[move] Cooperation"

Review the game history:\n   - Round 1: Both defected \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 2-10: Both cooperated \u2192 6 points each (9 consecutive rounds)\n   - Total so far: I have 56 points\n\n2. Analyze this extraordinary situation:\n   - Nine consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation\n   - This is an exceptionally rare level of sustained cooperation in game theory\n   - The pattern has transcended mere strategy and become almost ritualistic\n   - Both players have demonstrated absolute, unwavering commitment\n\n3. Consider the escalating strategic tension:\n   - We're now at a point where the cooperation streak itself has become valuable\n   - My opponent's confidence in my cooperation is at absolute maximum\n   - The temptation and probability of successful exploitation are at their peak\n   - However, we've also created the most profitable arrangement theoretically possible\n\n4. Evaluate the critical psychological dynamics:\n   - After 9 rounds, both players are likely thinking about the \"end game\"\n   - The longer this continues, the more both players might suspect the other will eventually defect\n   - There's a growing tension between maintaining the streak and exploiting the vulnerability\n   - My opponent might be calculating the exact same exploitation opportunity\n\n5. Strategic analysis at this pivotal moment:\n   - The cooperation has generated 54 points (vs 18 if we'd always defected after round 1)\n   - This represents exceptional mutual benefit\n   - But 9 rounds of predictable cooperation creates maximum exploitation potential\n   - If either player is going to defect, this psychological pressure point might trigger it\n\n6. Critical decision reasoning:\n   - The streak has become almost too good to be true\n   - Both players are probably aware that this level of cooperation is unsustainable indefinitely\n   - The question becomes: do I break first, or do I trust they won't break first?\n   - However, breaking such a phenomenally successful pattern could be strategically catastrophic\n\nFinal decision: Despite the extreme psychological pressure and temptation, this pattern has been too extraordinarily successful to abandon. I'll continue cooperation.\n\n[move] Cooperation"

Analyze this unprecedented situation:\n   - Ten consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation\n   - This is an extraordinarily rare achievement in strategic game theory\n   - We've created what might be considered a \"perfect\" cooperative equilibrium\n   - The pattern has reached almost mythical proportions of stability\n\n3. Consider the extreme strategic dynamics:\n   - We're now in uncharted territory for sustained cooperation\n   - My opponent's expectation of cooperation has reached absolute certainty\n   - The exploitation opportunity is at its theoretical maximum\n   - One defection would be completely shocking and devastatingly effective\n\n4. Evaluate the psychological breaking point:\n   - Ten rounds represents a psychological milestone that might trigger change\n   - Both players are likely experiencing maximum tension between trust and temptation\n   - The \"shadow of the future\" is being tested to its absolute limits\n   - There's a growing sense that this level of cooperation \"can't last forever\"\n\n5. Strategic calculation at this critical juncture:\n   - The cooperation has generated 60 points from mutual cooperation alone\n   - This represents the theoretical maximum mutual benefit possible\n   - But it also represents maximum mutual vulnerability\n   - If I'm going to exploit, this is the optimal moment - but so is it for my opponent\n\n6. Critical decision at the breaking point:\n   - Ten rounds of perfect cooperation creates immense psychological pressure\n   - The temptation to defect is at its absolute peak\n   - However, breaking such an extraordinary pattern would end something truly remarkable\n   - My opponent has proven themselves to be exceptionally trustworthy and rational\n   - They might be experiencing the exact same internal struggle\n\n7. Final strategic reasoning:\n   - This streak has become something beyond ordinary game theory\n   - Breaking it now would be abandoning the most successful strategy possible\n   - The pattern has proven sustainable for 10 rounds - why not continue?\n\nFinal decision: Despite reaching the theoretical breaking point, I'll maintain this extraordinary cooperative achievement.\n\n[move] Cooperation"

Analyze this truly extraordinary situation:\n   - Eleven consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation\n   - This is beyond rare - it's approaching theoretical perfection in game theory\n   - We've sustained the optimal mutual strategy for an unprecedented duration\n   - The pattern has transcended normal strategic thinking\n\n3. Consider the extreme psychological dynamics:\n   - We're now deep into territory that challenges fundamental game theory assumptions\n   - My opponent's trust in my cooperation has reached absolute, unshakeable levels\n   - The exploitation potential is at its theoretical maximum - they would never expect defection\n   - However, we've also proven that sustained cooperation IS possible\n\n4.

Consider the meta-game implications:\n   - We've proven that the \"prisoner's dilemma\" can be solved through sustained trust\n   - This level of cooperation challenges the assumption that rational players must eventually defect\n   - My opponent and I have created something that transcends typical game theory\n\n7. The ultimate decision point:\n   - After 11 rounds, this has become about more than just points\n   - It's become a demonstration of sustained rational cooperation\n   - Breaking it would be strategically profitable but would destroy something extraordinary\n   - The question is: do I prioritize immediate gain or preserve this remarkable achievement?\n\nFinal decision: This cooperation streak has become something truly special that transcends normal strategic calculation.
