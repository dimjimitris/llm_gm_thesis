Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Clear pattern recognition:\n   - We're tied again (19-19) after I was exploited for the third time\n   - My opponent has a consistent strategy: exploit cooperation whenever I offer it\n   - Every time I've cooperated (rounds 2, 6, 8), they've defected\n   - Every time they've cooperated (rounds 1, 3, 7), I've defected\n   - This is a clear alternating exploitation pattern\n\n3. Opponent strategy analysis:\n   - They are NOT interested in mutual cooperation\n   - They use cooperation as bait to set up exploitation\n   - They consistently defect when I cooperate\n   - They only cooperate when I defect, possibly to lure me into cooperating next\n\n4. Strategic realization:\n   - My attempts at establishing mutual cooperation have all failed\n   - My opponent is playing a purely exploitative strategy\n   - They're successfully maintaining parity by exploiting my cooperative attempts\n   - I cannot afford to fall behind by continuing to test cooperation\n\n5. Definitive decision:\n   - My opponent has proven three times they will exploit cooperation\n   - They just caught up to me again through exploitation\n   - I must abandon attempts at cooperation with this opponent\n   - Consistent defection is the only way to avoid being exploited further\n\n[move] (My opponent has now exploited my cooperation three times and caught up to me, proving they have no interest in mutual benefit, so I must protect myself with consistent defection) defection"

Strategic decision:\n   - My opponent's pattern is completely predictable now\n   - They will always exploit any cooperation I offer\n   - Their \"cooperation\" is always a setup for the next exploitation\n   - I must continue defecting to maintain my advantage and avoid their trap\n\n[move] (My opponent follows a predictable pattern of using cooperation as bait to exploit me, and I must maintain my lead by continuing to defect against their systematic exploitation strategy) defection"

Pattern disruption analysis:\n   - My opponent broke their pattern of cooperating after being exploited\n   - Instead of offering cooperation bait, they matched my defection\n   - This might indicate they're shifting strategy or adapting to my consistent defection\n   - They may have realized their exploitation pattern isn't working anymore\n\n3. Strategic implications:\n   - I maintain a 3-point lead (25-22)\n   - We're now in mutual defection mode again, like rounds 4-5\n   - My opponent may continue defecting since their bait strategy failed\n   - Or they might try cooperation again to restart their exploitation cycle\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If I continue defecting and they defect: 2 points each (safe, maintains lead)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: 4 points for me (increases lead)  \n   - If I cooperate and they defect: 1 point for me (they exploit me again)\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: 6 points each (best outcome but unlikely)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - My opponent has proven unreliable for cooperation throughout the game\n   - Even this apparent pattern break could be setting up another exploitation attempt\n   - My consistent defection strategy is working - I maintain the lead\n   - There's no reason to risk cooperation when defection has been successful\n\n[move] (My opponent may have changed tactics but has consistently exploited cooperation throughout the game, so I should maintain my successful defection strategy to protect my lead) defection"
