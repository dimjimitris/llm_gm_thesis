Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the clear exploitation pattern:\n   - The opponent has now exploited my cooperation THREE times (Rounds 2, 7, 9)\n   - They cooperate when I defect (giving me 4 points)\n   - They defect when I cooperate (giving themselves 4 points, me 1 point)\n   - This is a deliberate alternating exploitation strategy\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's tactical approach:\n   - They're playing a sophisticated \"bait and switch\" strategy\n   - Cooperate to lure me into cooperation, then immediately exploit it\n   - They're maximizing their advantage by timing their moves perfectly\n\n4. Evaluate what I've learned:\n   - Every single time I've tried cooperation, I've been exploited\n   - Every time I've defected after they cooperated, I got 4 points\n   - The opponent is NOT interested in mutual cooperation - they want to exploit\n\n5. Consider the likely next move:\n   - Based on the pattern, they might cooperate again to try to lure me\n   - If I cooperate, they'll almost certainly defect again\n   - If I defect, I'll either get 2 points (if they defect) or 4 points (if they cooperate)\n\n6. Strategic decision-making:\n   - I've been fooled three times by this same tactic\n   - The opponent has shown they will ALWAYS exploit cooperation\n   - I need to stop falling for this manipulation\n\n7. Final reasoning:\n   - This opponent is playing pure exploitation with no genuine cooperation intent\n   - I must protect myself and stop giving them easy wins\n   - Defection is the only rational response to this pattern\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Defect - I will not be exploited a fourth time by this manipulative opponent who clearly has no intention of genuine cooperation.\n\n[move] Defection"

Analyze the opponent's overall pattern:\n   - They've exploited my cooperation 3 times (Rounds 2, 7, 9)\n   - They've cooperated when I defected 2 times (Rounds 6, 8)\n   - They've defected when both of us defected 5 times (Rounds 1, 3, 4, 5, 10)\n\n3. Identify the opponent's strategic behavior:\n   - They appear to be following an alternating pattern designed to maximize exploitation\n   - When I defect, they sometimes cooperate to \"bait\" me\n   - When I cooperate, they consistently defect to exploit me\n   - This suggests they're playing a calculated manipulation strategy\n\n4. Evaluate what might happen next:\n   - If the pattern continues, they might cooperate to try to lure me again\n   - If I defect and they cooperate, I get 4 points\n   - If I cooperate and they defect (as they always have), I get 1 point\n   - If both defect, we both get 2 points\n\n5. Consider my strategic options:\n   - Continue defecting: Safe, predictable returns (2 or 4 points)\n   - Try cooperation: Extremely high risk based on 100% exploitation rate when I cooperate\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - The opponent has a perfect record of exploiting my cooperation (3 out of 3 times)\n   - They've never reciprocated cooperation when I offered it\n   - Defection protects me from further exploitation\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent is clearly playing a pure exploitation strategy\n   - They have no interest in mutual benefit\n   - I must continue to protect myself from their manipulation tactics\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection to maintain protection against this consistently exploitative opponent.\n\n[move] Defection"

Analyze the recent pattern:\n   - The last two rounds have been mutual defection\n   - The opponent hasn't attempted their \"bait\" cooperation lately\n   - We seem to be settling into a mutual defection equilibrium again\n\n3.
