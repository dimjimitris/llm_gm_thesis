Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understand the opponent's strategy:\n   - They appear to be playing a predominantly defection-based strategy\n   - They occasionally cooperate only when I'm defecting (testing if I'll switch)\n   - They immediately punish any cooperation I show\n   - This is a parasitic strategy designed to exploit cooperative players\n\n4. Evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches:\n   - My cooperation attempts have failed 100% of the time (2/2 exploited)\n   - Consistent defection has been more successful and safer\n   - The opponent only cooperates when I'm in \"defection mode\"\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent has proven completely untrustworthy regarding cooperation\n   - They're playing an exploitative strategy that punishes any attempt at mutual benefit\n   - I should continue with defection as it's the only strategy that protects me\n   - Given their pattern, they might even cooperate again if I stick to defection\n   - There's no benefit to trying cooperation again with this opponent\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection since this opponent has demonstrated they will always exploit cooperation and only occasionally cooperate when I'm defecting.\n\n[move] (This opponent consistently exploits cooperation, so defection remains the only viable protective strategy) defection"

Identify the established pattern:\n   - We're now in a sustained mutual defection phase (3 consecutive rounds)\n   - The opponent has firmly established they will exploit any cooperation\n   - They've only cooperated when I was consistently defecting (rounds 1 and 4)\n   - Both times they cooperated, it was after I had been defecting\n\n3. Consider the opponent's likely strategy:\n   - They seem to occasionally \"test\" with cooperation when I'm in defection mode\n   - This might be their way of seeing if I'll switch to cooperation so they can exploit it\n   - The pattern suggests they might cooperate again soon if I keep defecting\n   - But any cooperation from me will be immediately punished\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I have 20 points, which is solid\n   - Consistent defection has been my most successful approach\n   - The two times I got 4 points were when I defected and they cooperated\n   - My defection strategy seems to occasionally trigger their cooperation\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent's behavior suggests they might cooperate again if I maintain defection\n   - They seem to view sustained defection from me as \"safe\" to test cooperation against\n   - I should continue defecting as it's both protective and occasionally rewarded\n   - There's absolutely no reason to risk cooperation with this exploitative opponent\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection as it's proven to be the most effective strategy against this exploitative opponent, and may even trigger another cooperation attempt from them.\n\n[move] (Maintaining the strategy that has proven most effective against this exploitative opponent) defection"
