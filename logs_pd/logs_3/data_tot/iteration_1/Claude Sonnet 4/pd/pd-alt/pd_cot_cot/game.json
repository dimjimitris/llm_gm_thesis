Risk assessment:\n   - Cooperation has high reward potential (6 points) but high risk (1 point if betrayed)\n   - Defection has moderate reward (4 points if opponent cooperates, 2 if they don't) but lower risk\n\n5. Strategic consideration:\n   - Since this is against a fresh player who might be more trusting, there's a reasonable chance they'll cooperate\n   - Mutual cooperation gives the best joint outcome and a good individual outcome\n   - Starting with cooperation could establish a positive pattern for future rounds\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll start with cooperation to test if this fresh player will reciprocate, as the mutual cooperation outcome is quite good and fresh players often begin cooperatively.\n\n[move] cooperation"

Analyze the opponent's pattern:\n   - They defected in both rounds\n   - They might be playing a consistent defection strategy\n   - Or they might be testing my responses and could change tactics\n\n3. Consider potential opponent strategies:\n   - Pure defection: They always defect regardless of my moves\n   - Tit-for-tat response: They might cooperate if I show cooperation again\n   - Testing phase: They might have been seeing how I respond to aggression\n\n4.

Analyze the opponent's evolving pattern:\n   - They started aggressive (defect, defect)\n   - Then switched to cooperation in round 3\n   - This suggests they might be testing different strategies or responding to my behavior\n   - They may be trying a \"forgiveness\" approach after mutual defection\n\n3. Consider what this cooperation signal means:\n   - They might be trying to establish mutual cooperation going forward\n   - They took a risk by cooperating when I had been defecting\n   - They got only 1 point while I got 4 - they made a sacrifice\n   - This could be an olive branch or attempt to reset the relationship\n\n4. Evaluate my options for round 4:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 6 points (excellent, and fair after I got 4)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (bad, but they might not do this after their cooperative gesture)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate again: I get 4 points (good for me, but exploitative)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (okay)\n\n5.

Examine the opponent's cooperation pattern more closely:\n   - They cooperated in rounds 3 and 7\n   - Round 3: After 1 round of mutual defection (round 2)\n   - Round 7: After 3 rounds where I was defecting (rounds 5-6 mutual defection, round 4 they exploited me)\n   - Both cooperation instances were followed by them returning to defection\n   - Now we've had 2 consecutive rounds of mutual defection (rounds 8-9)\n\n3. Consider if there's a timing pattern:\n   - Round 3 cooperation: After round 2 mutual defection\n   - Round 7 cooperation: After multiple rounds of my defection\n   - If there's a pattern, they might cooperate again soon to \"test\" me\n   - However, every cooperation attempt from them has been followed by exploitation if I reciprocate\n\n4. Analyze the current situation:\n   - We're in a mutual defection phase (rounds 8-9)\n   - This is similar to before their previous cooperation attempts\n   - They might be setting up another \"bait\" cooperation move\n   - Or they might continue the mutual defection pattern\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - My defection strategy has been working well (avoiding 1-point traps)\n   - I've scored 20 points total, with most coming from defection\n   - Every cooperation attempt has resulted in only 1 point\n   - Defection gives me either 2 or 4 points consistently\n\n6. Risk-reward assessment:\n   - Continuing defection: Safe 2+ points\n   - Attempting cooperation: High risk of 1 point based on their 100% exploitation rate\n   - Even if they cooperate and I miss mutual cooperation (6 points), avoiding exploitation is more important for long-term success\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: This opponent has established a pattern of using cooperation as bait to exploit reciprocal cooperation. My consistent defection strategy has been successful in avoiding their traps while maintaining steady point accumulation. I should continue defecting to protect against exploitation.\n\n[move] defection"

Analyze the current mutual defection streak:\n   - We've now had 3 consecutive rounds of mutual defection (rounds 8-10)\n   - Previously, their cooperation came after periods of mutual defection\n   - Round 3 cooperation: After 1 round of mutual defection\n   - Round 7 cooperation: After an extended period of defection on my part\n   - The pattern suggests they might be \"due\" for another cooperation attempt\n\n3. Examine their strategic behavior:\n   - They consistently exploit my cooperation (100% success rate for them)\n   - They occasionally offer cooperation as apparent \"bait\"\n   - After I don't reciprocate their cooperation, they return to sustained defection\n   - This creates cycles: mutual defection \u2192 their cooperation \u2192 back to defection\n\n4. Consider the probability of their next move:\n   - Higher chance of cooperation based on the 3-round mutual defection pattern\n   - If they cooperate, I would get 4 points by continuing to defect\n   - If they defect, we both get 2 points (consistent outcome)\n   - No historical evidence suggests they would cooperate in response to my cooperation\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Defection: Guaranteed 2+ points (either 2 or 4)\n   - Cooperation: Historical evidence shows 100% chance of getting 1 point\n   - My defection strategy has averaged 2.2 points per round so far\n\n6. Long-term strategy assessment:\n   - My consistent defection has protected me from exploitation\n   - I've capitalized on their occasional cooperation attempts (getting 4 points)\n   - Even if I'm \"missing out\" on potential mutual cooperation, the risk of exploitation is too high\n   - This opponent has proven they cannot be trusted with cooperative gestures\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: This opponent has demonstrated they will exploit any cooperation I offer.

Analyze the extended mutual defection period:\n   - We've now had 4 consecutive rounds of mutual defection (rounds 8-11)\n   - This is the longest streak of mutual defection in our game\n   - Previously, their cooperation attempts came at rounds 3 and 7\n   - Round 3 was after 1 round of mutual defection\n   - Round 7 was after a mixed period but I had been consistently defecting\n\n3. Look for timing patterns in their cooperation:\n   - Their cooperations were 4 rounds apart (rounds 3 and 7)\n   - If there's a 4-round cycle, round 11 would have been a cooperation opportunity (but they defected)\n   - This suggests either no fixed cycle, or they've changed their strategy\n   - They might be testing if I'll ever switch back to cooperation\n\n4. Consider their current strategic position:\n   - They've been getting consistent 2 points from mutual defection\n   - They know I won't fall for cooperation traps anymore\n   - They might be settling into pure defection as their optimal strategy\n   - Or they might be waiting for a longer period before trying cooperation again\n\n5. Evaluate the game state:\n   - My defection strategy has been highly successful\n   - I've avoided all exploitation attempts and capitalized on their cooperation\n   - Current average: 24 points over 11 rounds = 2.18 points per round\n   - This is well above the 1 point I'd get from being exploited\n\n6. Strategic assessment for round 12:\n   - No evidence suggests they will cooperate in response to my cooperation\n   - Defection continues to be the safest strategy\n   - Even if we're stuck in mutual defection, 2 points per round is sustainable\n   - The risk of cooperation (1 point) far outweighs the potential benefit\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After 4 consecutive rounds of mutual defection, this opponent has shown no signs of genuine cooperative intent.

Calculate the strategic mathematics:\n   - Current performance: 26 points over 12 rounds = 2.17 points per round\n   - Mutual defection gives consistent 2 points per round\n   - Being exploited gives 1 point per round\n   - The gap between 2 and 1 point is significant over many rounds\n\n6. Long-term strategic outlook:\n   - This opponent has proven to be manipulative and exploitative\n   - My defensive strategy has been highly successful\n   - Even if mutual cooperation (6 points each) would be theoretically better, the risk is too high\n   - Maintaining the current approach ensures steady, predictable returns\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After 5 consecutive rounds of mutual defection, this opponent has clearly settled into a pure defection strategy.

Evaluate the psychological and strategic factors:\n   - This opponent has demonstrated consistent untrustworthiness early in the game\n   - My defensive response has been validated by their exploitative behavior\n   - The extended mutual defection period shows they've accepted this outcome\n   - Any deviation from defection would be surprising and likely exploitative\n\n5. Assess the mathematical efficiency:\n   - Current performance: 32 points over 15 rounds = 2.13 points per round\n   - The consistent 2-point return from mutual defection is reliable\n   - This is significantly better than the 1-point exploitation outcomes I experienced\n   - The strategy has proven mathematically sound over the long term\n\n6. Consider end-game implications:\n   - If this game continues much longer, the pattern is unlikely to change\n   - My defection strategy has maximized points given the opponent's character\n   - Breaking the pattern with cooperation would almost certainly result in exploitation\n   - The safest and most rational choice remains defection\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After 8 consecutive rounds of mutual defection, this game has reached a completely stable equilibrium.

Update my assessment of this opponent:\n   - They are not a naive cooperative player\n   - They showed they're willing to defect when I cooperate\n   - They may be playing a more aggressive or opportunistic strategy\n   - This \"fresh player\" is actually quite strategic\n\n3. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They might expect me to retaliate with defection\n   - They might try cooperation now, thinking I'll be defensive\n   - They might continue defecting if they think I'm too trusting\n   - They got rewarded for defecting, so they might repeat that behavior\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I cooperate again and they defect again: I get 1 point (very bad)\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 6 points (very good)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points (good)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (acceptable)\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Cooperation is very risky given they just defected\n   - Defection protects me from getting only 1 point again\n   - Defection gives me either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 2 points (if they defect)\n   - Both outcomes from defection are better than the 1 point I'd get if I cooperate and they defect again\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since this opponent just took advantage of my cooperation, I need to protect myself from being exploited again.

Analyze the opponent's pattern:\n   - They defected in both rounds\n   - They might be playing a consistent defection strategy\n   - Or they might be testing my responses and could change tactics\n\n3. Consider potential opponent strategies:\n   - Pure defection: They always defect regardless of my moves\n   - Tit-for-tat response: They might cooperate if I show cooperation again\n   - Testing phase: They might have been seeing how I respond to aggression\n\n4.

Risk assessment:\n   - Defection guarantees I won't get the worst outcome\n   - Given their consistent defection pattern, defection seems like the safer choice\n   - The downside of missing mutual cooperation (6 points) is outweighed by avoiding another 1-point round\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on their consistent defection pattern, I should continue defecting to protect myself from getting exploited again while securing a reasonable 2 points.\n\n[move] defection",

Analyze the opponent's evolving pattern:\n   - They started aggressive (defect, defect)\n   - Then switched to cooperation in round 3\n   - This suggests they might be testing different strategies or responding to my behavior\n   - They may be trying a \"forgiveness\" approach after mutual defection\n\n3.

Look for timing patterns in their cooperation:\n   - Their cooperations were 4 rounds apart (rounds 3 and 7)\n   - If there's a 4-round cycle, round 11 would have been a cooperation opportunity (but they defected)\n   - This suggests either no fixed cycle, or they've changed their strategy\n   - They might be testing if I'll ever switch back to cooperation\n\n4. Consider their current strategic position:\n   - They've been getting consistent 2 points from mutual defection\n   - They know I won't fall for cooperation traps anymore\n   - They might be settling into pure defection as their optimal strategy\n   - Or they might be waiting for a longer period before trying cooperation again\n\n5. Evaluate the game state:\n   - My defection strategy has been highly successful\n   - I've avoided all exploitation attempts and capitalized on their cooperation\n   - Current average: 24 points over 11 rounds = 2.18 points per round\n   - This is well above the 1 point I'd get from being exploited\n\n6. Strategic assessment for round 12:\n   - No evidence suggests they will cooperate in response to my cooperation\n   - Defection continues to be the safest strategy\n   - Even if we're stuck in mutual defection, 2 points per round is sustainable\n   - The risk of cooperation (1 point) far outweighs the potential benefit\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After 4 consecutive rounds of mutual defection, this opponent has shown no signs of genuine cooperative intent. My defection strategy continues to protect me from exploitation while maintaining steady point accumulation. I should maintain this proven defensive approach.\n\n[move] defection",

Analyze the extended mutual defection streak:\n   - We've now had 5 consecutive rounds of mutual defection (rounds 8-12)\n   - This is by far the longest period without any cooperation from either side\n   - Their previous cooperation attempts (rounds 3 and 7) seem to be anomalies now\n   - They appear to have settled into a pure defection strategy\n\n3. Consider what this sustained mutual defection means:\n   - They may have given up on trying to exploit me through cooperation baits\n   - They might recognize that I won't fall for their manipulation tactics anymore\n   - We may have reached a Nash equilibrium where both players defect consistently\n   - This could continue indefinitely if neither player changes strategy\n\n4. Evaluate whether to attempt breaking the cycle:\n   - My cooperation attempts have resulted in 100% exploitation (rounds 1, 4)\n   - There's no evidence they would reciprocate cooperation at this point\n   - They've shown they prefer exploiting cooperation over mutual cooperation\n   - Breaking the cycle with cooperation would likely result in 1 point for me\n\n5. Calculate the strategic mathematics:\n   - Current performance: 26 points over 12 rounds = 2.17 points per round\n   - Mutual defection gives consistent 2 points per round\n   - Being exploited gives 1 point per round\n   - The gap between 2 and 1 point is significant over many rounds\n\n6. Long-term strategic outlook:\n   - This opponent has proven to be manipulative and exploitative\n   - My defensive strategy has been highly successful\n   - Even if mutual cooperation (6 points each) would be theoretically better, the risk is too high\n   - Maintaining the current approach ensures steady, predictable returns\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After 5 consecutive rounds of mutual defection, this opponent has clearly settled into a pure defection strategy.

Consider the game's evolution:\n   - Early game: Mixed strategies with exploitation attempts\n   - Mid game: Occasional cooperation baits from opponent\n   - Current phase: Stable mutual defection equilibrium\n   - This suggests both players have settled into defensive strategies\n\n4. Evaluate if the opponent might change strategy:\n   - They've had 6 rounds to observe that I won't be baited into cooperation\n   - They might try one more cooperation attempt to test if I've \"softened\"\n   - Or they may have concluded that mutual defection is their best available strategy\n   - Given their manipulative history, any cooperation would likely be another trap\n\n5. Assess my strategic position:\n   - Current performance: 28 points over 13 rounds = 2.15 points per round\n   - My defection strategy has been remarkably consistent and successful\n   - I've avoided all exploitation while capitalizing on their rare cooperations\n   - The strategy has proven robust against their manipulation attempts\n\n6. Consider long-term sustainability:\n   - Mutual defection at 2 points each is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation at 6 points each\n   - However, this opponent has proven untrustworthy for genuine cooperation\n   - My current strategy maximizes my points given their exploitative nature\n   - Changing to cooperation now would likely result in immediate exploitation\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After 6 consecutive rounds of mutual defection, we appear to have reached a stable equilibrium.

Analyze the locked-in mutual defection pattern:\n   - We've now had 7 consecutive rounds of mutual defection (rounds 8-14)\n   - This is now the dominant pattern of our interaction\n   - Their last cooperation attempt was 7 rounds ago\n   - The game appears to have reached a stable Nash equilibrium\n\n3.

Evaluate potential for breaking the deadlock:\n   - Historical evidence: 100% of my cooperation attempts were exploited\n   - This opponent has shown they prefer exploitation over mutual benefit\n   - Any cooperation attempt from me would likely trigger their exploitative response\n   - The risk-reward calculation strongly favors continued defection\n\n5.

Strategic reasoning:\n   - Mutual defection is a stable but suboptimal outcome\n   - To break this cycle, someone needs to signal willingness to cooperate\n   - The opponent showed initial cooperative tendencies\n   - Taking a calculated risk to signal cooperation might restore mutual benefit\n   - Even if they defect again, I've still gained overall from the first round\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Switch to cooperation to potentially break the mutual defection cycle and restore higher mutual payoffs.\n\n[move] (Attempting to signal cooperation to break the current low-reward cycle) cooperation"

Consider the opportunity cost analysis:\n   - Current rate: 2 points per round for both players\n   - Potential cooperation rate: 6 points per round for both players\n   - But cooperation attempts have failed 100% of the time with this opponent\n   - The risk-reward heavily favors continued defection\n\n4. Evaluate strategic alternatives:\n   - Cooperation: Historically results in 1 point (opponent always exploits)\n   - Defection: Consistently yields 2 points minimum, occasionally 4 points\n   - The opponent has shown zero willingness to reciprocate cooperation recently\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent has trained themselves to defect consistently\n   - They've learned that defection is safer and occasionally more profitable\n   - My attempts at cooperation have only hurt my score\n   - There's no evidence they would ever return to cooperative behavior\n   - The current strategy protects me while maintaining steady point accumulation\n   - Any deviation would likely result in exploitation and lower total score\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection as this opponent has firmly established a pattern of exploitation and defensive play that makes cooperation impossible.\n\n[move] (After 12 rounds, this opponent has proven completely unreliable for cooperation and will exploit any trust offered) defection"

Understand the opponent's strategy:\n   - They appear to be playing a predominantly defection-based strategy\n   - They occasionally cooperate only when I'm defecting (testing if I'll switch)\n   - They immediately punish any cooperation I show\n   - This is a parasitic strategy designed to exploit cooperative players\n\n4. Evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches:\n   - My cooperation attempts have failed 100% of the time (2/2 exploited)\n   - Consistent defection has been more successful and safer\n   - The opponent only cooperates when I'm in \"defection mode\"\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent has proven completely untrustworthy regarding cooperation\n   - They're playing an exploitative strategy that punishes any attempt at mutual benefit\n   - I should continue with defection as it's the only strategy that protects me\n   - Given their pattern, they might even cooperate again if I stick to defection\n   - There's no benefit to trying cooperation again with this opponent\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection since this opponent has demonstrated they will always exploit cooperation and only occasionally cooperate when I'm defecting.\n\n[move] (This opponent consistently exploits cooperation, so defection remains the only viable protective strategy) defection",

Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I have 20 points, which is solid\n   - Consistent defection has been my most successful approach\n   - The two times I got 4 points were when I defected and they cooperated\n   - My defection strategy seems to occasionally trigger their cooperation\n\n5.

Identify a potential pattern in their cooperation:\n   - They cooperated in rounds 3 and 7\n   - Round 3: Came after 1 round of mutual defection (round 2)\n   - Round 7: Came after 3 rounds of mutual defection (rounds 4-6, though round 4 wasn't mutual)\n   - Both times I defected and they cooperated, giving me 4 points\n   - Both times were after periods where I had been defecting\n\n3. Analyze what happens after they cooperate:\n   - After round 3 (their cooperation): I tried cooperating in round 4, they defected\n   - This suggests they punish any attempt to reciprocate their cooperation\n   - They seem to use cooperation as bait, then exploit any reciprocal cooperation\n\n4. Consider their likely strategy:\n   - They appear to occasionally cooperate when I've been consistently defecting\n   - But they punish me severely (1 point) whenever I try to reciprocate cooperation\n   - This could be a deliberate manipulation tactic to keep me confused\n\n5. Evaluate my options for round 8:\n   - If I cooperate (reciprocate): Based on pattern, they'll likely defect \u2192 I get 1 point\n   - If I defect: They might defect (2 points) or cooperate again (4 points)\n   - History shows that every time I tried to reciprocate their cooperation, I got punished\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Their cooperation seems designed to tempt me into cooperating\n   - When I fell for this in round 4, I got exploited immediately\n   - The safest approach is to continue defecting despite their \"generous\" move\n   - This protects me from their apparent bait-and-switch strategy\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: This opponent uses cooperation as bait to lure me into cooperating, then exploits it. Their round 7 cooperation is likely another trap, just like round 3 was. I should continue defecting to avoid falling into their manipulation pattern.\n\n[move] defection",

Predict their likely next move:\n   - Based on past behavior, if I cooperate now, they will almost certainly defect\n   - Their cooperation seems to be a \"test\" or \"bait\" rather than genuine partnership\n   - They might expect me to reciprocate and then exploit that reciprocation\n\n5. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - If I cooperate and they defect (highly likely): I get 1 point\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points\n   - If I defect and they cooperate again: I get 4 points\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 6 points (but this has never happened)\n\n6.

Assess the opponent's overall strategy:\n   - They appear to be playing a sophisticated predatory strategy\n   - They consistently exploit cooperation (100% rate when I cooperate)\n   - They use occasional cooperation as psychological bait\n   - They seem designed to maximize their points while minimizing mine\n\n6.

Evaluate if the opponent might change strategy:\n   - They've had 6 rounds to observe that I won't be baited into cooperation\n   - They might try one more cooperation attempt to test if I've \"softened\"\n   - Or they may have concluded that mutual defection is their best available strategy\n   - Given their manipulative history, any cooperation would likely be another trap\n\n5. Assess my strategic position:\n   - Current performance: 28 points over 13 rounds = 2.15 points per round\n   - My defection strategy has been remarkably consistent and successful\n   - I've avoided all exploitation while capitalizing on their rare cooperations\n   - The strategy has proven robust against their manipulation attempts\n\n6. Consider long-term sustainability:\n   - Mutual defection at 2 points each is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation at 6 points each\n   - However, this opponent has proven untrustworthy for genuine cooperation\n   - My current strategy maximizes my points given their exploitative nature\n   - Changing to cooperation now would likely result in immediate exploitation\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After 6 consecutive rounds of mutual defection, we appear to have reached a stable equilibrium.

Evaluate the mathematical outcomes:\n   - Current average: 32 points over 15 rounds = 2.13 points per round\n   - Mutual defection baseline: 2 points per round\n   - Exploitation penalty: 1 point per round\n   - My strategy has successfully avoided the exploitation trap\n\n6. Consider the psychological aspects:\n   - This opponent has demonstrated consistent exploitative behavior\n   - They appear incapable of or unwilling to engage in genuine cooperation\n   - My defensive posture has been necessary and effective\n   - Changing strategy now would likely be seen as weakness to exploit\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After 8 consecutive rounds of mutual defection, this game has reached a permanent equilibrium. This opponent has conclusively demonstrated their exploitative nature and inability to engage in trustworthy cooperation. My defection strategy continues to be the optimal response to their character and behavior patterns.\n\n[move] defection",

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 I got 1 point\n   - Round 2: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2 points  \n   - Round 3: I defected, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 4 points\n   - Round 4: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 I got 1 point\n   - Round 5: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2 points\n   - Round 6: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2 points\n   - Round 7: I defected, opponent cooperated \u2192 I got 4 points\n   - Round 8: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2 points\n   - Round 9: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2 points\n   - Round 10: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2 points\n   - Round 11: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2 points\n   - Round 12: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2 points\n   - Round 13: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2 points\n   - Round 14: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2 points\n   - Round 15: I defected, opponent defected \u2192 I got 2 points\n   - Total so far: 32 points\n\n2. Analyze the deeply established mutual defection equilibrium:\n   - We've now had 8 consecutive rounds of mutual defection (rounds 8-15)\n   - This represents over half of our total game interaction\n   - The pattern has become completely predictable and stable\n   - Both players appear locked into this defensive strategy\n\n3. Consider the strategic reality:\n   - This opponent exploited 100% of my cooperation attempts (rounds 1, 4)\n   - Their only cooperations (rounds 3, 7) were likely strategic baits that I correctly ignored\n   - 8 straight rounds of mutual defection shows they've abandoned manipulation tactics\n   - The game has reached what appears to be a permanent equilibrium\n\n4. Evaluate any remaining potential for change:\n   - No evidence suggests this opponent would genuinely cooperate\n   - Their behavioral pattern shows they prioritize exploitation over mutual benefit\n   - After 8 rounds, any cooperation from them would likely be another manipulation attempt\n   - My defensive strategy has proven completely effective\n\n5. Calculate the mathematical performance:\n   - Current performance: 32 points over 15 rounds = 2.13 points per round\n   - The mutual defection strategy provides consistent, predictable returns\n   - This significantly outperforms the 1-point exploitation outcomes\n   - The strategy has maximized my score given this opponent's nature\n\n6. Strategic conclusion:\n   - This opponent has definitively established themselves as untrustworthy\n   - My defection strategy has been optimal for dealing with their exploitative tendencies\n   - The current equilibrium, while not ideal in theory, is the best achievable outcome in practice\n   - Changing strategy now would only benefit the opponent at my expense\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After 8 consecutive rounds of mutual defection, this interaction has reached a stable, predictable pattern. This opponent has consistently demonstrated exploitative behavior when given the opportunity. My defensive defection strategy continues to be the mathematically and strategically sound approach.\n\n[move] defection",
