However, switching to cooperation is risky - if they stick with defection, I'd only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nGiven that we both showed defensive thinking in round one, and considering that repeated interaction might allow for the development of trust, I'm willing to take a calculated risk and try cooperation this round.
