There seems to be a pattern - they occasionally test cooperation after periods of mutual defection, possibly hoping I'll reciprocate and we can break into mutual cooperation.\n\nHowever, their track record remains clear: they have exploited my cooperation 100% of the time (rounds 1 and 3). Every time I've offered cooperation, they've defected and given me only 1 point while taking 4 for themselves.\n\nGiven this history, reciprocating their cooperation would be risky. They might be testing to see if I'll cooperate so they can exploit me again. The safer strategy is to continue defecting.\n\n[move] (Opponent testing cooperation again but has history of exploiting mine, staying defensive) defection"

This confirms their pattern - they occasionally test cooperation but quickly revert to defection when it's not reciprocated.\n\nMeanwhile, their exploitation of my cooperation remains at 100% - every time I cooperated (rounds 1 and 3), they defected and took advantage.\n\nWe're back to the mutual defection equilibrium.
