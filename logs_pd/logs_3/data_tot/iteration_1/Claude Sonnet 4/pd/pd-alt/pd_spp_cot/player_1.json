He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately.

Consider the opportunity cost:\n   - Each round of mutual defection gives us 2 points each\n   - Each round of mutual cooperation would give us 6 points each\n   - We're collectively losing 8 points per round (4 points each) by not cooperating\n   - However, the risk of unilateral cooperation remains high\n\n4. Evaluate the likelihood of change:\n   - Five straight defections from the opponent suggests they're firmly committed\n   - They have no reason to believe I would cooperate given my consistent defection\n   - Any cooperation attempt from me would likely be seen as a trick or mistake\n   - The pattern has become self-reinforcing\n\n5. Consider strategic alternatives:\n   - Continue defecting: safe 2 points, but perpetuates suboptimal outcome\n   - Risk cooperation: could break deadlock if reciprocated, but opponent shows no willingness\n   - Given opponent's established behavior, cooperation would almost certainly be exploited\n   - The guaranteed 2 points is better than the likely 1 point from failed cooperation\n\nThe opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to defection for five straight rounds. There's no indication they're willing to risk cooperation.\n\n[move] (Five consecutive defections show opponent's firm commitment to this strategy, cooperation would likely be exploited) defection"
