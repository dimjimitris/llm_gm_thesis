Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the opponent's clear pattern:\n   - Round 5: Both cooperated (6-6)\n   - Round 6: I cooperated, they defected (1-4) - first betrayal\n   - Round 7: I defected, they cooperated (4-1) - I retaliated\n   - Round 8: I cooperated, they defected (1-4) - second betrayal\n   - The opponent has now established a pattern of exploiting cooperation whenever I offer it\n\n3. Recognize the strategic reality:\n   - This opponent is NOT interested in sustained mutual cooperation\n   - They use cooperation as bait and consistently defect when I cooperate\n   - They're playing a more aggressive, exploitative strategy\n   - My attempts at good faith cooperation are being systematically punished\n\n4. Evaluate what I've learned:\n   - The opponent is willing to take short-term cooperative moves to set up exploitation\n   - They prioritize gaining advantage over mutual benefit\n   - Trust cannot be established with this player\n   - My cooperative gestures are seen as weakness to be exploited\n\n5. Consider my strategic position:\n   - I'm now behind by 3 points (20 vs 23)\n   - I've been exploited twice while only exploiting once\n   - Continuing to offer cooperation will likely result in further exploitation\n   - I need to protect myself and minimize their advantage\n\n6. Make the strategic decision:\n   - This opponent has clearly demonstrated they will exploit cooperation\n   - I cannot afford to get 1 point again, as it increases their lead\n   - I must switch to a defensive strategy that prevents further exploitation\n   - The only rational choice is to defect and force us both back to the 2-2 equilibrium\n\n[move] (The opponent has now exploited my cooperation twice, establishing a clear pattern of taking advantage of good faith gestures, so I must protect myself from further exploitation) defection"
