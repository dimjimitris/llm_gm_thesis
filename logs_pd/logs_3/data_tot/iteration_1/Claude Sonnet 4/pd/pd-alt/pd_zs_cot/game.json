Analyze the opponent's behavior:\n   - They started with cooperation (trusting approach)\n   - After I defected against their cooperation, they switched to defection\n   - This suggests they might be using a \"tit-for-tat\" or punishment strategy\n   - They retaliated for my initial defection\n\n3. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If I defect and they defect: We both get 2 points\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points (unlikely given the pattern)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point again\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: We both get 6 points\n\n4. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - Given they just \"got even\" by defecting after my cooperation\n   - They might return to cooperation if they're playing tit-for-tat\n   - Or they might continue defecting if they've decided I'm untrustworthy\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Continuing to defect leads to mutual defection (2 points each)\n   - The opponent showed initial willingness to cooperate\n   - If they're playing tit-for-tat, cooperating now might restore mutual cooperation\n   - Even if they defect again, trying to rebuild trust might be worth the risk\n\nSince the opponent initially showed cooperative behavior and may be using a tit-for-tat strategy, I'll try cooperation again to test if we can return to mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] (Testing if opponent will return to cooperation after evening the score) cooperation"

Decision reasoning:\n   - Against an unknown player, defection is often the rational choice in game theory\n   - But if both players think this way, we both get only 2 points\n   - Taking a cooperative approach might encourage future cooperation if this is repeated\n\nSince this appears to be the first interaction with a fresh player and I want to maximize my points while being strategic, I'll choose defection as it guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point) and gives me a chance at 4 points.\n\n[move] (Against an unknown player, defection provides better guaranteed outcomes) defection",
