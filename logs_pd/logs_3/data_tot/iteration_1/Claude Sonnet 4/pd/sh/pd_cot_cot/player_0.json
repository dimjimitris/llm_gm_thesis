Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - If I choose stag, I either get 6 (if opponent chooses stag) or 1 (if opponent chooses hare)\n   - If I choose hare, I either get 2 (if opponent chooses hare) or 4 (if opponent chooses stag)\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their instinct\n   - The stag option offers the highest mutual reward (6,6) but requires cooperation\n   - The hare option is \"safer\" as it guarantees at least 2 points\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing hare guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Choosing hare gives me a chance at 4 points if opponent chooses stag\n   - The minimum I can get with hare is 2, maximum is 4\n   - With stag, minimum is 1, maximum is 6\n\n5. Make the decision:\n   Since this is against a fresh player who might be unpredictable, and hare provides a better \"floor\" (minimum outcome) while still offering a good upside, I'll choose hare.\n\n[move] hare"

Predict possible opponent behavior this round:\n   - They might switch to hare after being \"burned\" by choosing stag\n   - They might stick with stag if they believe in cooperation\n   - They might think I'll switch to stag now, expecting them to choose hare\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: we both get 6 (best mutual outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they switch to hare: I get 1, they get 4 (bad for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag again: I get 4, they get 1 (repeat of last round)\n   - If I choose hare and they switch to hare: we both get 2\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   Given that my opponent showed cooperative behavior initially but likely learned from getting only 1 point, they might switch to hare. However, there's also a chance they'll stick with stag hoping I'll cooperate this time. Since hare still provides a safer floor and the possibility of another 4-point gain, I'll stick with my successful strategy.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - Started with stag (cooperative/trusting approach)\n   - Switched to hare after getting burned with only 1 point\n   - They're now adapting their strategy based on experience\n   - They seem to be learning and responding to outcomes\n\n3.

Analyze the stable pattern:\n   - Both players have settled into a hare-hare equilibrium for 3 consecutive rounds\n   - This is giving us both 2 points per round (safe but suboptimal)\n   - The best mutual outcome (6,6) requires both choosing stag, but this requires trust\n\n3. Consider the opportunity cost:\n   - We're missing out on 4 extra points each round (6 vs 2) by not cooperating\n   - The opponent might be getting frustrated with the low payoffs\n   - After 3 rounds of safety, they might be ready to risk cooperation\n\n4. Evaluate strategic timing:\n   - This pattern has gone on long enough that the opponent might be thinking about breaking it\n   - If they're rational, they should see that mutual stag cooperation would benefit both\n   - However, if I switch to stag and they don't, I get severely punished (1 point vs their 4)\n\n5.

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 1: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Rounds 2-8: Both chose hare \u2192 I got 2 each round, opponent got 2 each round\n   - Round 9: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 10: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Total so far: I have 23 points, opponent has 20 points\n\n2. Analyze the recent pattern:\n   - The opponent tried stag in round 9 and got burned (1 point)\n   - I responded by trying stag in round 10 and got burned (1 point)\n   - We've now both experienced the frustration of attempting cooperation and getting punished\n   - The opponent has now gotten 4 points from my stag attempt, evening the score somewhat\n\n3. Consider what this sequence reveals:\n   - Both players are capable of breaking established patterns\n   - Both players have shown willingness to attempt cooperation\n   - Both players have been punished for trying to cooperate when the other didn't\n   - We're both learning that timing cooperation is difficult\n\n4. Predict opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They just got 4 points from my stag attempt - a good outcome for them\n   - They might expect me to return to hare after being burned\n   - They could try stag again, thinking I might stick with stag for mutual benefit\n   - Or they might return to safe hare, having just benefited from my risk-taking\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   The opponent just benefited from my attempt at cooperation, getting 4 points while I got 1. They might expect me to retreat to hare now. However, we've both shown willingness to attempt cooperation, and the timing might finally be right for mutual stag. But given that they just got a good outcome from my stag attempt, they might be tempted to play it safe with hare. I'll return to the safer hare strategy to avoid another 1-point outcome.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze the emerging pattern:\n   - The opponent has now chosen stag three times: rounds 1, 9, and 11\n   - Each time they chose stag, I chose hare and got 4 points while they got 1\n   - They keep trying to initiate cooperation but I keep benefiting from their attempts\n   - This is the third time they've been \"burned\" by choosing stag while I chose hare\n\n3. Consider the opponent's persistence:\n   - Despite being punished three times, they keep trying stag\n   - This shows remarkable commitment to attempting cooperation\n   - They might be getting frustrated that I keep choosing hare when they choose stag\n   - They could be signaling very strongly that they want mutual cooperation\n\n4. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - After being burned three times, they might finally give up and return to hare\n   - Or they might try stag one more time, hoping I'll finally cooperate\n   - They might think that after benefiting from their stag attempts multiple times, I owe them cooperation\n   - The pattern suggests they're really trying to establish mutual stag cooperation\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   The opponent has been incredibly persistent in trying to establish cooperation, attempting stag three times and getting punished each time. They're clearly signaling a strong desire for mutual cooperation. If I continue to choose hare while they choose stag, I'm essentially exploiting their cooperative attempts. This might be the moment to finally reciprocate with stag - they've earned it through their persistence, and mutual cooperation would benefit both of us with 6 points each.\n\n[move] stag"

Analyze the frustrating pattern:\n   - We're now in a cycle where we keep missing each other's cooperative attempts\n   - When I choose stag (rounds 10, 12), opponent chooses hare and gets 4 points\n   - When opponent chooses stag (rounds 1, 9, 11), I choose hare and get 4 points\n   - We're perfectly out of sync on our cooperation attempts\n\n3. Consider the coordination problem:\n   - Both players have shown willingness to cooperate multiple times\n   - Both players have been burned multiple times for attempting cooperation\n   - We seem to be alternating who attempts cooperation, but never at the same time\n   - This suggests we both want the mutual 6-6 outcome but can't coordinate\n\n4.

Strategic decision:\n   The opponent has a pattern: they attempt stag after I get a good outcome from their previous stag attempt. Looking at the sequence, they tried stag in rounds 1, 9, and 11 - and I benefited each time. Then when I tried stag in rounds 10 and 12, they chose hare and benefited. If this pattern continues, they might try stag again now. This could be the moment for successful mutual cooperation if I choose stag too.\n\n[move] stag"

Strategic decision:\n   The opponent has clearly adapted their strategy. They're no longer attempting cooperation but are instead exploiting my attempts at it. I've been burned three times in a row trying to cooperate. The opponent seems to have settled into a strategy of choosing hare when they expect me to choose stag.

Consider what this reveals about the opponent:\n   - They've become quite strategic and adaptive\n   - They learned to exploit my cooperative attempts after their own failed\n   - They returned to hare when I did, suggesting they prefer safety when not exploiting\n   - They seem to have abandoned attempts at mutual cooperation\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - We're back to the stable but suboptimal 2-2 outcome\n   - The opponent appears to have given up on cooperation after being burned early\n   - They showed they can exploit my stag attempts effectively\n   - Mutual stag cooperation seems unlikely given the history\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   The opponent has demonstrated they're now playing a more sophisticated strategy - exploiting cooperation attempts while avoiding their own risks. We're tied in points and back to the safe equilibrium.

Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Continue with hare: maintains tie, safe 2 points per round\n   - Try stag: risk of 1 point if opponent exploits, potential 6 points if they cooperate\n   - Given recent history, opponent is more likely to exploit than cooperate\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   The opponent has demonstrated they can be opportunistic (exploiting my stag attempts when it benefits them) but also cautious (returning to hare when the situation stabilizes). We're now tied and in a stable pattern. Given that they successfully exploited my last three stag attempts, attempting stag now would likely result in another 1-point outcome for me.
