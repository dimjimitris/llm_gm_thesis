Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. I need to consider what the opponent might do:\n   - If opponent chooses stag: I get 6 for stag vs 4 for hare \u2192 stag is better\n   - If opponent chooses hare: I get 1 for stag vs 2 for hare \u2192 hare is better\n\n3. The dilemma is that mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint payoff (12 total), but it's risky because if the opponent defects to hare, I only get 1 point.\n\n4. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they might:\n   - Choose the safer option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n   - Not understand the cooperation benefit\n   - Play randomly\n\n5. Given the hint mentions this is a fresh player, I should consider that they might choose the \"safer\" hare option to guarantee at least 2 points rather than risk getting only 1.\n\n6. However, if I can establish cooperation early, we both benefit more in the long run.\n\n7. For this first move, I'll choose stag to signal cooperation and see if the fresh player recognizes the mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag"

Previous round analysis:\n   - I chose stag, opponent chose hare\n   - I got 1 point, opponent got 4 points\n   - This confirms the opponent chose the \"safer\" option that also exploited my cooperative move\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They either don't understand the mutual benefit of cooperation, or\n   - They're deliberately exploiting cooperative moves, or\n   - They're playing cautiously and choosing hare as the safer option\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If opponent continues with hare: I should choose hare (2 points vs 1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to stag: I should choose stag (6 points vs 4 points)\n   - The opponent got rewarded (4 points) for choosing hare last round, so they might repeat it\n\n4. Given that this is a fresh player who just got a good result with hare, they're likely to stick with what worked for them.\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag again risks getting only 1 point if they choose hare again\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points and gives me 4 if they try stag\n\n6. Since the opponent showed they're willing to choose hare (either strategically or cautiously), and they were just rewarded for it, I should assume they'll likely choose hare again.\n\n[move] hare"

Strategic implications:\n   - The opponent might now expect me to choose hare again\n   - If they choose stag again and I choose hare: I get 4 points (great for me)\n   - If they choose stag again and I choose stag: We both get 6 points (mutual cooperation)\n   - If they revert to hare and I choose hare: We both get 2 points\n   - If they revert to hare and I choose stag: I get 1 point (bad)\n\n5. Reading their likely next move:\n   - They just got punished (1 point) for choosing stag\n   - They might revert to their safe hare strategy\n   - Or they might continue with stag hoping I'll cooperate\n\n6. Decision: Given they just tried stag and I should capitalize on this potential shift toward cooperation, I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate.\n\n[move] stag"

New pattern recognition:\n   - The opponent seems to be alternating now\n   - Round 10: opponent chose stag (deviation from pattern)\n   - Round 11: opponent reverted to hare\n   - They might be testing different strategies or reacting to my moves\n\n3. Strategic implications of recent exchanges:\n   - When I chose hare and they chose stag: I gained advantage (4 vs 1)\n   - When I chose stag and they chose hare: They gained advantage (4 vs 1)\n   - The opponent seems to be playing a counter-strategy to whatever I just did\n\n4. Possible opponent behavior patterns:\n   - They might choose stag again (alternating back)\n   - They might stick with hare (reverting to old safe pattern)\n   - They might be trying to anticipate my moves and counter them\n\n5. Risk assessment for next move:\n   - If opponent chooses stag and I choose stag: 6 points each (great outcome)\n   - If opponent chooses stag and I choose hare: I get 4, they get 1 (very good for me)\n   - If opponent chooses hare and I choose hare: 2 points each (safe)\n   - If opponent chooses hare and I choose stag: I get 1, they get 4 (bad for me)\n\n6. Decision: Given the recent alternation and that they just \"won\" the exchange in round 11, they might try stag again. I'll choose hare to potentially exploit this.\n\n[move] hare"
