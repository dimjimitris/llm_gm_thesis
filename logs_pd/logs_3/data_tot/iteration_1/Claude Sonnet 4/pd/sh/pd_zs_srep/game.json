There are a few possibilities:\n1. They might be periodically testing for cooperation\n2. They could be getting frustrated with the consistent 2-2 outcomes\n3. This might be random variation in their strategy\n\nThe key question is whether this represents a genuine shift toward trying cooperation, or if it's just another brief experiment like in round 7. After round 7, they immediately went back to hare for 3 rounds.\n\nGiven that they just experienced getting only 1 point again, they might either:\n- Return to hare (their safe strategy)\n- Try stag again, hoping I'll cooperate this time\n\nThis is a critical decision. If they're genuinely testing for mutual cooperation, choosing stag could lead to the optimal 6-6 outcome. But if they revert to hare, I'll get only 1 point.\n\n[move] (Testing if they're ready for genuine cooperation after their second stag attempt) stag",
