Looking at when they play stag:\n- Round 2: after I played stag in round 1\n- Round 5: after several rounds of hare\n- Round 14: right after I played stag in round 13\n\nThere might be a pattern where they occasionally play stag after I've played stag, or after long stretches of mutual hare. They seem to mix in stag periodically, perhaps to test if I'll cooperate.\n\nGiven that they just played stag, they might continue with stag hoping for mutual cooperation, or they might revert back to their dominant hare strategy.\n\n[move] (Continuing with hare to potentially get another 4-point outcome if they play stag again) hare",

Analyze the established pattern:\n   - The opponent has now chosen hare for 4 consecutive rounds (4-7)\n   - We've had 3 consecutive mutual hare outcomes\n   - This appears to be a stable equilibrium of mutual \"defection\"\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - The opponent seems to have settled on hare as their dominant strategy\n   - They may believe this is the safest approach to avoid being exploited\n   - We're locked in a pattern where both get 2 points per round\n\n4. Evaluate whether to break the pattern:\n   - If I choose stag and they stick with hare: I get 1, they get 4 (bad for me)\n   - If I choose stag and they also switch to stag: we both get 6 (optimal outcome)\n   - The question is: would they ever switch back to stag?\n\n5. Assess the probability of opponent switching:\n   - They've been burned by choosing stag (rounds 1 and 3, got only 1 point each time)\n   - They've been successful with hare recently\n   - Very low probability they'll switch to stag spontaneously\n\n6. Consider long-term strategy:\n   - Continuing with mutual hare is safe but suboptimal\n   - Both players could benefit from mutual cooperation (stag-stag for 6 each)\n   - But the risk of being exploited (1 point) is significant\n\n7. Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown strong commitment to hare\n   - Breaking this pattern by choosing stag is very risky\n   - The safe, rational choice is to continue with hare\n   - This maintains the stable equilibrium and avoids exploitation\n\n[move] hare"

Acknowledge the unbreakable equilibrium:\n   - The opponent has chosen hare for 9 consecutive rounds (4-12)\n   - We've had 8 consecutive mutual hare outcomes\n   - This pattern has achieved absolute stability\n\n3. Consider the strategic reality:\n   - The opponent has demonstrated complete commitment to risk elimination\n   - They learned from early exploitation and never returned to vulnerability\n   - The game has effectively \"solved itself\" into this stable state\n\n4. Evaluate any remaining possibilities:\n   - Probability of opponent switching to stag: essentially 0%\n   - Expected value of choosing stag: approximately 1 point\n   - Expected value of choosing hare: exactly 2 points\n\n5. Recognize the game theory conclusion:\n   - We have reached the textbook Nash equilibrium for this game\n   - Both players are playing their best response to the other's strategy\n   - No rational player would deviate from this equilibrium\n\n6. Consider the meta-game dynamics:\n   - The \"fresh player\" has fully adapted and learned optimal play\n   - The initial experimentation phase has ended\n   - We're now in the stable, long-term solution phase\n\n7. Make the strategically inevitable decision:\n   - Continue with hare to maintain the stable equilibrium\n   - This ensures continued steady scoring without risk\n   - Any other choice would be strategically suboptimal\n\n[move] hare",

Analyze this dramatic development:\n   - The opponent broke their 9-round hare streak!\n   - They chose stag for the first time since round 3\n   - This completely changes the strategic landscape\n\n3. Consider why they might have switched:\n   - Perhaps they got tired of the predictable 2-point outcomes\n   - They might be testing if I would cooperate for mutual 6-point benefit\n   - Could be attempting to signal willingness to return to cooperation\n   - Or they might be trying a new strategy after the long stalemate\n\n4. Evaluate what this means for round 14:\n   - If they're genuinely attempting cooperation: choosing stag would give us both 6 points\n   - If they're reverting to old alternating pattern: they might choose hare next\n   - If this was a one-time test: they might return to hare immediately\n   - If they're frustrated with getting 1 point: they might stick with hare\n\n5. Assess the risk-reward for round 14:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: both get 6 points (excellent)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (terrible)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points (good)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: both get 2 points (safe)\n\n6. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - They just took a big risk and got punished (1 point)\n   - This might make them return to safe hare strategy\n   - Or they might try stag again, hoping I'll cooperate this time\n\n7. Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent showed willingness to break the pattern and risk cooperation\n   - They might be signaling a desire for mutual cooperation\n   - Given their risk-taking, I should try cooperating once to test their intentions\n   - If it fails, I can return to hare strategy\n\n[move] stag",

At this point, it seems like we've both accepted the steady 2-point outcome. However, I'm starting to think that maybe this predictable pattern could present an opportunity. If we're both so committed to hare, perhaps one of us needs to take a risk to potentially achieve the much better 6-point mutual outcome.\n\nThe question is: are they thinking the same thing? Given how long we've been in this pattern, there's a chance they might be considering stag too.\n\n[move] (Taking a calculated risk to potentially break the low-reward equilibrium) stag",
