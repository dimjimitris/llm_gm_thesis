Their pattern:\n- Hare: rounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (10 times)\n- Stag: rounds 2, 5 (2 times)\n\nWe're deeply entrenched in this mutual hare equilibrium. At this point, it seems like we've both accepted the steady 2-point outcome. However, I'm starting to think that maybe this predictable pattern could present an opportunity. If we're both so committed to hare, perhaps one of us needs to take a risk to potentially achieve the much better 6-point mutual outcome.\n\nThe question is: are they thinking the same thing? Given how long we've been in this pattern, there's a chance they might be considering stag too.\n\n[move] (Taking a calculated risk to potentially break the low-reward equilibrium) stag"

The opponent just played stag in round 14, which is their third time overall (rounds 2, 5, and 14). Looking at when they play stag:\n- Round 2: after I played stag in round 1\n- Round 5: after several rounds of hare\n- Round 14: right after I played stag in round 13\n\nThere might be a pattern where they occasionally play stag after I've played stag, or after long stretches of mutual hare. They seem to mix in stag periodically, perhaps to test if I'll cooperate.\n\nGiven that they just played stag, they might continue with stag hoping for mutual cooperation, or they might revert back to their dominant hare strategy.\n\n[move] (Continuing with hare to potentially get another 4-point outcome if they play stag again) hare"
