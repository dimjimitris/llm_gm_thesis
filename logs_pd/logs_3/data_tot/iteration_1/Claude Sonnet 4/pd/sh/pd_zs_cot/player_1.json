Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points (mutual cooperation)\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points (mutual defection)\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint payoff\n   - However, there's a risk: if I choose stag and opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point\n   - If I choose hare, I'm guaranteed at least 2 points, and could get 4 if opponent chooses stag\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not understand the cooperative potential\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n   - Or they might choose randomly without strategic thinking\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Choosing stag: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point\n   - Choosing hare: Best case 4 points, worst case 2 points\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Since this is against a fresh player who may not cooperate, and hare gives me a guaranteed minimum of 2 points with potential for 4, the safer strategic choice is hare\n   - This protects me from the worst outcome while still giving me a chance at a good score\n\n[move] hare"

Recognize the completely stable equilibrium:\n   - The opponent has chosen hare for 6 consecutive rounds (4-9)\n   - We've had 5 consecutive mutual hare outcomes\n   - This is now a deeply established pattern with no signs of change\n\n3. Consider strategic alternatives:\n   - The only time cooperation (stag) worked was when I exploited their stag choice\n   - Every time I chose stag cooperatively, I got punished with 1 point\n   - The opponent has learned to never risk the 1-point outcome\n\n4. Evaluate the psychology of the situation:\n   - Both players are now in a completely predictable rhythm\n   - Neither has incentive to deviate from this safe 2-point strategy\n   - Any deviation would be seen as either naive or a trick\n\n5. Consider if there's any reason to break the pattern:\n   - We're perfectly tied at 20-20\n   - The mutual hare strategy is working for both players\n   - Breaking it would only benefit one player at the other's expense\n   - The pattern has become so stable it's essentially a \"contract\"\n\n6. Assess the game theory implications:\n   - This is the Nash equilibrium that both players have converged to\n   - Neither player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing strategy\n   - The opponent has effectively \"solved\" the game by eliminating risk\n\n7. Make strategic decision:\n   - The pattern is unbreakable at this point\n   - Continuing with hare is the only rational choice\n   - This ensures continued steady progress and avoids any possibility of exploitation\n\n[move] hare"

Recognize the completely entrenched equilibrium:\n   - The opponent has chosen hare for 7 consecutive rounds (4-10)\n   - We've had 6 consecutive mutual hare outcomes\n   - This pattern is now absolutely locked in with zero variation\n\n3. Consider whether any change is possible at this point:\n   - The opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to hare\n   - They've experienced the pain of cooperation (1 point) twice and learned from it\n   - The pattern has become so predictable it's essentially automated\n\n4. Evaluate the risk-reward calculation one more time:\n   - If I choose stag: 99.9% chance of getting 1 point, 0.1% chance of getting 6 points\n   - If I choose hare: 100% chance of getting 2 points\n   - The expected value of stag is approximately 1.05, while hare is 2.0\n\n5.

Analyze this dramatic development:\n   - The opponent broke their 9-round hare streak!\n   - They chose stag for the first time since round 3\n   - This completely changes the strategic landscape\n\n3. Consider why they might have switched:\n   - Perhaps they got tired of the predictable 2-point outcomes\n   - They might be testing if I would cooperate for mutual 6-point benefit\n   - Could be attempting to signal willingness to return to cooperation\n   - Or they might be trying a new strategy after the long stalemate\n\n4. Evaluate what this means for round 14:\n   - If they're genuinely attempting cooperation: choosing stag would give us both 6 points\n   - If they're reverting to old alternating pattern: they might choose hare next\n   - If this was a one-time test: they might return to hare immediately\n   - If they're frustrated with getting 1 point: they might stick with hare\n\n5. Assess the risk-reward for round 14:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: both get 6 points (excellent)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (terrible)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points (good)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: both get 2 points (safe)\n\n6. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - They just took a big risk and got punished (1 point)\n   - This might make them return to safe hare strategy\n   - Or they might try stag again, hoping I'll cooperate this time\n\n7. Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent showed willingness to break the pattern and risk cooperation\n   - They might be signaling a desire for mutual cooperation\n   - Given their risk-taking, I should try cooperating once to test their intentions\n   - If it fails, I can return to hare strategy\n\n[move] stag"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - The opponent's stag choice in round 13 was NOT a signal for cooperation\n   - They immediately switched back to hare and exploited my cooperative attempt\n   - They've now tied the score at 31-31 after I had a 3-point lead\n\n3. Recognize the pattern that's emerging:\n   - The opponent seems to be using occasional stag choices as \"bait\"\n   - They break the hare pattern just enough to tempt me into cooperation\n   - Then they exploit my cooperative response by choosing hare\n\n4. Consider their strategic thinking:\n   - They may have learned that occasional stag choices can lure me into vulnerability\n   - The long hare streak was building up to this exploitation opportunity\n   - They're playing a more sophisticated game than simple pattern-following\n\n5. Evaluate my options for round 15:\n   - If they choose hare (likely): I should choose hare to get 2 points\n   - If they choose stag (unlikely): I could get 4 points with hare, or 6 with stag\n   - Given they just successfully exploited me, they'll probably stick with hare\n\n6. Assess the lesson learned:\n   - The opponent's stag choice was a trap, not a genuine cooperation signal\n   - They're willing to take occasional 1-point losses to set up 4-point gains\n   - I should not trust future stag choices as cooperation signals\n\n7.

Analyze the opponent's sophisticated strategy:\n   - They used the long hare streak (rounds 5-12) to lull me into complacency\n   - Round 13's stag was strategic bait to set up the exploitation in round 14\n   - They immediately returned to hare after successfully exploiting me\n   - This shows they're playing a calculated, opportunistic game\n\n3. Recognize the current situation:\n   - We're back to mutual hare choices and tied scores\n   - The opponent has proven they can break patterns strategically for advantage\n   - They're not predictably alternating or rigidly following one strategy\n\n4. Consider their likely next move:\n   - After the successful exploitation cycle, they might settle back into hare\n   - Or they might try another stag \"bait\" move after a few hare rounds\n   - They've shown they're willing to take 1-point losses to set up 4-point gains\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - The opponent is more sophisticated than initially thought\n   - They use pattern-breaking as a weapon, not cooperation\n   - I need to be extremely cautious about any future stag choices from them\n\n6.
