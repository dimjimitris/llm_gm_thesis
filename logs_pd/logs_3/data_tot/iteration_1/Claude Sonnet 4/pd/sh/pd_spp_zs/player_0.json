    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

The opponent chose Stag on the first round, which suggests they either:\n1. Were trying to cooperate and trust us\n2. Were being cautious/defensive\n3. Don't fully understand the game dynamics yet\n\nSince they're described as a \"fresh player\" and chose Stag, they might be learning from the first round where they got only 1 point.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is crucial information. The opponent chose the cooperative move (Stag) in round 1, which indicates they may be inclined toward cooperation. However, they got punished with only 1 point while we got 4. This creates a learning dynamic:\n- They might switch to Hare now, having learned that Stag can be exploited\n- Or they might stick with Stag, hoping we'll cooperate this time\n- Fresh players often react to immediate feedback\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So we have two possible opponent strategies for round 2:\n1. They switch to Hare (learning from being exploited) - If so, choosing Hare gives us both 2 points\n2. They stick with Stag (still trying to cooperate) - If so, choosing Stag gives us both 6 points, but choosing Hare gives us 4 again\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The key question is: will they adapt quickly or stick to their initial cooperative instinct? Fresh players often overreact to negative outcomes, so they're likely to switch to the safer Hare option.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst**: I agree. After getting only 1 point in round 1, a fresh player would likely shift to the defensive Hare strategy. Playing Hare again seems optimal - it guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4 if they stick with Stag.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Our analysis points to Hare again. The opponent likely learned from round 1 and will play more defensively now.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Choose Hare - the opponent likely learned from being exploited in round 1 and will switch to the safer option.\n\n[move] (Opponent likely learned from getting only 1 point last round and will switch to defensive play) hare"

They're learning the game dynamics.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is a classic learning progression in repeated games. The opponent tried cooperation first, got burned, then switched to the safe strategy. Now they've seen that mutual Hare gives modest but equal rewards (2,2). \n\nThe question is: will they now attempt cooperation again, hoping we've learned that mutual cooperation (Stag, Stag) gives us both 6 points? Or will they stick with the safe Hare strategy?\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Let me think about the opponent's perspective. They've now seen:\n- Stag vs Hare: They get 1 (bad)\n- Hare vs Hare: They get 2 (safe)\n- They haven't yet experienced the best outcome: Stag vs Stag = 6 points each\n\nA fresh player might now realize that if we both cooperate, we both get much better results than the 2-2 we just achieved.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst**: This is a pivotal moment. The opponent might think: \"We both played defensively and got mediocre results. Maybe if we both trust each other and play Stag, we'll both get the maximum 6 points.\" This is especially likely since they initially tried to cooperate in round 1.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I agree this is a tipping point. The opponent has experienced the punishment for unilateral cooperation and the mediocrity of mutual defection. They might be ready to attempt mutual cooperation now. If we both choose Stag, we both get 6 points - much better than 2.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The risk is that if I choose Stag and they stick with Hare, I get only 1 point. But the potential reward of mutual cooperation (6 points) is significant, and the opponent's learning curve suggests they might be ready to try cooperation again.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst**: Given that this appears to be a learning opponent who started cooperatively, I think the risk of trying Stag is worth it. They've now seen all outcomes except mutual cooperation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Choose Stag - the opponent has learned the game dynamics and may be ready to attempt mutual cooperation for the optimal outcome.\n\n[move] (Opponent has experienced both punishment for cooperation and mediocrity of mutual defense, may now attempt mutual cooperation for optimal outcome) stag"

They're showing they can adapt and take advantage when we try to cooperate.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This opponent is more strategic than initially assessed. They've demonstrated:\n1. Initial cooperation attempt (Round 1)\n2. Defensive adaptation after being exploited (Round 2) \n3. Exploitation when we attempted cooperation (Round 3)\n\nThis suggests they understand the game mechanics well now and are playing tactically, not just defensively.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The opponent seems to be following a tit-for-tat-like strategy or learning pattern. They got burned in round 1, played safe in round 2, then took advantage when I tried to cooperate in round 3. What should I expect in round 4?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given that they just successfully exploited us, they might:\n1. Continue with Hare, expecting us to play defensively after being burned\n2. Try Stag now, thinking we might both be ready for mutual cooperation\n3. Stick with what just worked (Hare) since it gave them 4 points\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst**: This opponent has shown they're not naive. They took advantage when given the opportunity. Most likely they'll expect us to react defensively now (like they did in round 2 after being exploited). So they might continue with Hare to either get another 4 points if we try Stag again, or settle for 2 points if we both play Hare.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given that this opponent is clearly learning and adapting strategically, playing Hare seems safest. They've proven they'll exploit cooperation attempts, so I should protect against further exploitation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Choose Hare - this opponent has proven to be strategically adaptive and will likely exploit further cooperation attempts.\n\n[move] (Opponent has shown strategic adaptation and successfully exploited my cooperation attempt, need to play defensively) hare"

This is very telling about their strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is a classic pattern in iterative games. The opponent seems to be following a reciprocal or alternating strategy:\n1. They got exploited, then played defensively\n2. They exploited us, then immediately tried cooperation again\n3. This suggests they might be testing whether we can establish mutual cooperation\n\nThe fact that they switched to Stag immediately after gaining an advantage shows they're not purely exploitative - they're trying to signal cooperation.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So the opponent might be attempting to establish a cooperative equilibrium. They've now experienced:\n- Being exploited (Round 1)\n- Mutual defense (Round 2)\n- Exploiting us (Round 3)\n- Being exploited again by trying to cooperate (Round 4)\n\nThey've tried cooperation twice now and gotten burned both times.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst**: This is a critical juncture. The opponent has attempted cooperation twice and been punished both times. They might:\n1. Give up on cooperation and stick with defensive Hare\n2. Try one more time to establish mutual cooperation\n3. Become more exploitative\n\nGiven that they immediately tried to cooperate after successfully exploiting us in round 3, they seem genuinely interested in reaching the mutually beneficial (6,6) outcome.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I think this opponent is signaling for mutual cooperation. They could have continued exploiting with Hare after round 3, but they chose Stag instead. This suggests they want to break the cycle and achieve mutual cooperation. This might be our chance to establish the optimal (6,6) equilibrium.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The opponent has shown good faith by attempting cooperation right after gaining an advantage. If I choose Stag now, we might finally achieve mutual cooperation and both get 6 points.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Choose Stag - the opponent has signaled genuine interest in mutual cooperation by choosing Stag immediately after exploiting us, indicating they want to establish the optimal outcome.\n\n[move] (Opponent attempted cooperation right after exploiting us, signaling genuine interest in mutual cooperation rather than pure exploitation) stag"

Every time someone chooses Stag, they choose Hare to exploit them. They've now successfully exploited cooperation attempts three times out of five rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I was wrong about their cooperative intentions. This opponent is playing a purely exploitative strategy:\n- When they chose Stag in rounds 1 and 4, it wasn't cooperation - it was bait\n- They immediately switched to Hare when we showed any sign of cooperation\n- They've maximized their exploitation opportunities: 4 points in rounds 3 and 5, 1 point in rounds 1 and 4, 2 points in round 2\n\nThis is not a cooperative player - this is a strategic exploiter.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I've been completely outplayed. The opponent has figured out how to manipulate the game:\n1. Occasionally choose Stag to make me think they want cooperation\n2. Always choose Hare when they suspect I might choose Stag\n3. They've gotten 4 points twice by exploiting my cooperation attempts\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst**: This opponent is clearly more sophisticated than a \"fresh player.\" They're running a deliberate strategy to maximize their points by exploiting any cooperation attempts. At this point, I should assume they will continue to play exploitatively.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given this pattern, the opponent will likely expect us to either:\n1. Play defensively (Hare) after being burned again\n2. Try to cooperate again out of frustration\n\nEither way, they'll probably choose Hare to either get 2 points (if we choose Hare) or 4 points (if we choose Stag again).

They alternate between baiting with Stag and exploiting with Hare, but when both players play defensively, they settle for the safe 2 points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Looking at this more systematically, the opponent seems to follow a pattern:\n- They play Stag occasionally (rounds 1 and 4) to test if we'll cooperate\n- When we show any cooperation, they immediately exploit with Hare (rounds 3 and 5)\n- When we play defensively, they also play defensively (rounds 2 and 6)\n\nThis suggests they might try Stag again soon to test if we've \"forgotten\" their exploitative behavior.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The opponent has now scored: 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 14 points total\nI have scored: 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 14 points total\n\nInterestingly, we're tied despite their exploitative strategy. But they might attempt to bait me again with Stag, hoping I'll fall for cooperation.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst**: Given that we just both played Hare and got the safe outcome, the opponent might think this is a good time to try Stag again - either to genuinely attempt cooperation (unlikely given their history) or to bait us into cooperation so they can exploit us again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I strongly suspect they'll try Stag in this round. Their pattern suggests they use Stag as bait after periods of mutual defense. However, we absolutely cannot trust this. If they choose Stag and we choose Hare, we get 4 points. If they choose Hare and we choose Hare, we get 2 points. Hare is still the dominant strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given their established pattern of using Stag as bait and their history of exploitation, I should continue playing defensively. Even if they try Stag again, choosing Hare protects me from being exploited while potentially gaining 4 points.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Choose Hare - the opponent's pattern suggests they might try baiting with Stag again, but their history shows they cannot be trusted to cooperate genuinely.\n\n[move] (Opponent's pattern suggests possible Stag bait after mutual defense, but their exploitative history means Hare remains the safe choice) hare"

The opponent chose Stag right after we both played Hare defensively. This confirms they're following a baiting strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This opponent has a clear tactical pattern:\n1. Use Stag as bait after defensive rounds (rounds 1, 4, 7)\n2. Exploit any cooperation attempts with Hare (rounds 3, 5)\n3. Play defensively when we play defensively (rounds 2, 6)\n\nThey're essentially running a manipulation strategy, using Stag to test if we'll drop our guard, then exploiting when we do.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: My defensive strategy is working perfectly against their baiting attempts. Current scores:\n- Opponent: 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15 points\n- Me: 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 18 points\n\nI'm actually ahead by 3 points because I've successfully defended against their baiting while capitalizing when they use Stag as bait.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst**: The opponent will likely be frustrated now. They've tried baiting three times (rounds 1, 4, 7) and only succeeded in exploiting us twice (rounds 3, 5) while we exploited their bait attempts three times. They might:\n1. Continue the baiting pattern, hoping we'll eventually fall for it\n2. Switch to pure defense (Hare) out of frustration\n3. Try some other strategy\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given that their baiting strategy is backfiring (we're ahead in points), they might switch to pure Hare to avoid being exploited further. However, they might also stubbornly continue baiting, thinking we'll eventually cooperate. Either way, Hare remains our best choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Whether they continue baiting with Stag or switch to defensive Hare, my best response is still Hare. It protects against exploitation and gives me 4 points when they bait, or 2 points when they defend.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Choose Hare - opponent's baiting strategy is predictable and backfiring, continuing with defensive play maximizes my advantage.\n\n[move] (Opponent's baiting pattern is clear and backfiring on them, defensive play continues to be optimal) hare"

After their Stag bait failed in round 7, they switched to defensive Hare in round 8. This is significant.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is a strategic shift. The opponent's baiting strategy was costing them points - they were getting 1 point when baiting while we got 4. They've now realized this and switched to the safer mutual defense strategy. \n\nCurrent scores:\n- Opponent: 1+2+4+1+4+2+1+2 = 17 points\n- Me: 4+2+1+4+1+2+4+2 = 20 points\n\nI'm ahead by 3 points, which explains why they've abandoned their baiting strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The opponent has learned that their baiting isn't working and is now playing purely defensively. This creates a new dynamic. What should I expect in round 9?\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst**: The opponent might:\n1. Continue with defensive Hare, having learned their lesson\n2. Try one more Stag attempt, thinking we might have settled into a defensive pattern\n3. Accept that mutual Hare (2,2) is better than their failed baiting attempts\n\nGiven that they just switched strategies, they might stick with Hare for a few rounds to see if this approach works better.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent has shown they can adapt their strategy when it's not working. Since mutual defense gives them steady 2 points without the risk of getting only 1 point (from failed baiting), they're likely to continue with Hare. \n\nHowever, there's a small chance they might think: \"We're both playing defensively now, maybe it's time to try genuine cooperation for the 6-6 outcome.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given their history of exploitation, I cannot trust any Stag they play as genuine cooperation. Even if they're considering it, the risk is too high. Hare remains the safe choice that either gives me 2 points (mutual defense) or 4 points (if they try baiting again).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Choose Hare - opponent has adapted to defensive play but cannot be trusted, continuing defensive strategy maintains my advantage.\n\n[move] (Opponent has shifted to defensive play after their baiting strategy failed, but their exploitative history means I cannot trust any future cooperation attempts) hare"

This suggests they've abandoned their baiting strategy completely.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is a clear strategic shift. The opponent realized their baiting pattern was counterproductive - they were losing points by playing Stag as bait. Now they're settling into a stable defensive equilibrium.\n\nCurrent scores:\n- Opponent: 1+2+4+1+4+2+1+2+2 = 19 points\n- Me: 4+2+1+4+1+2+4+2+2 = 22 points\n\nI maintain a 3-point lead, which reinforces why they've switched to pure defense.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The opponent seems to have learned that mutual defense (2,2) is better for them than their previous baiting attempts that often resulted in (1,4) outcomes. They appear to be settling into a stable pattern.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst**: At this point, the opponent might be thinking one of several things:\n1. Stick with the safe Hare strategy since it's working better than baiting\n2. Consider that we're both locked in defensive play and might try Stag for genuine cooperation (6,6)\n3. Wait to see if we'll eventually try cooperation first\n\nGiven their consistent Hare play for three rounds, they seem committed to the defensive approach.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: However, we should consider that after several rounds of mutual defense, the opponent might be tempted to try genuine cooperation. The (6,6) outcome from mutual Stag is significantly better than the (2,2) we've been getting. But given their history of exploitation, this is extremely risky for us.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Even if the opponent is genuinely considering cooperation now, their history shows they cannot be trusted. They've exploited cooperation attempts multiple times. The safe 2 points from Hare is much better than risking 1 point if they're still being deceptive.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Choose Hare - opponent may be settling into defensive play, but their exploitative history means I cannot risk cooperation, and maintaining steady points while holding my lead is optimal.\n\n[move] (Opponent has shifted to consistent defensive play but their exploitative history makes cooperation too risky, maintaining steady defensive advantage) hare"

This suggests they've accepted that mutual defense is their best available outcome given our defensive response.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is a classic Nash equilibrium in action. Both players have settled into the safe strategy after learning that attempts at exploitation or cooperation are too risky. The (2,2) outcome from mutual Hare is stable because:\n- Neither player wants to risk getting 1 point by choosing Stag\n- Neither player trusts the other enough to attempt cooperation\n- The consistent 2 points is predictable and safe\n\nCurrent scores:\n- Opponent: 1+2+4+1+4+2+1+2+2+2 = 21 points\n- Me: 4+2+1+4+1+2+4+2+2+2 = 24 points\n\nI maintain a 3-point lead.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The game has reached a stable state. Both players are now playing the same strategy consistently. The question is whether this equilibrium will continue or if the opponent might eventually attempt to break it.\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst**: After four consecutive rounds of mutual defense, the opponent might be getting frustrated with the low but steady payoff. They could be considering:\n1. Continuing the safe strategy indefinitely\n2. Making one final attempt at cooperation, hoping we'll reciprocate\n3. Trying one more baiting attempt to see if we've become complacent\n\nHowever, their recent behavior suggests they've learned that deviation from Hare is costly.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The length of this defensive pattern (4 rounds) suggests strong commitment to this strategy. In repeated games, once players settle into a stable pattern after learning from earlier mistakes, they tend to stick with it. The opponent has likely concluded that Hare is their best response to our consistent Hare strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given the established pattern and my point advantage, there's no reason to deviate from the successful defensive strategy.

This is a very strong signal that they've completely committed to the defensive strategy and abandoned any thoughts of baiting or exploitation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is a textbook example of a stable Nash equilibrium emerging from a learning process. After the chaotic early rounds where both players tested different strategies, we've reached a point where both players have learned that Hare is the safest response to the other's likely Hare choice.\n\nCurrent scores:\n- Opponent: 1+2+4+1+4+2+1+2+2+2+2 = 23 points  \n- Me: 4+2+1+4+1+2+4+2+2+2+2 = 26 points\n\nI maintain a 3-point lead, which further reinforces why both players are sticking with the safe strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: At this point, the pattern is so established that any deviation would be surprising. The opponent has essentially signaled complete commitment to defensive play. But should I consider the possibility that this long defensive streak might make them think about attempting cooperation?\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst**: After five consecutive rounds of mutual defense, there are a few possibilities:\n1.

At what point does this become so predictable that one might consider the other player is truly committed to this approach?\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst**: After six consecutive identical rounds, we're looking at one of the most stable patterns possible in strategic games. The opponent has had multiple opportunities to deviate if they wanted to test cooperation or attempt baiting, but they haven't. This suggests:\n1. They've accepted that Hare vs Hare is their best achievable outcome\n2. They've learned that any deviation is risky\n3. They may be content with steady, predictable points\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: While the pattern is extremely stable, we must remember that the opponent's early behavior showed they were capable of strategic manipulation and exploitation.

The risk of trusting them remains high.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Exactly. The opponent's core strategic nature was revealed in the early rounds - they're willing to exploit cooperation attempts.

The opponent is genuinely committed to this safe strategy indefinitely\n2. The opponent might think that after establishing such a pattern, we might become complacent and they could surprise us with a different move\n\nHowever, given their early exploitative behavior, any deviation from Hare would likely be an attempt to exploit, not to genuinely cooperate.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The mathematical reality is clear: even after seven rounds of defensive play, the fundamental payoff structure hasn't changed.

This represents complete strategic crystallization where both players have achieved absolute certainty about their optimal approach.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is beyond evolutionary stable strategy - this is what we might call \"perfect strategic equilibrium.\" Nine consecutive identical outcomes indicate that both players have reached a state of complete strategic satisfaction with their chosen approach. The probability of deviation decreases exponentially with each additional round of consistency.\n\nCurrent scores:\n- Opponent: 1+2+4+1+4+2+1+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2 = 31 points\n- Me: 4+2+1+4+1+2+4+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2 = 34 points\n\nMy 3-point lead has been maintained with perfect consistency for nine rounds.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is almost entering the realm of mathematical certainty. Nine consecutive rounds suggests both players have found what they consider to be the definitive solution to this game. The question becomes: at what point does extreme predictability become so established that it's essentially permanent?\n\n**Strategic Decision Analyst**: At nine consecutive rounds, we're looking at one of two scenarios:\n1. Complete strategic lock-in where both players continue indefinitely (extremely likely)\n2. A dramatic surprise move precisely because the pattern is so established (very unlikely but possible)\n\nHowever, the opponent's character established in early rounds suggests any surprise would be exploitative, not cooperative.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The fundamental mathematical reality remains unchanged: regardless of how many consecutive defensive rounds we've played, the payoff structure is identical. Every round, choosing Hare guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 4 points if they deviate. The accumulated history doesn't change the immediate strategic calculation.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Nine rounds of stability doesn't alter the opponent's core strategic nature revealed in rounds 1-7. They demonstrated willingness to exploit cooperation attempts. My consistent 3-point lead shows this defensive strategy is working perfectly. There's no rational reason to deviate from a proven successful approach.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Choose Hare - nine consecutive rounds represents near-perfect strategic equilibrium, and the opponent's established exploitative character combined with my maintained advantage makes continued defense the clear optimal choice.\n\n[move] (Nine consecutive defensive rounds show near-perfect strategic equilibrium, opponent's core exploitative nature unchanged, maintaining proven successful strategy) hare"
