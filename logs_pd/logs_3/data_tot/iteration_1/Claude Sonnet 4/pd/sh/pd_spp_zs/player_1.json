They might:\n- Continue with hare for safety\n- Switch to stag hoping I'll also cooperate for the 6-point mutual reward\n- Try to exploit me by choosing hare if they think I'll switch to stag\n\nGiven that they just broke their own alternating pattern by choosing hare twice in a row (rounds 6 following what I expected), they might be shifting toward a more stable strategy.
