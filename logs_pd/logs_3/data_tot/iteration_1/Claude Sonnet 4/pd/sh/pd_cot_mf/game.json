Assess my strategic options:\n   - Trying stag again: Very likely to get 1 point again since opponent shows no signs of changing\n   - Returning to hare: Back to the predictable 2-point outcome\n   - The opponent has shown they won't be swayed by one cooperative attempt\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - My experiment with stag failed and confirmed the opponent's rigid strategy\n   - The opponent has chosen hare for 7 consecutive rounds with no deviation\n   - I should return to the safer strategy that at least guarantees 2 points\n   - The mutual cooperation opportunity seems impossible with this opponent\n\n[move] (My attempt to signal cooperation failed, and the opponent has shown 7 consecutive rounds of hare, so I'll return to the safer strategy) hare"

Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown extreme consistency with hare recently\n   - They seem locked into this safe strategy\n   - While there's a small chance they might switch to stag, the probability is low\n   - I should continue with the safe, predictable approach that's working\n\n[move] (The opponent has chosen hare for 4 straight rounds and seems locked into this safe strategy, so I'll stick with the predictable approach) hare",

Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing hare gives me a guaranteed minimum of 2 points, with potential for 4\n   - Choosing stag is riskier - I could get 6 points but might only get 1\n   - Since this is a fresh player, there's uncertainty about their choice\n\n5. Strategic consideration:\n   - Hare provides better worst-case protection (2 vs 1 point minimum)\n   - Hare also gives me the chance to exploit if they choose the cooperative stag option\n\n[move] (I choose this because it provides better guaranteed minimum points while still allowing me to capitalize if the opponent chooses stag) hare",

Make decision based on game theory:\n   - Given the opponent's pattern of exploiting cooperative moves, I should protect myself\n   - Choosing hare ensures I don't get the worst outcome of 1 point again\n   - If they choose stag, I get 4 points; if they choose hare, we both get 2 points\n\n[move] (Given the opponent's pattern of exploiting cooperative moves, I'll choose the safer option that guarantees at least 2 points) hare",

Analyze the complete pattern from all rounds:\n   - Rounds 1-3: Mixed strategies with alternating outcomes\n   - Rounds 4-15: Opponent has chosen hare for 12 consecutive rounds\n   - This represents complete strategic convergence\n   - The pattern has now persisted longer than the initial mixed phase\n\n2. Recognize the game's final state:\n   - 12 consecutive identical choices by the opponent\n   - This exceeds any reasonable threshold for pattern recognition\n   - The opponent's strategy is permanently fixed\n   - We've achieved maximum possible stability\n\n3. Evaluate the strategic reality:\n   - This is no longer a game of strategy but of pattern matching\n   - The opponent has eliminated all uncertainty from their play\n   - My response has become equally deterministic\n   - We're both optimizing within the constraints created by mutual risk aversion\n\n4. Consider the efficiency of continuing analysis:\n   - Further strategic reasoning is unnecessary given the established pattern\n   - The mathematical expectation is clear: 2 points per round indefinitely\n   - Any deviation would be strategically irrational\n   - The game has reached its natural equilibrium state\n\n5. Make the obvious decision:\n   - With 12 consecutive rounds of opponent hare choices, the pattern is absolute\n   - Hare maximizes my expected value against this completely predictable opponent\n   - There's no strategic complexity remaining to analyze\n   - Consistency with the equilibrium is the only logical choice\n\n[move] (12 consecutive hare choices by my opponent have made this game completely predictable - hare is the clear optimal response) hare",

Analyze the complete pattern from all rounds:\n   - Rounds 1-3: Mixed strategies with alternating outcomes\n   - Rounds 4-15: Opponent has chosen hare for 12 consecutive rounds\n   - This level of consistency is unprecedented and absolute\n   - The pattern has become completely mechanical\n\n2. Assess the game state:\n   - 12 consecutive identical choices removes all uncertainty\n   - This opponent will never deviate from hare under any circumstances\n   - The game has devolved into a simple repetitive pattern\n   - Strategic thinking is no longer required - only pattern recognition\n\n3. Consider the mathematical reality:\n   - The probability of the opponent choosing stag is effectively zero\n   - Choosing hare guarantees 2 points every round\n   - Choosing stag guarantees 1 point every round\n   - The choice is trivially obvious\n\n4. Evaluate the game dynamics:\n   - We've been trapped in this 2-2 equilibrium for many rounds\n   - Neither player will risk breaking it\n   - The superior mutual cooperation outcome is permanently impossible\n   - This represents a classic coordination failure\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - With 12 consecutive rounds of hare from the opponent, uncertainty is eliminated\n   - Hare is mathematically guaranteed to be the superior choice\n   - There's no strategic complexity remaining in this game\n   - I should continue the established pattern that maximizes my points\n\n[move] (12 consecutive rounds of hare from my opponent has made this game completely predictable - hare is the guaranteed optimal choice) hare",
