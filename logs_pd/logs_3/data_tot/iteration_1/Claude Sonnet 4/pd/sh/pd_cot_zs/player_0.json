Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key insight is that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest joint payoff, but it's risky because if the other player defects to hare, I only get 1 point.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I need to consider their likely behavior:\n   - They might not understand the cooperative strategy yet\n   - They might choose hare as a \"safe\" option since it guarantees at least 2 points\n   - They might choose randomly\n\n4. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points (good outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 points (safe outcome)\n\n5. Against a fresh player who might not coordinate, choosing hare seems safer as it protects against the worst outcome while still allowing for a decent payoff if they choose stag.\n\n[move] hare"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I chose hare, opponent chose stag\n   - I got 4 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This means my opponent was willing to take the cooperative/risky move\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They were willing to choose stag (the cooperative move)\n   - They might be trying to establish mutual cooperation\n   - They got punished with only 1 point for their cooperative attempt\n   - They might now be frustrated or more cautious\n\n3. Analyzing the opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might stick with stag if they believe in long-term cooperation\n   - They might switch to hare after being \"burned\" by my hare choice\n   - They might expect me to reciprocate their cooperative gesture\n\n4. My strategic options:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: We both get 6 points (mutual benefit)\n   - If I choose stag and they switch to hare: I get 1 point (bad for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag again: I get 4 points (good for me but unfair)\n   - If I choose hare and they also switch to hare: We both get 2 points\n\n5. Since my opponent showed willingness to cooperate in round 1, and I benefited from their trust, the strategic and fair move would be to reciprocate with stag. This could establish mutual cooperation for future rounds.\n\n[move] stag"

Analyzing the opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might return to stag now that they've \"gotten even\"\n   - They might continue with hare if they think I'll try to exploit again\n   - They might be looking for signals that I want to cooperate\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives us both 6 points - the best outcome\n   - Continuing the conflict (both hare) gives us both only 2 points - wasteful\n   - If I try to exploit again with hare while they cooperate, I risk another retaliation cycle\n\n5. Since we're now \"even\" and both have learned that exploitation leads to retaliation, this might be the perfect moment to establish mutual cooperation. The opponent has shown they can retaliate, so they've demonstrated strength. Now choosing stag would signal a genuine desire to cooperate.\n\n[move] stag"

Review the recent pattern:\n   - Round 7: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 8: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 9: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 10: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Total: I have 22 points, opponent has 25 points\n\n2. Analyzing opponent's recent behavior:\n   - Last 4 rounds they chose: stag, hare, hare, hare\n   - They seem to be favoring hare more frequently now\n   - 3 out of last 4 rounds were hare\n   - They may have shifted to a more defensive/safe strategy\n\n3. Strategic assessment:\n   - I'm still behind by 3 points (22 vs 25)\n   - If they continue choosing hare frequently, mutual hare gives us both 2 points\n   - This doesn't help me catch up - I need higher scoring rounds\n   - To catch up, I need either:\n     - Me: hare, Them: stag \u2192 I get 4 points\n     - Me: stag, Them: stag \u2192 We both get 6 points\n\n4. Risk analysis for next round:\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 (safe but doesn't help me catch up)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 4 (helps me catch up)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 (makes me fall further behind)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 6 (great outcome, helps me catch up)\n\n5. Given their recent preference for hare, and my need to catch up, choosing hare seems safer while still giving me a chance for 4 points if they surprisingly choose stag.\n\n[move] hare"

Pattern analysis - opponent's recent moves:\n   - Last 4 rounds they chose: hare, hare, hare, stag\n   - After 3 consecutive hare choices, they switched to stag\n   - This could indicate they're alternating between periods of safety (hare) and risk/cooperation (stag)\n   - Or they might be trying to be unpredictable after I kept choosing hare\n\n3. Strategic situation:\n   - We're now tied at 26 points each\n   - The game seems to be in a balanced state\n   - My opponent just gave me 4 points by choosing stag while I chose hare\n   - They might be testing if I'll reciprocate with cooperation\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - They just chose stag and got only 1 point\n   - They might return to hare for safety\n   - Or they might stick with stag hoping I'll cooperate for mutual 6 points\n   - Given the tie, they might be more willing to risk cooperation\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they choose hare (likely after getting burned): I get 4 with hare, 1 with stag\n   - If they choose stag (cooperative signal): I get 2 with hare, 6 with stag\n   - Since we're tied and they just took a risk with stag, this might be a good moment to reciprocate cooperation and go for the mutual 6-point outcome.\n\n[move] stag"

Pattern recognition - alternating exploitation:\n   - Round 11: They chose stag, I chose hare \u2192 I exploited them for 4 points\n   - Round 12: I chose stag, they chose hare \u2192 They exploited me for 4 points\n   - This looks like they're playing a \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation strategy\n   - When one player gets exploited, they retaliate by exploiting back\n\n3. Analyzing opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They just successfully retaliated after I exploited them in round 11\n   - They might expect me to retaliate back now\n   - Or they might return to a safer strategy like hare\n   - They're ahead by 3 points again (30 vs 27)\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - I'm behind again and need to catch up\n   - If they expect me to retaliate with hare (to exploit their potential stag), they might choose hare for safety\n   - If both of us choose hare, we both get 2 points (doesn't help me catch up)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag, I get 4 points (helps me catch up)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1 point (makes it worse)\n\n5. Given their recent behavior of retaliating and then being cautious, and my need to catch up, choosing hare gives me the best chance to either get 4 points (if they risk stag) or at least 2 points (if they play it safe).\n\n[move] hare"

Review the recent pattern:\n   - Round 10: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 11: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 12: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 13: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Total: I have 29 points, opponent has 32 points\n\n2. Pattern analysis - cycles of mutual safety:\n   - After exploitation exchanges, we both tend to retreat to hare\n   - Round 10: Both hare (mutual safety)\n   - Round 11-12: Exploitation cycle (4-1, then 1-4)\n   - Round 13: Both hare again (back to mutual safety)\n   - This suggests a pattern of: safety \u2192 risk/exploitation \u2192 retaliation \u2192 back to safety\n\n3. Current strategic situation:\n   - I'm still behind by 3 points (29 vs 32)\n   - We just had a \"reset\" round with mutual hare\n   - The opponent might be willing to take risks again after this safe round\n   - Or they might stick with hare since they're ahead and playing it safe\n\n4. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (safe but doesn't help me catch up)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (helps me catch up significantly)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (makes me fall further behind)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (best outcome, helps me catch up)\n\n5. Since they're ahead, they might be more willing to take the risk of stag for a potential big payoff. Given the cyclical pattern we've established, this might be when they switch back to stag. However, the risk of getting only 1 point is high. I'll stick with hare to either get a safe 2 or catch up with 4 if they risk stag.\n\n[move] hare"

Review the recent pattern:\n   - Round 11: I chose hare, opponent chose stag \u2192 I got 4, opponent got 1\n   - Round 12: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1, opponent got 4\n   - Round 13: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Round 14: I chose hare, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 2, opponent got 2\n   - Total: I have 31 points, opponent has 34 points\n\n2. Stagnation analysis:\n   - We've now had 2 consecutive rounds of mutual hare\n   - Both getting 2 points each round maintains the 3-point gap\n   - My opponent is content to play it safe since they're ahead\n   - This mutual hare pattern isn't helping me catch up at all\n\n3. Strategic reality check:\n   - I'm still behind by 3 points (31 vs 34)\n   - If we keep choosing mutual hare, I'll never catch up\n   - My opponent has no incentive to change since they're winning\n   - I need to break this stalemate somehow\n\n4. Risk assessment for breaking the pattern:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get 1 point (fall to 6 points behind)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 6 points (gain 3 points, tie the game)\n   - If I stay with hare and they choose hare: I get 2 points (gap remains)\n   - If I stay with hare and they choose stag: I get 4 points (close the gap to 1)\n\n5. The key insight: I MUST take a risk to have any chance of catching up. Staying safe with hare guarantees I remain behind. Since my opponent might get comfortable with the mutual hare pattern, they might not expect me to switch to stag. It's a big risk, but it's my only path to potentially tying or winning.\n\n[move] stag"

Critical realization about my opponent's strategy:\n   - My opponent seems to have settled into a very conservative approach\n   - They're consistently choosing hare when they sense any risk\n   - They're ahead by 6 points now (38 vs 32)\n   - They have no incentive to cooperate since they're winning comfortably\n\n3. Strategic assessment:\n   - My gamble failed and I'm now in a worse position\n   - The gap has widened from 3 points to 6 points\n   - My opponent appears to be playing a \"safe when ahead\" strategy\n   - They're likely to keep choosing hare as long as they maintain their lead\n\n4.
