You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n- Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2  \n- I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n- I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\nThis is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key insight is that \"stag\" is the cooperative move that yields the highest mutual benefit (6 points each), but it's risky because if the other player defects to \"hare,\" I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might play cautiously and choose the safer \"hare\" option, which guarantees at least 2 points regardless of what I do.\n\nHowever, given that this is the first round and the fresh player might not fully grasp the strategic implications, there's a reasonable chance they could choose either move randomly or go for the cooperative \"stag.\"\n\nI'll take a calculated risk and choose stag, hoping to establish cooperation from the start and achieve the optimal outcome.\n\n[move] stag"
