Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key insight is that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest total payoff, but it's risky because if the other player defects to hare, I get only 1 point.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I need to consider their likely behavior:\n   - They might not understand the game fully\n   - They might play conservatively\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - They might go for the \"safer\" option\n\n4. Analysis of my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 6 (if they cooperate) or 1 (if they defect)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 4 (if they choose stag) or 2 (if they choose hare)\n\n5. Hare is the \"safer\" choice because it guarantees at least 2 points and could give me 4 if they choose stag. However, if we both think this way, we both get only 2 points instead of the possible 6.\n\n6. Since this is against a fresh player who might not fully grasp the strategic implications, they might lean toward the safer hare option or might randomly pick. Given the uncertainty, hare seems like the more prudent choice for this first interaction.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I should choose hare to minimize risk while maintaining decent point potential.\n\n[move] hare"

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also chose the \"safer\" option like I predicted\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me (risk-averse)\n   - They could be a rational player who also analyzed the payoffs\n\n3. Strategic considerations for Round 2:\n   - If we both continue choosing hare, we'll keep getting 2 points each\n   - The mutual cooperation (both stag) would give us 6 points each - much better\n   - But if I switch to stag and they stick with hare, I only get 1 point\n\n4. Opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They might think: \"We both played safe last round, maybe I should continue\"\n   - Or they might think: \"Maybe we can both benefit from cooperation now\"\n   - They could be testing the waters like I am\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 4 points (if they switch to stag), worst case 2 points\n   - The fact that we both chose hare suggests we might both be open to the higher mutual payoff\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - Since we both demonstrated similar conservative thinking in Round 1, there's a reasonable chance they might also consider the mutual benefit of both choosing stag\n   - This could be worth the risk, especially since continuing with hare only gives us suboptimal outcomes\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll take a calculated risk and choose stag, hoping my opponent also recognizes the mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag"

Pattern analysis across all rounds:\n   - Rounds 1-3: Initial testing phase (2, 1, 4 points for me)\n   - Rounds 4-9: Six consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (6 points each)\n   - We've maintained optimal outcomes for 6 straight rounds\n   - This is an incredibly stable and successful partnership\n\n3. Current score situation:\n   - My total: 2 + 1 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 43 points\n   - Opponent's total: 2 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 43 points\n   - Still perfectly tied, both achieving excellent cumulative scores\n\n4.

Mathematical certainty:\n   - Choosing stag: Guaranteed 6 points (optimal outcome)\n   - Choosing hare: Maximum 4 points, likely 2 points if they retaliate\n   - There is absolutely no mathematical advantage to deviating\n   - Cooperation continues to be the dominant strategy\n\n6. Behavioral analysis:\n   - My opponent has shown unwavering commitment to cooperation\n   - They've had multiple opportunities to exploit but haven't\n   - Their behavior suggests they're playing for long-term optimization\n   - Breaking this trust now would be completely unexpected and irrational\n\n7. Game theory conclusion:\n   - We've achieved what economists call \"efficient cooperation\"\n   - Both players are maximizing their individual and collective welfare\n   - This is the ideal outcome in repeated strategic interactions\n   - Any deviation would represent a failure in rational decision-making\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I should absolutely continue this outstanding cooperation streak and choose stag to maintain our perfectly optimized mutual arrangement.\n\n[move] stag"
