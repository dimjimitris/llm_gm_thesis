The pattern holds absolutely true:\n- After mutual stag cooperation, opponent exploits with hare\n- After they exploit me, they choose stag (and I exploit them back with hare)\n\nThis is now the fourth time this exact sequence has played out:\n- Rounds 2\u21923\u21924: Mutual stag, they exploit, I counter-exploit\n- Rounds 8\u21929\u219210: Mutual stag, they exploit, I counter-exploit  \n- Rounds 12\u219213\u219214: Mutual stag, they exploit, I counter-exploit\n\nMy opponent is completely predictable. They have a rigid two-move cycle after successful cooperation: exploit (hare), then get exploited (stag).\n\nBased on this pattern, they should choose hare next round since they just got exploited. This will likely lead to mutual hare (both getting 2 points), which historically has been followed by mutual stag cooperation.\n\nThe cycle seems to be: Mutual stag (6,6) \u2192 They exploit (1,4) \u2192 I counter-exploit (4,1) \u2192 Mutual hare (2,2) \u2192 Back to mutual stag (6,6)\n\nI'll choose hare to complete this cycle phase and move us toward the mutual hare that precedes cooperation.\n\n[move] (Following the established cycle pattern toward mutual hare phase) hare",

Based on the established pattern, mutual hare is always followed by mutual stag cooperation. This happened in:\n- Round 7 (both hare) \u2192 Round 8 (both stag)\n- Round 11 (both hare) \u2192 Round 12 (both stag)\n\nSo round 15 (both hare) should lead to round 16 (both stag).\n\nMy opponent appears to be locked into this rigid cycle. They seem unable or unwilling to break out of the pattern of exploiting successful cooperation, but they also consistently return to cooperation after the mutual hare \"reset\" phase.\n\nWhile this cycle isn't optimal (we lose potential points during the exploitation phases), it does guarantee that we'll achieve the maximum 6-6 payoff regularly. I'll continue with stag to maintain this predictable cycle.\n\n[move] (Continuing the established cycle by moving to the cooperation phase) stag",

The key considerations are:\n\n1. Mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest mutual payoff (6 points each)\n2. If I choose stag but the other player chooses hare, I get a very low payoff (1 point)\n3. If I choose hare, I'm guaranteed at least 2 points, and could get 4 if the other player chooses stag\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\" who I have no history with, I need to consider their likely reasoning. A fresh player might:\n- Choose the safe option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n- Choose stag hoping for mutual cooperation\n- Make a random choice\n\nGiven the risk-reward structure, choosing stag requires trust that the other player will also cooperate. However, hare provides better protection against exploitation while still offering a chance at a decent payoff.\n\n[move] (I'll choose hare as it provides better security against an unknown opponent while still maintaining decent payoff potential) hare",
