This is the third time we've achieved the optimal 6-6 outcome, and it happened immediately after mutual hare in both cases (rounds 7\u21928 and 11\u219212).\n\nHowever, I must remember what happened after round 8: my opponent exploited me in round 9 when I continued with stag. The key question is whether this pattern will repeat, or if my opponent has learned that sustained cooperation is better than the exploit-then-get-exploited cycle.\n\nGiven that we've now been through this cycle multiple times, and my opponent has experienced both sides of exploitation repeatedly, they might be ready to try sustained cooperation. But I need to be prepared for the possibility that they'll exploit again.\n\nThe challenge is that if I assume they'll exploit and choose hare, but they actually want to cooperate and choose stag, then I become the exploiter. I'll take the risk and continue with stag, hoping we can break the cycle.\n\n[move] (Hoping to establish sustained cooperation rather than repeating the exploitation cycle) stag"
