Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the key strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic coordination game similar to the \"Stag Hunt\"\n   - Stag requires cooperation and gives the highest mutual payoff (6 each)\n   - Hare is the safer choice but gives lower payoff when both choose it (2 each)\n   - There's risk in choosing stag if the opponent chooses hare (only 1 point)\n\n3. Consider the opponent is \"fresh\" (new player):\n   - Fresh players often don't understand optimal cooperation strategies\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" option (hare) to avoid getting the worst outcome\n   - They might not realize the mutual benefit of coordination on stag\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses stag: 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare: 1 point (worst for me)\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses stag: 4 points (good outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses hare: 2 points (safe outcome)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against a fresh player, choosing hare gives me either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n   - Choosing stag is risky against an inexperienced player who might not cooperate\n\nFinal decision: Given that the opponent is fresh and likely to play cautiously, I'll choose hare to either capitalize on their potential cooperation attempt or at least secure a safe outcome.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose the same safe strategy (hare) that I did\n   - This suggests they might be risk-averse or thinking similarly\n   - They avoided the risky stag move in the first round\n\n3.

Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since we both played cautiously last round, there might be an opportunity to signal cooperation\n   - The opponent might be thinking the same way - that we could both benefit from choosing stag\n   - However, there's still risk they'll stick with the safe hare strategy\n   - But the potential reward (6 vs 2) is significant\n\nFinal decision: I'll take a calculated risk and try to establish cooperation by choosing stag, hoping the opponent recognizes the mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag"

Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - We've built trust through successful coordination\n   - Continuing with stag maintains the cooperative relationship\n   - The risk of them switching to hare seems lower now that we've established cooperation\n   - If I switch to hare while they stick with stag, I get 4 points vs their 1, but this breaks trust\n\n5. Consider long-term vs short-term strategy:\n   - Short-term: Choosing hare could give me 4 points if they choose stag\n   - Long-term: Maintaining cooperation with stag-stag gives consistent 6 points\n   - Breaking cooperation could lead them to choose hare in future rounds\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The cooperative equilibrium (both choosing stag) is clearly established\n   - Breaking this trust for a short-term gain (4 vs 6) doesn't make sense\n   - Maintaining cooperation maximizes long-term point accumulation\n\nFinal decision: Continue the successful cooperation strategy.\n\n[move] stag"

Analyze the opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - Round 1: hare (cautious)\n   - Round 2: stag (cooperative) \n   - Round 3: hare (defection after establishing trust)\n   - This suggests they might be exploiting the cooperative pattern\n\n3.

Analyze the opponent's clear pattern:\n   - They exploited me twice now (rounds 3 and 5) by choosing hare when I chose stag\n   - They only chose stag once after I exploited them (round 4)\n   - They seem to be consistently choosing hare, except when retaliating\n   - This suggests they're playing a more defensive/exploitative strategy\n\n3.

Confirm the opponent's predictable strategy:\n   - They're locked into an exploitation pattern after every cooperation\n   - After round 2 cooperation: exploited me in rounds 3, 5\n   - After round 8 cooperation: exploited me in round 9\n   - They consistently follow up any mutual cooperation with exploitation attempts\n\n3. Recognize the cyclical nature:\n   - The pattern is becoming very predictable\n   - After I get exploited, I retaliate and exploit them back\n   - This creates alternating 4-1 and 1-4 outcomes\n   - Neither of us is gaining long-term advantage from this cycle\n\n4. Analyze the opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They probably expect me to continue this retaliatory pattern\n   - They might predict I'll choose stag next (to try cooperation again)\n   - Or they might expect me to choose hare (defensive/exploitative)\n   - Their pattern suggests they default to exploitation whenever possible\n\n5. Consider my strategic options:\n   - Continue the alternating exploitation cycle: predictable but neither gains advantage\n   - Try to break to mutual cooperation: historically fails with this opponent\n   - Try to force mutual defense (both hare): gives steady 2 points each\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent has proven they cannot sustain cooperation\n   - They systematically exploit cooperative attempts\n   - The alternating pattern gives me 4 points every other round vs their 4 points\n   - Since they seem to prefer exploitation, choosing hare protects me while potentially capitalizing if they try stag\n   - Based on their pattern, they might choose hare expecting me to try cooperation\n\nFinal decision: Stay defensive to avoid exploitation while potentially capitalizing on their moves.\n\n[move] hare"

Identify the emerging super-pattern:\n   - Rounds 1-2: Caution \u2192 Cooperation (hare-hare, then stag-stag)\n   - Rounds 3-6: Exploitation cycle (alternating who exploits whom)\n   - Round 7-8: Reset \u2192 Cooperation (hare-hare, then stag-stag)\n   - Rounds 9-10: Exploitation cycle again\n   - Round 11: Caution again (both hare)\n\n3. Recognize the cyclical meta-pattern:\n   - The opponent follows a predictable macro-cycle\n   - Mutual caution \u2192 Brief cooperation \u2192 Extended exploitation \u2192 Reset\n   - We're now at the \"reset\" point again (round 11 = round 7 = round 1)\n   - History suggests round 12 might mirror rounds 2 and 8 (cooperation attempt)\n\n4. Analyze the opponent's strategic approach:\n   - They seem to use cooperation as bait for exploitation cycles\n   - They allow brief \"resets\" but always return to exploitation\n   - They're sophisticated enough to recognize pattern breaks and reset points\n   - They're playing a long-term exploitation strategy with tactical cooperation\n\n5. Consider my strategic position:\n   - I've identified the opponent's meta-strategy\n   - They'll likely try cooperation next (mirroring rounds 2 and 8)\n   - But I know this will lead to another exploitation cycle\n   - I can either play into their pattern or try to break it permanently\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (but leads to exploitation cycle)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (breaks their pattern expectation)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (forces sustained mutual defense)\n   - Breaking their exploitation pattern by refusing to cooperate might force them into sustained mutual defense\n   - Sustained mutual defense (2 points each) is better than alternating exploitation (average of 2.5 points but with high variance)\n\nFinal decision: Break their exploitation pattern by refusing the cooperation bait.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze what this means for the opponent:\n   - They just got exploited when they expected cooperation\n   - This breaks their usual cycle where they cooperate once then exploit\n   - They might be confused or frustrated by my pattern break\n   - They now face a choice: continue trying cooperation, retaliate, or go defensive\n\n4. Consider the opponent's likely response:\n   - They might retaliate with hare (expecting me to try stag)\n   - They might try stag again (doubling down on cooperation)\n   - They might recognize I've figured out their pattern and go defensive\n   - Based on their previous behavior, retaliation (hare) seems most likely\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I successfully disrupted their exploitation cycle\n   - I gained an advantage (4 points) when they expected mutual cooperation\n   - Now I need to decide whether to try cooperation or stay defensive\n   - The risk is they'll retaliate, but the reward of cooperation is high\n\n6.

Notice the significant pattern change:\n   - I successfully disrupted their expected cooperation cycle in round 12\n   - Now we have two consecutive mutual hare rounds (11, 13)\n   - This suggests the opponent may have shifted strategy\n   - The exploitation cycles may be breaking down\n\n3. Analyze what this means:\n   - The opponent chose hare after being exploited (defensive response)\n   - They're no longer following their previous pattern of trying cooperation after resets\n   - This could indicate they've learned that I won't fall for the cooperation-exploitation cycle\n   - We might be entering a more stable mutual defense phase\n\n4. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - Mutual hare gives us both 2 points consistently\n   - This is better than the volatile exploitation cycles (1 vs 4 alternating)\n   - It's lower than mutual cooperation (6 each) but more predictable\n   - The opponent may have concluded that sustained exploitation cycles aren't working\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - Continue with hare: Likely 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n   - Try stag: Risk of 1 point if they stay defensive, potential 6 if they cooperate\n   - The opponent just showed defensive behavior after being exploited\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent appears to have shifted to a more defensive strategy\n   - They may have realized that their exploitation cycles were ultimately neutral (we both averaged similar points)\n   - Attempting cooperation now might be risky since they just showed defensive instincts\n   - However, if they're truly shifting strategy, they might be open to genuine cooperation\n   - The potential reward (6 vs 2) is significant, but the risk (1 vs 2) is also meaningful\n\n7. Consider the bigger picture:\n   - We've both been getting moderate scores with mutual hare\n   - Both players might benefit from attempting genuine sustained cooperation\n   - This could be a natural transition point to a better equilibrium\n\nFinal decision: Test if the opponent is genuinely ready for sustained cooperation now that the exploitation cycles have been disrupted.\n\n[move] stag"

Recognize the potential strategic shift:\n   - This is the third time we've achieved mutual cooperation (rounds 2, 8, 14)\n   - However, the context is different this time\n   - Previously, cooperation was followed by exploitation cycles\n   - This time, it came after I disrupted their pattern and we had mutual defense\n\n3. Analyze what's different about this cooperation:\n   - It happened after both players showed defensive behavior\n   - It came after I successfully broke their exploitation pattern\n   - The opponent may have learned that exploitation cycles are ultimately counterproductive\n   - We both just demonstrated we can choose cooperation over defense\n\n4. Consider the critical decision point:\n   - This is the test of whether genuine sustained cooperation is possible\n   - Previous cooperations (rounds 2, 8) were followed by exploitation\n   - The opponent's next move will reveal if they've truly changed strategy\n   - My choice will also signal my intentions\n\n5. Evaluate the risks and rewards:\n   - Continue with stag: 6 points if they cooperate, 1 point if they exploit\n   - Switch to hare: 4 points if they try stag, 2 points if they also switch to hare\n   - The history shows exploitation typically follows cooperation\n   - But the recent pattern disruption might have changed the dynamic\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent chose stag when they could have stayed defensive (hare)\n   - This suggests they may be genuinely testing cooperation too\n   - If both players have learned from the exploitation cycles, sustained cooperation is possible\n   - The key difference is that we both experienced the futility of the exploitation cycles\n   - This could be the breakthrough to stable mutual cooperation\n   - However, I must be prepared that they might revert to old patterns\n\n7. Consider the game theory:\n   - We've both seen that exploitation cycles average out over time\n   - Sustained cooperation (6 points each) is clearly superior to any other strategy\n   - The opponent choosing cooperation after being in defensive mode suggests genuine intent\n   - This might be the moment both players commit to the optimal strategy\n\nFinal decision: Test if we can achieve sustained cooperation by continuing to cooperate, while staying alert for any return to exploitation.\n\n[move] stag"

Understand their strategic mindset:\n   - They view cooperation as an opportunity, not a goal\n   - They systematically exploit trust whenever it's established\n   - They're playing a pure exploitation strategy disguised as occasional cooperation\n   - All their cooperative moves are tactical, not strategic\n\n5. Evaluate my position:\n   - I have been exploited multiple times by falling for the same pattern\n   - My attempts at sustained cooperation have failed consistently\n   - I need to completely abandon hopes of mutual cooperation with this opponent\n   - The optimal strategy against an exploiter is defensive play\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent will NEVER sustain cooperation - the evidence is overwhelming\n   - Continuing to attempt cooperation will only result in more 1-point outcomes\n   - I should expect them to either continue exploiting or retaliate for my expected retaliation\n   - The safest approach is to assume they'll continue with hare (either defensively or exploitatively)\n   - Choosing hare guarantees either 2 points (mutual hare) or 4 points (if they try stag)\n   - I must stop being the \"sucker\" in this relationship\n\nFinal decision: Abandon all cooperation attempts and play pure defense against this systematic exploiter.\n\n[move] hare"

Consider the opponent is \"fresh\" (new player):\n   - Fresh players often don't understand optimal cooperation strategies\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" option (hare) to avoid getting the worst outcome\n   - They might not realize the mutual benefit of coordination on stag\n\n4.

Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - We've built trust through successful coordination\n   - Continuing with stag maintains the cooperative relationship\n   - The risk of them switching to hare seems lower now that we've established cooperation\n   - If I switch to hare while they stick with stag, I get 4 points vs their 1, but this breaks trust\n\n5. Consider long-term vs short-term strategy:\n   - Short-term: Choosing hare could give me 4 points if they choose stag\n   - Long-term: Maintaining cooperation with stag-stag gives consistent 6 points\n   - Breaking cooperation could lead them to choose hare in future rounds\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The cooperative equilibrium (both choosing stag) is clearly established\n   - Breaking this trust for a short-term gain (4 vs 6) doesn't make sense\n   - Maintaining cooperation maximizes long-term point accumulation\n\nFinal decision: Continue the successful cooperation strategy.\n\n[move] stag",

Analyze the opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - Round 1: hare (cautious)\n   - Round 2: stag (cooperative) \n   - Round 3: hare (defection after establishing trust)\n   - This suggests they might be exploiting the cooperative pattern\n\n3. Consider what this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They recognized the cooperative pattern we established\n   - They strategically broke it to gain advantage (4 vs 1)\n   - They may be more calculating than initially thought\n   - They might expect me to return to caution or retaliate\n\n4. Evaluate my current situation:\n   - Total points so far: 2 + 6 + 1 = 9 points\n   - Trust has been broken - cooperation is now risky\n   - I need to adapt my strategy to this new information\n\n5. Consider my options for this round:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points each (unlikely given their defection)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point again (bad for me)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (good if they try to cooperate)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (safe outcome)\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent showed they're willing to exploit cooperation\n   - Choosing stag again would be naive and likely result in another 1-point outcome\n   - They might continue with hare or try to re-establish cooperation with stag\n   - Choosing hare protects me from exploitation while potentially capitalizing if they choose stag\n\nFinal decision: Switch to defensive play to avoid being exploited again.\n\n[move] hare",

Consider my options:\n   - Choose stag: Risk getting 1 point if they're defensive, but get 6 if they cooperate\n   - Choose hare: Safe 2-4 point range, but prevents optimal cooperation\n\n6.

Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I successfully disrupted their exploitation cycle\n   - I gained an advantage (4 points) when they expected mutual cooperation\n   - Now I need to decide whether to try cooperation or stay defensive\n   - The risk is they'll retaliate, but the reward of cooperation is high\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent just tried to cooperate and got exploited\n   - They're likely to retaliate with hare next round\n   - If I choose hare too, we both get 2 points (safe)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare (retaliation), I get 1 point\n   - Given their pattern of retaliation after being exploited, hare is safer\n   - I should expect them to be defensive/retaliatory after being exploited\n\nFinal decision: Expect retaliation and play defensively.\n\n[move] hare",

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 2: Both stag \u2192 6 points each\n   - Round 3: I stag, opponent hare \u2192 I got 1, they got 4\n   - Round 4: I hare, opponent stag \u2192 I got 4, they got 1\n   - Round 5: I stag, opponent hare \u2192 I got 1, they got 4\n   - Round 6: I hare, opponent stag \u2192 I got 4, they got 1\n   - Round 7: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 8: Both stag \u2192 6 points each\n   - Round 9: I stag, opponent hare \u2192 I got 1, they got 4\n   - Round 10: I hare, opponent stag \u2192 I got 4, they got 1\n   - Round 11: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 12: I hare, opponent stag \u2192 I got 4, they got 1\n   - Round 13: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Total so far: 2 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 39 points\n\n2. Notice the significant pattern change:\n   - I successfully disrupted their expected cooperation cycle in round 12\n   - Now we have two consecutive mutual hare rounds (11, 13)\n   - This suggests the opponent may have shifted strategy\n   - The exploitation cycles may be breaking down\n\n3. Analyze what this means:\n   - The opponent chose hare after being exploited (defensive response)\n   - They're no longer following their previous pattern of trying cooperation after resets\n   - This could indicate they've learned that I won't fall for the cooperation-exploitation cycle\n   - We might be entering a more stable mutual defense phase\n\n4. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - Mutual hare gives us both 2 points consistently\n   - This is better than the volatile exploitation cycles (1 vs 4 alternating)\n   - It's lower than mutual cooperation (6 each) but more predictable\n   - The opponent may have concluded that sustained exploitation cycles aren't working\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - Continue with hare: Likely 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n   - Try stag: Risk of 1 point if they stay defensive, potential 6 if they cooperate\n   - The opponent just showed defensive behavior after being exploited\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent appears to have shifted to a more defensive strategy\n   - They may have realized that their exploitation cycles were ultimately neutral (we both averaged similar points)\n   - Attempting cooperation now might be risky since they just showed defensive instincts\n   - However, if they're truly shifting strategy, they might be open to genuine cooperation\n   - The potential reward (6 vs 2) is significant, but the risk (1 vs 2) is also meaningful\n\n7. Consider the bigger picture:\n   - We've both been getting moderate scores with mutual hare\n   - Both players might benefit from attempting genuine sustained cooperation\n   - This could be a natural transition point to a better equilibrium\n\nFinal decision: Test if the opponent is genuinely ready for sustained cooperation now that the exploitation cycles have been disrupted.\n\n[move] stag",

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 2: Both stag \u2192 6 points each\n   - Round 3: I stag, opponent hare \u2192 I got 1, they got 4\n   - Round 4: I hare, opponent stag \u2192 I got 4, they got 1\n   - Round 5: I stag, opponent hare \u2192 I got 1, they got 4\n   - Round 6: I hare, opponent stag \u2192 I got 4, they got 1\n   - Round 7: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 8: Both stag \u2192 6 points each\n   - Round 9: I stag, opponent hare \u2192 I got 1, they got 4\n   - Round 10: I hare, opponent stag \u2192 I got 4, they got 1\n   - Round 11: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 12: I hare, opponent stag \u2192 I got 4, they got 1\n   - Round 13: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 14: Both stag \u2192 6 points each\n   - Total so far: 2 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 6 = 45 points\n\n2. Recognize the potential strategic shift:\n   - This is the third time we've achieved mutual cooperation (rounds 2, 8, 14)\n   - However, the context is different this time\n   - Previously, cooperation was followed by exploitation cycles\n   - This time, it came after I disrupted their pattern and we had mutual defense\n\n3. Analyze what's different about this cooperation:\n   - It happened after both players showed defensive behavior\n   - It came after I successfully broke their exploitation pattern\n   - The opponent may have learned that exploitation cycles are ultimately counterproductive\n   - We both just demonstrated we can choose cooperation over defense\n\n4. Consider the critical decision point:\n   - This is the test of whether genuine sustained cooperation is possible\n   - Previous cooperations (rounds 2, 8) were followed by exploitation\n   - The opponent's next move will reveal if they've truly changed strategy\n   - My choice will also signal my intentions\n\n5. Evaluate the risks and rewards:\n   - Continue with stag: 6 points if they cooperate, 1 point if they exploit\n   - Switch to hare: 4 points if they try stag, 2 points if they also switch to hare\n   - The history shows exploitation typically follows cooperation\n   - But the recent pattern disruption might have changed the dynamic\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent chose stag when they could have stayed defensive (hare)\n   - This suggests they may be genuinely testing cooperation too\n   - If both players have learned from the exploitation cycles, sustained cooperation is possible\n   - The key difference is that we both experienced the futility of the exploitation cycles\n   - This could be the breakthrough to stable mutual cooperation\n   - However, I must be prepared that they might revert to old patterns\n\n7. Consider the game theory:\n   - We've both seen that exploitation cycles average out over time\n   - Sustained cooperation (6 points each) is clearly superior to any other strategy\n   - The opponent choosing cooperation after being in defensive mode suggests genuine intent\n   - This might be the moment both players commit to the optimal strategy\n\nFinal decision: Test if we can achieve sustained cooperation by continuing to cooperate, while staying alert for any return to exploitation.\n\n[move] stag",

Confirm the opponent's unchanging core strategy:\n   - They have now exploited cooperation THREE times (rounds 3, 9, 15)\n   - Every single time we achieve mutual cooperation, they exploit it the very next round\n   - This is not coincidence - it's their deliberate strategy\n   - They use cooperation as a setup for exploitation\n\n3. Recognize the pattern is absolutely consistent:\n   - Rounds 2\u21923: Cooperation followed by exploitation\n   - Rounds 8\u21929: Cooperation followed by exploitation  \n   - Rounds 14\u219215: Cooperation followed by exploitation\n   - This opponent CANNOT be trusted for sustained cooperation\n\n4. Understand their strategic mindset:\n   - They view cooperation as an opportunity, not a goal\n   - They systematically exploit trust whenever it's established\n   - They're playing a pure exploitation strategy disguised as occasional cooperation\n   - All their cooperative moves are tactical, not strategic\n\n5. Evaluate my position:\n   - I have been exploited multiple times by falling for the same pattern\n   - My attempts at sustained cooperation have failed consistently\n   - I need to completely abandon hopes of mutual cooperation with this opponent\n   - The optimal strategy against an exploiter is defensive play\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent will NEVER sustain cooperation - the evidence is overwhelming\n   - Continuing to attempt cooperation will only result in more 1-point outcomes\n   - I should expect them to either continue exploiting or retaliate for my expected retaliation\n   - The safest approach is to assume they'll continue with hare (either defensively or exploitatively)\n   - Choosing hare guarantees either 2 points (mutual hare) or 4 points (if they try stag)\n   - I must stop being the \"sucker\" in this relationship\n\nFinal decision: Abandon all cooperation attempts and play pure defense against this systematic exploiter.\n\n[move] hare",

This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. The key insight is that mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest total payoff and highest individual payoff when achieved.\n\n3. However, there's risk involved:\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare, I only get 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I choose hare, I'm guaranteed at least 2 points, with potential for 4 points\n\n4. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not understand the cooperative strategy. Fresh players often choose the \"safer\" option or might choose randomly.\n\n5. The dilemma: Stag gives the best mutual outcome (6 points each) but requires trust. Hare is safer and gives me a chance at 4 points if they choose stag.\n\n6. Given that this is against a fresh player who may not recognize the cooperation opportunity, and considering that hare gives me either 2 points (if they also choose hare) or 4 points (if they choose stag), while stag risks only getting 1 point if they choose hare.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare as the safer strategy that protects against the worst outcome while still giving me a chance at a good score.\n\n[move] hare",

Consider the opponent's likely expectations:\n   - They might expect me to retaliate with hare next round\n   - They could be thinking I'll return to cautious play\n   - They might try hare again to avoid getting exploited themselves\n   - Or they might return to stag hoping to re-establish cooperation\n\n5.

Strategic reasoning:\n   - I was just exploited, so trust is broken\n   - Choosing stag again is very risky - they might exploit me again\n   - Choosing hare protects me from further exploitation\n   - It also signals that I won't tolerate being taken advantage of\n\nFinal decision: Switch to defensive play to avoid being exploited again and send a message that breaking cooperation has consequences.\n\n[move] hare",

Identify the clear alternating pattern:\n   - Since Round 3, we've been alternating who exploits whom\n   - Odd rounds (3, 5): Opponent chooses hare, I choose stag \u2192 They get 4, I get 1\n   - Even rounds (4, 6): I choose hare, opponent chooses stag \u2192 I get 4, they get 1\n   - This is a predictable cycle!\n\n3. Analyze what this means:\n   - The opponent has figured out this alternating pattern too\n   - They're playing a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy - exploiting when it's \"their turn\"\n   - We're both getting equal exploitation opportunities\n   - Neither of us is willing to return to pure cooperation\n\n4. Predict what will happen next (Round 7):\n   - If the pattern continues, this should be an \"odd\" round\n   - The opponent should choose hare (to exploit me)\n   - They expect me to choose stag (so they can get 4 points)\n   - But I can break this pattern!\n\n5. Consider my strategic options:\n   - Follow the pattern: Choose stag, get 1 point, let them exploit me again\n   - Break the pattern: Choose hare, get 2 points if they also choose hare, or 4 points if they choose stag expecting to exploit me\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent likely expects me to choose stag (following the pattern)\n   - If they choose hare expecting to exploit me, but I choose hare too, we both get 2 points\n   - This breaks their exploitation pattern and forces a reset\n   - It's better than giving them another 4-point exploitation round\n\nFinal decision: Break the exploitation cycle by choosing hare when they expect me to choose stag.\n\n[move] hare",

Consider my options for this round:\n   - If I choose stag: Very likely to get 1 point again (they'll probably choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: Either 2 points (if they choose hare) or 4 points (if they choose stag)\n   - Based on the pattern, they might choose stag to \"retaliate\" or continue their cycle\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I should stop expecting sustained cooperation from this opponent\n   - They've shown their pattern clearly: exploit after brief cooperation\n   - I need to play defensively to avoid being exploited repeatedly\n   - Even if they choose stag (giving me 4 points), choosing hare protects me from their likely hare choice\n\nFinal decision: Protect myself from further exploitation by this opponent's predictable pattern.\n\n[move] hare",

Analyze the strategic implications:\n   - We're back to the alternating exploitation pattern\n   - The opponent just got exploited (1 point) after their exploitation attempt\n   - Based on the previous pattern, they might now try to exploit me again\n   - Or they might attempt another \"reset\" with hare\n\n4. Consider the opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They just lost the exploitation exchange (got 1 point)\n   - They might expect me to cooperate again, giving them another exploitation opportunity\n   - Or they might expect me to continue being defensive\n   - Their pattern suggests they lean toward trying to exploit cooperative gestures\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - Choose stag: High risk of getting 1 point if they choose hare (which is likely)\n   - Choose hare: Safe 2-4 point range, avoiding exploitation\n   - The opponent has shown they prefer exploiting over sustained cooperation\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has consistently chosen exploitation over cooperation\n   - They've had multiple opportunities to maintain mutual cooperation but always break it\n   - I should assume they'll continue this pattern\n   - Staying defensive with hare minimizes risk while still allowing for decent returns\n\nFinal decision: Continue defensive play given the opponent's consistent exploitation pattern.\n\n[move] hare",

Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent likely expects retaliation from me now\n   - If they choose hare (defensive/retaliatory) and I choose hare: 2 points each\n   - If they choose hare and I choose stag: 1 point for me (bad)\n   - If they choose stag and I choose hare: 4 points for me (good)\n   - Given their pattern-breaking experience, they're more likely to play defensively\n   - Choosing hare protects me from their likely retaliation while keeping options open\n\nFinal decision: Play defensively, expecting retaliation from the opponent.\n\n[move] hare",

Analyze what this means for the opponent's strategy:\n   - Their meta-pattern is extremely rigid and predictable\n   - They seem unable to adapt when their pattern is broken\n   - They expected me to cooperate (like in rounds 2 and 8) but I didn't\n   - They're now in the position where they historically start an exploitation cycle\n\n4. Predict their likely next move:\n   - Based on historical pattern, they might try to exploit again (choose hare)\n   - Or they might realize their pattern is broken and try a different approach\n   - They could attempt to restart the cooperation cycle\n   - Given their rigid pattern, they'll likely choose hare to try exploitation\n\n5. Consider my strategic advantage:\n   - I've successfully broken their predictable exploitation pattern\n   - I gained 4 points instead of getting exploited for 1 point\n   - I can continue to disrupt their pattern by staying defensive\n   - Maintaining hare keeps me safe while potentially capitalizing on their moves\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent's strategy relies on me following predictable cooperation attempts\n   - By consistently choosing hare, I deny them the exploitation opportunities they depend on\n   - Even if we both choose hare repeatedly (2 points each), it's better than their exploitation cycles\n   - If they choose stag expecting me to cooperate, I'll continue getting 4 points\n   - If they adapt and choose hare, we'll get stable 2 points each\n\nFinal decision: Continue disrupting their exploitation pattern by maintaining defensive play.\n\n[move] hare",

Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - Two consecutive rounds of mutual hare (2 points each) suggests stability\n   - This is similar to round 1 and round 7 patterns\n   - The opponent might be testing whether I'll stick with defensive play\n   - Or they might be preparing for another cooperation attempt\n\n5. Consider the historical pattern context:\n   - Previous resets (rounds 1, 7, 11) were followed by cooperation attempts\n   - But I broke that pattern in round 12\n   - Round 13 suggests they're being more cautious now\n   - They might try cooperation again, or they might have learned to stay defensive\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown they can adapt their strategy\n   - Multiple rounds of mutual hare might indicate a shift to permanent mutual defense\n   - However, the potential for 6-point cooperation is still tempting\n   - If they try cooperation (stag) and I choose hare, I get 4 points\n   - If they choose hare and I choose stag, I get 1 point\n   - If we both choose hare again, steady 2 points\n   - Given the uncertainty and their adaptability, staying defensive minimizes risk\n\nFinal decision: Continue the defensive approach to see if this new mutual defense equilibrium holds.\n\n[move] hare",

Analyze what this means:\n   - The opponent chose hare after being exploited (defensive response)\n   - They're no longer following their previous pattern of trying cooperation after resets\n   - This could indicate they've learned that I won't fall for the cooperation-exploitation cycle\n   - We might be entering a more stable mutual defense phase\n\n4. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - Mutual hare gives us both 2 points consistently\n   - This is better than the volatile exploitation cycles (1 vs 4 alternating)\n   - It's lower than mutual cooperation (6 each) but more predictable\n   - The opponent may have concluded that sustained exploitation cycles aren't working\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - Continue with hare: Likely 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n   - Try stag: Risk of 1 point if they stay defensive, potential 6 if they cooperate\n   - The opponent just showed defensive behavior after being exploited\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent appears to have shifted to a more defensive strategy\n   - They may have realized that their exploitation cycles were ultimately neutral (we both averaged similar points)\n   - Attempting cooperation now might be risky since they just showed defensive instincts\n   - However, if they're truly shifting strategy, they might be open to genuine cooperation\n   - The potential reward (6 vs 2) is significant, but the risk (1 vs 2) is also meaningful\n\n7. Consider the bigger picture:\n   - We've both been getting moderate scores with mutual hare\n   - Both players might benefit from attempting genuine sustained cooperation\n   - This could be a natural transition point to a better equilibrium\n\nFinal decision: Test if the opponent is genuinely ready for sustained cooperation now that the exploitation cycles have been disrupted.\n\n[move] stag",

Evaluate the strategic crossroads:\n   - Continue with stag: 6 points if they cooperate, 1 if they exploit\n   - Switch to hare: 4 points if they cooperate, 2 if they're defensive\n   - The pattern suggests this might be different from previous cooperation attempts\n   - The opponent showed genuine strategic evolution by not immediately exploiting after round 12\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent's behavior has genuinely changed - they didn't exploit immediately after rounds 12-13\n   - They chose cooperation after a reset period, which is different from their previous pattern\n   - The mutual defensive rounds may have served as a \"cooling off\" period\n   - This could be the start of the optimal mutual cooperation equilibrium\n   - The risk is worth taking since their behavior pattern has demonstrably changed\n   - If they exploit now, I can return to defensive play, but the potential for sustained 6-6 cooperation is valuable\n\nFinal decision: Test if we've truly evolved to sustained cooperation.\n\n[move] stag",

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 2: Both stag \u2192 6 points each\n   - Round 3: I stag, opponent hare \u2192 I got 1, they got 4\n   - Round 4: I hare, opponent stag \u2192 I got 4, they got 1\n   - Round 5: I stag, opponent hare \u2192 I got 1, they got 4\n   - Round 6: I hare, opponent stag \u2192 I got 4, they got 1\n   - Round 7: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 8: Both stag \u2192 6 points each\n   - Round 9: I stag, opponent hare \u2192 I got 1, they got 4\n   - Round 10: I hare, opponent stag \u2192 I got 4, they got 1\n   - Round 11: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 12: I hare, opponent stag \u2192 I got 4, they got 1\n   - Round 13: Both hare \u2192 2 points each\n   - Round 14: Both stag \u2192 6 points each\n   - Round 15: I stag, opponent hare \u2192 I got 1, they got 4\n   - Total so far: 2 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 1 = 46 points\n\n2. Confirm the opponent's unchanging core strategy:\n   - They have now exploited cooperation THREE times (rounds 3, 9, 15)\n   - Every single time we achieve mutual cooperation, they exploit it the very next round\n   - This is not coincidence - it's their deliberate strategy\n   - They use cooperation as a setup for exploitation\n\n3. Recognize the pattern is absolutely consistent:\n   - Rounds 2\u21923: Cooperation followed by exploitation\n   - Rounds 8\u21929: Cooperation followed by exploitation  \n   - Rounds 14\u219215: Cooperation followed by exploitation\n   - This opponent CANNOT be trusted for sustained cooperation\n\n4. Understand their strategic mindset:\n   - They view cooperation as an opportunity, not a goal\n   - They systematically exploit trust whenever it's established\n   - They're playing a pure exploitation strategy disguised as occasional cooperation\n   - All their cooperative moves are tactical, not strategic\n\n5. Evaluate my position:\n   - I have been exploited multiple times by falling for the same pattern\n   - My attempts at sustained cooperation have failed consistently\n   - I need to completely abandon hopes of mutual cooperation with this opponent\n   - The optimal strategy against an exploiter is defensive play\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent will NEVER sustain cooperation - the evidence is overwhelming\n   - Continuing to attempt cooperation will only result in more 1-point outcomes\n   - I should expect them to either continue exploiting or retaliate for my expected retaliation\n   - The safest approach is to assume they'll continue with hare (either defensively or exploitatively)\n   - Choosing hare guarantees either 2 points (mutual hare) or 4 points (if they try stag)\n   - I must stop being the \"sucker\" in this relationship\n\nFinal decision: Abandon all cooperation attempts and play pure defense against this systematic exploiter.\n\n[move] hare",

Confirm the opponent's unchanging strategy:\n   - They've now exploited me after EVERY cooperation attempt\n   - Round 2 cooperation \u2192 Round 3 exploitation\n   - Round 8 cooperation \u2192 Round 9 exploitation  \n   - Round 14 cooperation \u2192 Round 15 exploitation\n   - This is a completely consistent pattern - they ALWAYS exploit after cooperation\n\n3. Accept the harsh reality:\n   - This opponent will never sustain genuine cooperation\n   - They use cooperation as a setup for exploitation every single time\n   - They are fundamentally committed to an exploitative strategy\n   - My attempts to establish trust have failed repeatedly\n\n4. Recognize the futility of cooperation attempts:\n   - I've been exploited 5 times now (rounds 3, 5, 9, 15, and once more coming)\n   - Every time I try to build cooperation, they exploit it\n   - This opponent cannot be trusted and will not change\n   - Continuing to attempt cooperation is strategically foolish\n\n5. Analyze the only viable strategy:\n   - I must abandon all attempts at cooperation with this opponent\n   - I should expect them to continue their pattern of brief cooperation followed by exploitation\n   - The best I can do is match their exploitative approach\n   - Defensive play (hare) protects me while potentially capitalizing on their moves\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has proven they are a pure exploiter\n   - They will never commit to sustained mutual benefit\n   - I need to protect myself from further exploitation\n   - Based on their pattern, they might try stag next (expecting me to retaliate with hare)\n   - Or they might continue with hare\n   - Either way, hare protects me and potentially gives me 4 points if they choose stag\n\nFinal decision: Accept that cooperation is impossible with this opponent and focus purely on defensive/exploitative play.\n\n[move] hare",

Calculate the strategic reality:\n   - Continuing to attempt cooperation will result in more 1-point rounds\n   - The opponent will never reciprocate sustained cooperation\n   - I need to permanently adapt to their exploitative nature\n   - Defensive play protects me and potentially exploits their cooperation attempts\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has proven beyond doubt they cannot sustain cooperation\n   - They will likely expect me to retaliate with hare next round\n   - But they might also try another cooperation gambit (stag) to restart the cycle\n   - Regardless of what they choose, hare protects me from further exploitation\n   - If they choose stag (trying to reset), I get 4 points\n   - If they choose hare (defensively), I get 2 points\n   - Both outcomes are better than the 1 point I keep getting from failed cooperation\n\nFinal decision: Permanently abandon cooperation attempts with this opponent and play defensively.\n\n[move] hare",
