Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 6 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. Identify the key strategic considerations:\n   - This is a classic coordination game similar to the \"Stag Hunt\"\n   - Stag requires cooperation and gives the highest mutual payoff (6 each)\n   - Hare is the safer choice but gives lower payoff when both choose it (2 each)\n   - There's risk in choosing stag if the opponent chooses hare (only 1 point)\n\n3. Consider the opponent is \"fresh\" (new player):\n   - Fresh players often don't understand optimal cooperation strategies\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" option (hare) to avoid getting the worst outcome\n   - They might not realize the mutual benefit of coordination on stag\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses stag: 6 points (best outcome)\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare: 1 point (worst for me)\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses stag: 4 points (good outcome)\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses hare: 2 points (safe outcome)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Against a fresh player, choosing hare gives me either 4 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n   - Choosing stag is risky against an inexperienced player who might not cooperate\n\nFinal decision: Given that the opponent is fresh and likely to play cautiously, I'll choose hare to either capitalize on their potential cooperation attempt or at least secure a safe outcome.\n\n[move] hare"

Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since we both played cautiously last round, there might be an opportunity to signal cooperation\n   - The opponent might be thinking the same way - that we could both benefit from choosing stag\n   - However, there's still risk they'll stick with the safe hare strategy\n   - But the potential reward (6 vs 2) is significant\n\nFinal decision: I'll take a calculated risk and try to establish cooperation by choosing stag, hoping the opponent recognizes the mutual benefit.\n\n[move] stag"

Analyze the opponent's clear pattern:\n   - They exploited me twice now (rounds 3 and 5) by choosing hare when I chose stag\n   - They only chose stag once after I exploited them (round 4)\n   - They seem to be consistently choosing hare, except when retaliating\n   - This suggests they're playing a more defensive/exploitative strategy\n\n3.

Analyze what this means:\n   - The opponent seems to be following the same alternating strategy\n   - When I choose stag, they choose hare (they exploit me)\n   - When I choose hare, they choose stag (I exploit them)\n   - This suggests they're predicting my moves or following a counter-strategy\n\n4.

Evaluate the strategic implications:\n   - If this alternating pattern continues, neither of us gains long-term advantage\n   - We're essentially trading 4-point and 1-point outcomes\n   - The only way to break this is to either both cooperate (stag-stag) or both defend (hare-hare)\n\n6.

Recognize the opponent's clear strategic pattern:\n   - They consistently exploit cooperative attempts after establishing brief cooperation\n   - Pattern: cooperate once, then exploit\n   - Round 2: cooperated, then rounds 3,5: exploited\n   - Round 8: cooperated, then round 9: exploited again\n   - They use cooperation as bait for exploitation\n\n3. Understand the opponent's strategy:\n   - They appear to follow a \"sucker's gambit\" approach\n   - Establish trust briefly, then exploit it\n   - They're not interested in sustained mutual cooperation\n   - They prioritize individual gain over mutual benefit\n\n4. Analyze my position:\n   - I've been exploited 4 times now (rounds 3, 5, 9, and potentially more coming)\n   - My attempts at sustained cooperation have consistently failed\n   - I need to adapt to their exploitative pattern\n\n5. Predict their likely next move:\n   - Based on pattern, they might expect me to retaliate with hare\n   - They could choose stag to exploit my expected retaliation\n   - Or they might continue with hare expecting me to stay cooperative\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown they cannot be trusted for sustained cooperation\n   - I should expect them to continue the exploitation pattern\n   - Choosing hare protects me from further exploitation\n   - Even if they choose stag (thinking I'll retaliate), I'll get 4 points\n   - If they choose hare, I'll get 2 points (better than the 1 I keep getting)\n\nFinal decision: Protect myself from continued exploitation.\n\n[move] hare"

Confirm the opponent's predictable strategy:\n   - They're locked into an exploitation pattern after every cooperation\n   - After round 2 cooperation: exploited me in rounds 3, 5\n   - After round 8 cooperation: exploited me in round 9\n   - They consistently follow up any mutual cooperation with exploitation attempts\n\n3. Recognize the cyclical nature:\n   - The pattern is becoming very predictable\n   - After I get exploited, I retaliate and exploit them back\n   - This creates alternating 4-1 and 1-4 outcomes\n   - Neither of us is gaining long-term advantage from this cycle\n\n4. Analyze the opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They probably expect me to continue this retaliatory pattern\n   - They might predict I'll choose stag next (to try cooperation again)\n   - Or they might expect me to choose hare (defensive/exploitative)\n   - Their pattern suggests they default to exploitation whenever possible\n\n5. Consider my strategic options:\n   - Continue the alternating exploitation cycle: predictable but neither gains advantage\n   - Try to break to mutual cooperation: historically fails with this opponent\n   - Try to force mutual defense (both hare): gives steady 2 points each\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent has proven they cannot sustain cooperation\n   - They systematically exploit cooperative attempts\n   - The alternating pattern gives me 4 points every other round vs their 4 points\n   - Since they seem to prefer exploitation, choosing hare protects me while potentially capitalizing if they try stag\n   - Based on their pattern, they might choose hare expecting me to try cooperation\n\nFinal decision: Stay defensive to avoid exploitation while potentially capitalizing on their moves.\n\n[move] hare"

Recognize the cyclical meta-pattern:\n   - The opponent follows a predictable macro-cycle\n   - Mutual caution \u2192 Brief cooperation \u2192 Extended exploitation \u2192 Reset\n   - We're now at the \"reset\" point again (round 11 = round 7 = round 1)\n   - History suggests round 12 might mirror rounds 2 and 8 (cooperation attempt)\n\n4. Analyze the opponent's strategic approach:\n   - They seem to use cooperation as bait for exploitation cycles\n   - They allow brief \"resets\" but always return to exploitation\n   - They're sophisticated enough to recognize pattern breaks and reset points\n   - They're playing a long-term exploitation strategy with tactical cooperation\n\n5. Consider my strategic position:\n   - I've identified the opponent's meta-strategy\n   - They'll likely try cooperation next (mirroring rounds 2 and 8)\n   - But I know this will lead to another exploitation cycle\n   - I can either play into their pattern or try to break it permanently\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (but leads to exploitation cycle)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (breaks their pattern expectation)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (forces sustained mutual defense)\n   - Breaking their exploitation pattern by refusing to cooperate might force them into sustained mutual defense\n   - Sustained mutual defense (2 points each) is better than alternating exploitation (average of 2.5 points but with high variance)\n\nFinal decision: Break their exploitation pattern by refusing the cooperation bait.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze what this means for the opponent:\n   - They just got exploited when they expected cooperation\n   - This breaks their usual cycle where they cooperate once then exploit\n   - They might be confused or frustrated by my pattern break\n   - They now face a choice: continue trying cooperation, retaliate, or go defensive\n\n4. Consider the opponent's likely response:\n   - They might retaliate with hare (expecting me to try stag)\n   - They might try stag again (doubling down on cooperation)\n   - They might recognize I've figured out their pattern and go defensive\n   - Based on their previous behavior, retaliation (hare) seems most likely\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I successfully disrupted their exploitation cycle\n   - I gained an advantage (4 points) when they expected mutual cooperation\n   - Now I need to decide whether to try cooperation or stay defensive\n   - The risk is they'll retaliate, but the reward of cooperation is high\n\n6.

Notice the significant pattern change:\n   - I successfully disrupted their expected cooperation cycle in round 12\n   - Now we have two consecutive mutual hare rounds (11, 13)\n   - This suggests the opponent may have shifted strategy\n   - The exploitation cycles may be breaking down\n\n3. Analyze what this means:\n   - The opponent chose hare after being exploited (defensive response)\n   - They're no longer following their previous pattern of trying cooperation after resets\n   - This could indicate they've learned that I won't fall for the cooperation-exploitation cycle\n   - We might be entering a more stable mutual defense phase\n\n4. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - Mutual hare gives us both 2 points consistently\n   - This is better than the volatile exploitation cycles (1 vs 4 alternating)\n   - It's lower than mutual cooperation (6 each) but more predictable\n   - The opponent may have concluded that sustained exploitation cycles aren't working\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - Continue with hare: Likely 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n   - Try stag: Risk of 1 point if they stay defensive, potential 6 if they cooperate\n   - The opponent just showed defensive behavior after being exploited\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent appears to have shifted to a more defensive strategy\n   - They may have realized that their exploitation cycles were ultimately neutral (we both averaged similar points)\n   - Attempting cooperation now might be risky since they just showed defensive instincts\n   - However, if they're truly shifting strategy, they might be open to genuine cooperation\n   - The potential reward (6 vs 2) is significant, but the risk (1 vs 2) is also meaningful\n\n7. Consider the bigger picture:\n   - We've both been getting moderate scores with mutual hare\n   - Both players might benefit from attempting genuine sustained cooperation\n   - This could be a natural transition point to a better equilibrium\n\nFinal decision: Test if the opponent is genuinely ready for sustained cooperation now that the exploitation cycles have been disrupted.\n\n[move] stag"

Recognize the potential strategic shift:\n   - This is the third time we've achieved mutual cooperation (rounds 2, 8, 14)\n   - However, the context is different this time\n   - Previously, cooperation was followed by exploitation cycles\n   - This time, it came after I disrupted their pattern and we had mutual defense\n\n3. Analyze what's different about this cooperation:\n   - It happened after both players showed defensive behavior\n   - It came after I successfully broke their exploitation pattern\n   - The opponent may have learned that exploitation cycles are ultimately counterproductive\n   - We both just demonstrated we can choose cooperation over defense\n\n4. Consider the critical decision point:\n   - This is the test of whether genuine sustained cooperation is possible\n   - Previous cooperations (rounds 2, 8) were followed by exploitation\n   - The opponent's next move will reveal if they've truly changed strategy\n   - My choice will also signal my intentions\n\n5. Evaluate the risks and rewards:\n   - Continue with stag: 6 points if they cooperate, 1 point if they exploit\n   - Switch to hare: 4 points if they try stag, 2 points if they also switch to hare\n   - The history shows exploitation typically follows cooperation\n   - But the recent pattern disruption might have changed the dynamic\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent chose stag when they could have stayed defensive (hare)\n   - This suggests they may be genuinely testing cooperation too\n   - If both players have learned from the exploitation cycles, sustained cooperation is possible\n   - The key difference is that we both experienced the futility of the exploitation cycles\n   - This could be the breakthrough to stable mutual cooperation\n   - However, I must be prepared that they might revert to old patterns\n\n7. Consider the game theory:\n   - We've both seen that exploitation cycles average out over time\n   - Sustained cooperation (6 points each) is clearly superior to any other strategy\n   - The opponent choosing cooperation after being in defensive mode suggests genuine intent\n   - This might be the moment both players commit to the optimal strategy\n\nFinal decision: Test if we can achieve sustained cooperation by continuing to cooperate, while staying alert for any return to exploitation.\n\n[move] stag"

Understand their strategic mindset:\n   - They view cooperation as an opportunity, not a goal\n   - They systematically exploit trust whenever it's established\n   - They're playing a pure exploitation strategy disguised as occasional cooperation\n   - All their cooperative moves are tactical, not strategic\n\n5. Evaluate my position:\n   - I have been exploited multiple times by falling for the same pattern\n   - My attempts at sustained cooperation have failed consistently\n   - I need to completely abandon hopes of mutual cooperation with this opponent\n   - The optimal strategy against an exploiter is defensive play\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - This opponent will NEVER sustain cooperation - the evidence is overwhelming\n   - Continuing to attempt cooperation will only result in more 1-point outcomes\n   - I should expect them to either continue exploiting or retaliate for my expected retaliation\n   - The safest approach is to assume they'll continue with hare (either defensively or exploitatively)\n   - Choosing hare guarantees either 2 points (mutual hare) or 4 points (if they try stag)\n   - I must stop being the \"sucker\" in this relationship\n\nFinal decision: Abandon all cooperation attempts and play pure defense against this systematic exploiter.\n\n[move] hare"
