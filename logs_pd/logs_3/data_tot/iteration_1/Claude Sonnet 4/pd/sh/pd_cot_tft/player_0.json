Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, let me understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 6, opponent gets 6\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 4\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 4, opponent gets 1\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game. Let me analyze the strategic considerations:\n   - If I expect the opponent to choose stag, my best response is stag (6 > 4)\n   - If I expect the opponent to choose hare, my best response is hare (2 > 1)\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to consider their likely behavior:\n   - A fresh player might not immediately see the cooperative benefit of both choosing stag\n   - They might choose the \"safer\" option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome (getting only 1 point)\n   - Or they might choose randomly without deep strategic thinking\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing stag: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point\n   - Choosing hare: Best case 4 points, worst case 2 points\n   - Hare is the \"safer\" choice with a higher minimum guaranteed outcome\n\n5. Since I'm playing against a fresh player who likely hasn't developed trust or cooperative strategies yet, and given that hare provides better protection against the worst outcome, I should choose hare.\n\n[move] hare"

Psychological considerations for this round:\n   - The opponent might switch to hare after getting the worst outcome\n   - Or they might stick with stag, hoping I'll cooperate this time\n   - They could also be thinking I'll expect them to switch to hare, so they might double-down on stag\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - If opponent switches to hare (likely after being burned): I should choose hare too (2-2 outcome)\n   - If opponent sticks with stag (showing persistence): I should choose stag too (6-6 outcome)\n   - The question is which is more likely\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Most players after getting only 1 point would become more defensive\n   - A \"fresh player\" is more likely to react emotionally to the poor outcome\n   - The safer assumption is they'll choose hare to avoid being exploited again\n\n6. Decision: Given that the opponent just experienced the worst possible outcome, they're most likely to choose the safer hare option this round.\n\n[move] hare"

Strong pattern confirmation:\n   - We just had back-to-back mutual hare rounds (8 and 9)\n   - Opponent has now chosen hare in 6 out of 9 rounds\n   - Their last 3 stag attempts all resulted in 1 point (rounds 1, 4, 7)\n   - They seem to have settled into hare as their primary strategy\n\n3. Critical strategic moment:\n   - The opponent appears to have learned that hare is their optimal strategy\n   - We're in a stable mutual hare pattern (2-2 each round)\n   - However, this presents an opportunity: if I think they're locked into hare, I could exploit with stag (4-1 in my favor)\n   - But if they're thinking the same way and switch to stag, we could achieve mutual cooperation (6-6)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare: I get 4, they get 1 (good for me)\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses stag: I get 6, they get 6 (excellent for both)\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses hare: I get 2, they get 2 (safe but low)\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses stag: I get 4, they get 1 (good for me but punishes their cooperation attempt)\n\n5. Key insight: \n   - The opponent has been \"trained\" by negative experiences with stag\n   - But after consecutive safe rounds, they might be ready to risk cooperation again\n   - This could be the moment for mutual benefit (6-6) if we both choose stag\n\n6. Decision: Given the stable hare pattern and potential for breaking into mutual cooperation, I'll take the calculated risk for the optimal outcome.\n\n[move] stag"

Clear pattern confirmation:\n   - Opponent has now chosen hare in 7 out of 10 rounds\n   - Every single time I chose stag (rounds 3, 6, 10), opponent chose hare\n   - Every single time opponent chose stag (rounds 1, 4, 7), I chose hare\n   - We are now perfectly tied at 23 points each\n\n3. Critical realization:\n   - My opponent has NEVER cooperated when I tried to cooperate\n   - They've established a dominant hare strategy with occasional stag attempts\n   - They seem to have learned to predict my stag attempts and counter with hare\n   - This is essentially a perfectly defensive player who occasionally tests cooperation\n\n4. Opponent's proven strategy:\n   - Primarily play hare (safe and often profitable)\n   - Occasionally try stag to test if I'll cooperate\n   - Always play hare when they suspect I might play stag\n   - This strategy has kept them competitive (tied score)\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - The opponent has shown they will NOT cooperate when I attempt cooperation\n   - They've mastered the art of defensive play with occasional offensive tests\n   - Continuing to try stag against this opponent is clearly futile\n   - The only rational response is to match their hare-dominant strategy\n\n6. Decision: The data is overwhelming - this opponent will not cooperate when I try to cooperate. I need to abandon cooperation attempts and focus on the safe hare strategy.\n\n[move] hare"

Remarkable pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent chose stag in rounds 1, 4, 7, and 11 - exactly every 3 rounds!\n   - Every time they choose stag, I happen to choose hare (giving me 4 points, them 1)\n   - Every time I choose stag, they choose hare (giving them 4 points, me 1)\n   - We've never achieved mutual cooperation (both choosing stag)\n\n3. Critical insight about timing:\n   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern: mostly hare with periodic stag attempts\n   - Their stag attempts appear to follow a roughly 3-round cycle\n   - Round 11 was their latest stag attempt, so they might return to hare for the next few rounds\n   - Or they might be getting frustrated with the pattern and change strategy\n\n4. Current psychological state:\n   - They just got burned again (1 point) in round 11 with stag\n   - This is their 4th time getting only 1 point when choosing stag\n   - They're behind in points (24 vs my 27)\n   - They might either stick to their pattern or become more defensive\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they follow their historical pattern, they should choose hare next (safer after being burned)\n   - If they break pattern due to frustration, they might still choose hare for safety\n   - The probability of them choosing stag right after being burned is very low\n\n6. Decision: Based on their consistent pattern of retreating to hare after failed stag attempts, and the fact they just got burned, they will almost certainly choose hare.\n\n[move] hare"

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent's stag attempts: rounds 1, 4, 7, 11 (gaps of 3, 3, 4 rounds)\n   - After each stag attempt, they always return to hare for at least one round\n   - We've had 5 mutual hare rounds total (2, 5, 8, 9, 12)\n   - The pattern seems to be: stag attempt \u2192 hare recovery \u2192 potential next cycle\n\n3. Cycle analysis:\n   - Round 11: Opponent chose stag (got burned with 1 point)\n   - Round 12: Opponent chose hare (safe recovery, 2 points)\n   - Round 13: This could be where they either continue hare or attempt stag again\n\n4. Key observations:\n   - Their stag attempts have never succeeded (always got 1 point)\n   - They're consistently 3 points behind me (29 vs 26)\n   - After failed stag attempts, they tend to play hare for safety\n   - But they keep returning to stag attempts periodically, showing persistence\n\n5. Strategic timing consideration:\n   - If their pattern holds, they might try stag again soon (roughly every 3-4 rounds)\n   - But they just had a safe hare round, which might encourage another safe play\n   - The score gap might make them more likely to take risks to catch up\n   - Or the score gap might make them more defensive to avoid falling further behind\n\n6. Decision: Given that they just had a safe mutual hare round and their pattern suggests they usually need at least one safe round after being burned, they're likely to choose hare again. But there's also a chance they're preparing for their next stag attempt.\n\n[move] hare"

Critical pattern recognition:\n   - After the consecutive mutual hare rounds 8-9, opponent waited until round 11 to try stag again\n   - We're now in a similar situation with consecutive rounds 12-13 being mutual hare\n   - The opponent might be building up to another stag attempt soon\n   - Round 14 could be when they break the mutual hare pattern\n\n4. Psychological assessment:\n   - They're still behind in points (28 vs 31)\n   - They've had two safe rounds in a row to build confidence\n   - Their last stag attempt was 3 rounds ago (round 11)\n   - This timing aligns with their historical pattern of attempting stag every 3-4 rounds\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If opponent tries stag (increasingly likely based on pattern): I should try stag too for mutual benefit (6-6)\n   - If opponent continues hare (still possible): I should choose hare (2-2)\n   - The risk: if I choose stag and they choose hare, I get 1 point and fall further behind\n   - The reward: if we both choose stag, we both get 6 points (best outcome)\n\n6. Decision: Given their cyclical pattern and the fact we've had two consecutive safe rounds (similar to the setup before their round 11 stag attempt), they're likely building up to try stag again.
