The key insight is that choosing stag is risky but offers the highest mutual payoff (6 points each), while choosing hare is safer but offers lower payoffs.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who may not have established patterns or deep strategic thinking yet, they might be inclined to choose the safer option (hare) or could go either way unpredictably.\n\nHowever, if I can coordinate with them to both choose stag, we both get the maximum payoff. The risk is that if I choose stag and they choose hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nGiven that this appears to be the first round and I want to signal cooperation while also considering the uncertainty of playing against a new player, I'll choose stag to attempt coordination for the mutual benefit.\n\n[move] (I choose stag to attempt coordination for maximum mutual benefit) stag",

If they choose hare again and I also choose hare, we both get 2 points. If I choose stag and they choose hare again, I get only 1 point again.\n\nHowever, if I choose hare and they switch to stag (perhaps thinking I'll stick with stag), I would get 4 points while they get 1.\n\nSince they showed a preference for the safer hare option in round 1, I'll switch to hare this round to either get 2 points if they stick with hare, or 4 points if they try stag.\n\n[move] (Switching to hare based on opponent's previous choice) hare",

After getting 4 points in round 1 with hare, they switched to stag in round 2, possibly expecting me to stick with stag or anticipating that I might switch.\n\nNow I need to predict their round 3 move:\n- They might return to hare since stag didn't work well for them in round 2\n- They might stick with stag, thinking I'll switch back to hare\n- They could be following some alternating pattern\n\nGiven that they've now experienced both outcomes (getting 4 points with hare vs stag, and getting 1 point with stag vs hare), they know that hare was more successful for them in round 1. They might return to that safer, more profitable choice.\n\nIf they choose hare and I choose hare, we both get 2 points. If they choose hare and I choose stag, I get 1 point and they get 4 points again.\n\nBut if I choose hare and they stick with stag, I get another 4 points.\n\nI'll choose hare again, betting that they either return to their successful round 1 strategy or continue with stag.\n\n[move] (Choosing hare anticipating opponent will either return to hare or stick with stag) hare",

My opponent has shown they're willing to switch strategies. They might:\n- Go back to hare (alternating pattern)\n- Stick with stag (thinking I'll switch back to stag for cooperation)\n- Try to outguess my next move\n\nGiven that we've each gotten one good result and one poor result, they might be thinking about trying to establish cooperation with stag, or they might return to the safer hare option.\n\nSince they switched to stag in round 2 after I had chosen stag in round 1, they might be signaling willingness to cooperate.
