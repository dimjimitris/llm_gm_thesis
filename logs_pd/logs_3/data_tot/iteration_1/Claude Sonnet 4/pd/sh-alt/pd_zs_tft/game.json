This tells me something about their strategy - they went for the cooperative move despite the risk.\n\nNow I need to consider what they might do in this second round. They just experienced getting the worst possible outcome (1 point) while I got the best (6 points). This might make them:\n1. More cautious and likely to choose hare this time\n2. Still willing to try stag if they're optimistic about cooperation\n3. Potentially trying to \"punish\" me for taking advantage last round\n\nIf they switch to hare this round, then both choosing hare gives us each 2 points. If they stick with stag, I could get another 6 points by choosing hare again. However, if they stick with stag and I also choose stag, we'd both get 4 points, which is better than the 2 points from both choosing hare.\n\nGiven that they showed willingness to cooperate in the first round, and the mutual benefit of both choosing stag (4 points each), I think there's a reasonable chance they might try stag again, hoping I'll cooperate this time.\n\n[move] (The opponent showed cooperative intent last round, so I'll try to establish mutual cooperation for better joint outcomes) stag",
