They've had numerous opportunities to attempt cooperation but have shown zero deviation from hare since round 1. Every time I attempted cooperation (rounds 2 and 4), they maintained their hare choice and I was penalized.\n\nWhile we're both missing out on the superior mutual outcome of 4 points each from choosing stag together, the risk of unilateral cooperation continues to be too high given their established pattern. The safe 2-point mutual outcome remains the rational choice.\n\n[move] (Sticking with the well-established safe strategy) hare"

However, the risk analysis remains the same - they've shown incredible consistency and discipline in sticking to hare.\n\nGiven that every previous attempt at cooperation resulted in exploitation, and their pattern shows no signs of changing, the evidence still strongly supports continuing with hare for the guaranteed 2 points rather than risking 1 point.\n\n[move] (Continuing with the proven strategy given the opponent's unwavering consistency) hare"

The two times I chose stag (rounds 2 and 4), they stuck with hare and I got only 1 point while they got 6.\n\nThe rational choice based on their demonstrated behavior pattern still points to hare for the safe 2-point outcome.\n\n[move] (Maintaining the established safe approach given the opponent's remarkable consistency) hare"
