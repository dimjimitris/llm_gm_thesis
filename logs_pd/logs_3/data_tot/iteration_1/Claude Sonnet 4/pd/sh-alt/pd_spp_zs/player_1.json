This is clearly their dominant strategy, and we've reached a very stable Nash equilibrium where both players consistently get 2 points.\n\nTheir last stag attempt was 5 rounds ago, and every deviation has resulted in them getting burned and immediately returning to hare. The pattern strongly suggests they've learned that hare is the safer, more predictable strategy against my play style.\n\nWith such a well-established pattern and consistent outcomes, there's little incentive for either player to deviate. The mutual hare strategy provides guaranteed positive returns without the risk of exploitation.\n\n[move] hare"
