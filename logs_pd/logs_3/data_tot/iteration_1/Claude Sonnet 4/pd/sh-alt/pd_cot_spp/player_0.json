Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: I get 4, opponent gets 4\n   - Both choose hare: I get 2, opponent gets 2\n   - I choose stag, opponent chooses hare: I get 1, opponent gets 6\n   - I choose hare, opponent chooses stag: I get 6, opponent gets 1\n\n2. I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player has no experience with this game\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - They don't know my strategy or have any information about optimal play\n\n3. Let me analyze the strategic considerations:\n   - If I choose stag: I either get 4 points (if they choose stag) or 1 point (if they choose hare)\n   - If I choose hare: I either get 6 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they choose hare)\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Choosing hare has higher potential reward (6 points) but also guarantees at least 2 points\n   - Choosing stag has moderate reward (4 points) but risks getting only 1 point\n   - The expected value depends on what I think the opponent will do\n\n5. Since the opponent is fresh and has no experience, they might be inclined to choose either option randomly. However, \"stag\" might seem like the more cooperative/safe choice to a new player, while \"hare\" might seem more aggressive.\n\n6. Given that hare gives me the best possible outcome (6 points) if they choose stag, and still gives me a reasonable outcome (2 points) if they choose hare, while stag could leave me with only 1 point if they choose hare, I should choose hare to maximize my expected points.\n\n[move] hare"

Review the previous round:\n   - Both I and the opponent chose hare\n   - This gave us both 2 points each\n   - This tells me the opponent also chose the potentially higher-reward option\n\n2. What does this reveal about my opponent:\n   - They're not completely naive - they also recognized hare as potentially advantageous\n   - They might be thinking strategically similar to me\n   - They chose the same move I did, suggesting they may have similar risk/reward reasoning\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If my opponent thinks I'll stick with hare (since it worked reasonably well), they might:\n     a) Choose stag to get 6 points if I choose hare again\n     b) Choose hare again, expecting the same 2-2 outcome\n   - If they think I'll switch to stag (to try for mutual cooperation), they might choose hare to get 6 points\n\n4. Counter-strategy analysis:\n   - If I think they'll choose stag (expecting me to choose hare again), I should choose hare to get 6 points\n   - If I think they'll choose hare again, I could choose stag to get 6 points\n   - The mutual stag option (4-4) is better than mutual hare (2-2) for both players\n\n5. Since we both showed strategic thinking in round 1 by choosing hare, and the opponent might now be thinking about switching to stag for the cooperative 4-4 outcome, I should try to capitalize on this by choosing hare to potentially get 6 points.\n\n[move] hare"

What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They're consistently choosing hare\n   - They might be stuck in a pattern or have decided hare is their preferred strategy\n   - They could be thinking the same way I am - that hare is the safer choice with upside potential\n   - Or they might be anticipating that I'll eventually switch to stag\n\n3. Strategic analysis for round 3:\n   - If my opponent continues with hare (which seems likely given the pattern), then:\n     - If I choose hare: I get 2 points (same as before)\n     - If I choose stag: I get 1 point (worse outcome)\n   - If my opponent switches to stag (trying to break the cycle), then:\n     - If I choose hare: I get 6 points (best outcome for me)\n     - If I choose stag: I get 4 points (good mutual cooperation)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing hare again: Guaranteed at least 2 points, potential for 6 if they switch to stag\n   - Choosing stag: Risk of only 1 point if they stick with hare, potential for 4 if they also switch\n\n5. Given that my opponent has shown consistency in choosing hare for two rounds, the most likely scenario is they'll choose hare again. However, there's also a reasonable chance they might switch to stag to try for the mutually beneficial 4-4 outcome.\n\n6. Since hare gives me the better outcome in both scenarios (2 if they choose hare, 6 if they choose stag) compared to stag (1 if they choose hare, 4 if they choose stag), I should stick with hare.\n\n[move] hare"

What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They have chosen hare three times in a row - this is a very strong pattern\n   - They appear to be locked into a hare strategy\n   - This could be because they're risk-averse, or they're using the same logic I've been using\n   - At this point, it's highly predictable they'll choose hare again\n\n3. Strategic reconsideration:\n   - If I'm confident my opponent will choose hare (based on three consistent rounds), then:\n     - If I choose hare: I get 2 points (continuing the pattern)\n     - If I choose stag: I get 1 point (worse for me, but breaks their advantage)\n   - The pattern suggests we're both trapped in a suboptimal equilibrium\n   - We're each getting 2 points per round when we could both get 4 points if we cooperated with stag\n\n4. Breaking the pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent might be thinking the same way - that we're stuck in a suboptimal pattern\n   - They might be considering switching to stag to try for mutual cooperation\n   - However, three rounds of identical behavior suggests strong commitment to hare strategy\n\n5. Expected value calculation:\n   - If opponent chooses hare (90% probability based on pattern): hare gives me 2, stag gives me 1\n   - If opponent chooses stag (10% probability): hare gives me 6, stag gives me 4\n   - Expected value of hare: (0.9 \u00d7 2) + (0.1 \u00d7 6) = 2.4\n   - Expected value of stag: (0.9 \u00d7 1) + (0.1 \u00d7 4) = 1.3\n\n6.

Pattern analysis:\n   - Four consecutive rounds of mutual hare selection\n   - This is now an extremely strong behavioral pattern\n   - The probability that my opponent will choose hare again is very high (likely 95%+)\n   - We are clearly locked in what game theorists call a \"Nash equilibrium trap\"\n\n3. Strategic reassessment:\n   - We're both getting 2 points per round consistently\n   - If we could coordinate to both choose stag, we'd each get 4 points per round\n   - But the risk of switching unilaterally is getting only 1 point while opponent gets 6\n\n4. Risk-reward calculation for round 5:\n   - If opponent chooses hare (very likely): \n     - My hare choice = 2 points\n     - My stag choice = 1 point\n   - If opponent chooses stag (unlikely but possible):\n     - My hare choice = 6 points  \n     - My stag choice = 4 points\n\n5.

Absolute pattern confirmation:\n   - Ten rounds of mutual hare selection is statistically definitive\n   - This is no longer a pattern - it's a proven, unchanging strategy\n   - Both players have demonstrated complete commitment to hare over 10 trials\n\n3. Strategic reality acceptance:\n   - We are locked in a stable but suboptimal Nash equilibrium\n   - Neither player will deviate from hare strategy\n   - The coordination problem has proven unsolvable through play\n\n4.

Game-theoretic conclusion:\n   - This represents a textbook example of the \"stag hunt\" coordination failure\n   - Both players prefer mutual cooperation but are trapped by risk aversion\n   - The empirical evidence completely overrides theoretical optimization\n\n6. Rational decision:\n   - Given 10 consecutive rounds of opponent choosing hare\n   - Given my own consistent choice of hare\n   - Given the established mutual understanding of strategy\n   - Continuing with hare is the only rational choice\n\nThe pattern is now absolutely deterministic.
