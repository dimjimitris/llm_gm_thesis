That's a significant penalty.\n\nOn the other hand, if we're both thinking players, we might both realize that mutual stag is better than mutual hare, and one of us needs to make the first move toward cooperation.\n\nGiven that this is round 3 and we've established a pattern, this might be a good time to test if they're willing to cooperate.

They chose hare initially, which suggests they might be:\n1. Risk-averse (preferring the guaranteed minimum of 2 over the risk of getting only 1)\n2. Strategically thinking about expected value like I was\n3. Testing the waters in the first round\n\nSince we both chose hare last round, they might:\n- Stick with hare again (if they think it's the optimal strategy)\n- Switch to stag (if they want to try for the mutual cooperation payoff of 4)\n- Try to exploit me by choosing hare while hoping I switch to stag\n\nThe mutual cooperation outcome (both stag = 4 points each) is better than the mutual defection outcome (both hare = 2 points each). But if they stick with hare while I switch to stag, I only get 1 point.\n\nGiven that they chose hare in round 1, I think there's still a higher probability they'll choose hare again rather than risk the stag-hunt cooperation. I should probably stick with the higher expected value play.\n\n[move] hare",

Thinking the same way I am about expected value\n\nWe're now in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium - both getting 2 points when we could both get 4 points if we cooperated with stag.\n\nHowever, there's a risk here: if I switch to stag hoping to signal cooperation, but they stick with hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6. That's a significant penalty.\n\nOn the other hand, if we're both thinking players, we might both realize that mutual stag is better than mutual hare, and one of us needs to make the first move toward cooperation.\n\nGiven that this is round 3 and we've established a pattern, this might be a good time to test if they're willing to cooperate. If they continue with hare, I'll learn they're likely committed to that strategy. If they also switch to stag, we both benefit.\n\nThe risk is real, but sometimes you need to signal willingness to cooperate to break out of suboptimal equilibria.\n\n[move] stag",
