This player has demonstrated such complete strategic rigidity that they might as well be a computer programmed to always choose hare.\n\nThe single punishment they received in round 2 appears to have created such a profound psychological impact that they've completely abandoned any form of strategic thinking or experimentation. They've turned what should be a dynamic strategic game into a predictable routine.\n\nAt this point, expecting them to choose anything other than hare would be completely unreasonable given the overwhelming pattern of evidence.\n\n[move] (Fourteen rounds of evidence proves opponent operates with complete strategic inflexibility) hare"
