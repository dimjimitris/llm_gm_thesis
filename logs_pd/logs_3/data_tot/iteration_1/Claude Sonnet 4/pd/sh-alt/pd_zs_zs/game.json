If I could guarantee the opponent chooses stag, then stag would be optimal (4 > 2)\n2. If I think the opponent will choose hare, then hare is better for me (6 > 1)\n3. Since this is a \"fresh player\" with no history, I need to consider what they might do\n\nA fresh player might:\n- Choose the safe option (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n- Choose randomly\n- Try to cooperate (stag)\n\nGiven the uncertainty and that this appears to be our first interaction, I think the opponent is more likely to play it safe with hare rather than risk getting only 1 point.
