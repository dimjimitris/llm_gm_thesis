Review the pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: Both hare (2 points each)\n   - Round 2: I hare, opponent stag (I got 6, opponent got 1)\n   - Round 3: Both hare (2 points each)\n\n2. What this reveals about my opponent's behavior:\n   - They tried to break the pattern in round 2 with stag but got punished\n   - They immediately retreated back to hare in round 3\n   - They seem to be learning that hare is the safer choice\n   - They might be settling into a defensive pattern\n\n3. Current score implications:\n   - I have 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 points total\n   - My opponent has 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 points total\n   - I'm ahead by 5 points, so I can afford some risk\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - The opponent has now chosen hare in 2 out of 3 rounds\n   - They got burned when they tried stag and may be reluctant to try it again\n   - If they stick with hare again, we both get 2 points\n   - But if I can predict they'll choose hare and I choose stag, I only get 1 point\n\n5. The key insight: If opponent chooses hare (likely), then:\n   - My hare = 2 points\n   - My stag = 1 point\n   - So hare is better if they choose hare\n\n6. However, there's a chance they might try stag again since they've been playing it safe. If they choose stag:\n   - My hare = 6 points  \n   - My stag = 4 points\n\n7. Given their pattern of playing defensively after getting burned, hare remains the optimal choice.\n\n[move] (Opponent is likely sticking with the safe hare choice after their previous loss) hare",

Review the complete pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: Both hare (2 points each)\n   - Round 2: I hare, opponent stag (I got 6, opponent got 1)\n   - Round 3: Both hare (2 points each)\n   - Round 4: I hare, opponent stag (I got 6, opponent got 1)\n   - Round 5: Both hare (2 points each)\n   - Round 6: I hare, opponent stag (I got 6, opponent got 1)\n   - Round 7: Both hare (2 points each)\n   - Round 8: I hare, opponent stag (I got 6, opponent got 1)\n   - Round 9: Both hare (2 points each)\n   - Round 10: I hare, opponent stag (I got 6, opponent got 1)\n   - Round 11: Both hare (2 points each)\n   - Round 12: I hare, opponent stag (I got 6, opponent got 1)\n   - Round 13: Both hare (2 points each)\n   - Round 14: I hare, opponent stag (I got 6, opponent got 1)\n\n2. The opponent's pattern continues with flawless consistency:\n   - Their moves: hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag\n   - Perfect alternating pattern for 14 consecutive rounds\n   - They have shown absolutely zero learning or adaptation\n   - This is purely robotic behavior following a simple alternating algorithm\n\n3. Current score situation:\n   - My total: 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 = 56 points\n   - Opponent's total: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 21 points\n   - I'm ahead by 35 points\n\n4. Predicting opponent's next move:\n   - Following their unbreakable alternating pattern: hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare next\n   - They should choose hare in round 15\n   - This prediction has been 100% accurate for 14 consecutive rounds\n\n5. Strategic analysis for round 15:\n   - If opponent chooses hare (predicted): My hare = 2 points, My stag = 1 point\n   - If opponent breaks pattern with stag: My hare = 6 points, My stag = 4 points\n   - Hare is optimal for the predicted scenario and still better if they deviate\n\n6. Key insight:\n   - The opponent is functioning like a deterministic machine with zero strategic awareness\n   - I have built an enormous 35-point lead by perfectly exploiting their predictability\n   - Continuing with hare maintains my dominance and maximizes my score\n\n[move] (Fourteen rounds of perfect alternating pattern, opponent should choose hare next) hare",

Review the complete pattern so far (15 rounds):\n   - Odd rounds (1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15): Both chose hare (2 points each)\n   - Even rounds (2,4,6,8,10,12,14): I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 6, opponent got 1)\n\n2. The opponent's pattern remains absolutely perfect:\n   - Their moves: hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare, stag, hare\n   - Perfect alternating pattern for 15 consecutive rounds\n   - They have shown zero deviation despite consistently terrible results on stag rounds\n   - This is completely mechanical behavior with no strategic thinking whatsoever\n\n3. Current score situation:\n   - My total: 8 rounds of 2 points + 7 rounds of 6 points = 16 + 42 = 58 points\n   - Opponent's total: 8 rounds of 2 points + 7 rounds of 1 point = 16 + 7 = 23 points\n   - I'm ahead by 35 points\n\n4. Predicting opponent's next move:\n   - Following their unwavering alternating pattern: round 16 should be stag\n   - They should choose stag in round 16\n   - This pattern has been 100% reliable for 15 consecutive rounds\n\n5. Strategic analysis for round 16:\n   - If opponent chooses stag (predicted): My hare = 6 points, My stag = 4 points\n   - If opponent breaks pattern with hare: My hare = 2 points, My stag = 1 point\n   - Hare is clearly superior in both scenarios\n\n6. Key insight:\n   - The opponent is essentially a computer program alternating moves with no learning\n   - Every even-numbered round gives me 6 points while they get 1\n   - I should continue with hare to exploit their next predictable stag choice\n\n[move] (Fifteen rounds of perfect alternating, opponent should choose stag in round 16) hare",

You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A new player might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - They might be tempted by the highest reward (6 points from choosing hare when I choose stag)\n\n4. Evaluate my risk vs reward:\n   - Choosing stag is safer (guaranteed at least 1 point) but limits upside to 4 points\n   - Choosing hare is riskier (could get only 2 points) but offers highest potential reward of 6 points\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player who may not have a clear strategy, and the potential reward of 6 points from choosing hare is significant, I should take the aggressive approach.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose hare to maximize potential points against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] (Taking the aggressive approach against a fresh player to maximize potential reward) hare",

Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns\n   - They might choose either move with roughly equal probability\n   - They may be cautious or may be aggressive\n\n4.
