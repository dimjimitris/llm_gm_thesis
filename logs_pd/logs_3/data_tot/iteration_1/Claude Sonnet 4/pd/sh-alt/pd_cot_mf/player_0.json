Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Review the complete pattern:\n   - Rounds 1-9: Both chose hare every single time\n   - Nine consecutive rounds of identical behavior\n   - Total score so far: 18 points\n\n2. Analyze the unprecedented consistency:\n   - Nine identical choices represents an almost certain fixed strategy\n   - This level of predictability is beyond normal strategic play\n   - The opponent appears completely committed to hare regardless of circumstances\n\n3. Reconsider the payoff matrix carefully:\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses hare: I get 1 point, opponent gets 6 points\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses hare: I get 2 points, opponent gets 2 points\n   - If I choose hare and opponent chooses stag: I get 6 points, opponent gets 1 point\n   - If I choose stag and opponent chooses stag: I get 4 points, opponent gets 4 points\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic reality:\n   - With nine rounds of evidence, the opponent choosing hare again is virtually certain\n   - If they choose hare and I choose stag: I get the worst possible outcome (1 point)\n   - If they choose hare and I choose hare: I get a decent outcome (2 points)\n\n5. Consider the risk assessment:\n   - Probability opponent chooses hare: ~99% based on nine-round pattern\n   - Switching to stag would almost certainly result in my worst outcome\n   - The established pattern works in my favor by maintaining predictable returns\n\n6. Assess alternative reasoning:\n   - Some might think \"they've been so predictable, maybe they'll switch\"\n   - But nine rounds of consistency suggests this is their permanent strategy\n   - Breaking a nine-round winning streak (from their perspective) would be irrational\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - The evidence overwhelmingly supports they will choose hare again\n   - Maintaining hare gives me reliable points without risk\n   - Deviating would likely result in my worst possible outcome\n\n[move] (Nine consecutive hare selections provides virtually certain evidence my opponent will choose hare again, so I'll stick with hare for reliable 2 points) hare"
