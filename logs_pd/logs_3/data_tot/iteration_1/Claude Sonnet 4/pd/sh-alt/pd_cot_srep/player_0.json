Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, other gets 6 points\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, other gets 1 point\n\n2. This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" game where cooperation (both choosing stag) gives a good mutual outcome, but there's temptation to defect for a potentially higher payoff.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone inexperienced), I need to consider what they might do:\n   - They might not understand the cooperative strategy\n   - They might be tempted by the high payoff of 6 points from choosing hare\n   - They might play conservatively and choose the \"safer\" option\n\n4. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose stag: I get either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect)\n   - If I choose hare: I get either 6 points (if they choose stag) or 2 points (if they also choose hare)\n\n5. Given that this is a fresh player who may not understand the value of cooperation, and considering the potential for a 6-point payoff, the optimal strategy is to choose hare. This protects me from getting only 1 point if they defect, and gives me the chance for the maximum 6 points.\n\n[move] hare"

From the previous round, I learned that the other player also chose hare, which means:\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me (choosing the safer/greedy option)\n   - They may not trust me to cooperate\n   - They could be following a consistent strategy of choosing hare\n\n2. Now I need to decide my strategy for this second round:\n   - If they continue with hare: choosing stag gives me 1 point, choosing hare gives me 2 points\n   - If they switch to stag: choosing stag gives me 4 points, choosing hare gives me 6 points\n\n3. Since they chose hare in the first round, there are a few possibilities:\n   - They might stick with hare (risk-averse or greedy strategy)\n   - They might switch to stag, thinking I'll do the same for mutual benefit\n   - As a fresh player, they might not have a sophisticated strategy\n\n4. Considering the payoff structure:\n   - If I expect them to choose hare again, I should choose hare (2 points vs 1 point)\n   - If I expect them to choose stag, I should choose hare (6 points vs 4 points)\n   - Hare dominates in both scenarios against my expectations\n\n5. Given that this is only the second round and the other player showed they're willing to choose the non-cooperative option, the safest and potentially most profitable move is still hare.\n\n[move] hare"

This suggests the other player might be:\n   - Following a consistent hare strategy\n   - Risk-averse and avoiding the 1-point penalty\n   - Not trusting that I'll cooperate with stag\n   - Possibly not understanding the mutual benefit of both choosing stag\n\n3. If this pattern continues and they choose hare again:\n   - If I choose hare: I get 2 points (safe but low)\n   - If I choose stag: I get 1 point (poor outcome)\n\n4. However, I should consider if they might be thinking strategically:\n   - They might expect me to switch to stag eventually\n   - If they switch to stag while I choose hare, I get 6 points\n   - The mutual stag outcome (4 points each) is better than mutual hare (2 points each)\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - Given their consistent hare choices, they seem committed to this strategy\n   - Switching to stag would likely give me only 1 point\n   - Staying with hare guarantees at least 2 points and keeps open the possibility of 6 points if they switch\n\n6.

Given this very consistent pattern, I need to evaluate if it's worth trying to break the cycle:\n   - If they continue with hare (highly likely): stag gives me 1 point, hare gives me 2 points\n   - If they surprisingly switch to stag (very unlikely): stag gives me 4 points, hare gives me 6 points\n\n4.
