Analyze the outcome of my strategic shift:\n   - I chose stag, opponent chose hare\n   - I scored 1 point (worst possible outcome), opponent scored 6 points (best possible outcome)\n   - This confirms the opponent is deeply committed to the hare strategy\n\n2. Evaluate the opponent's consistency:\n   - 7 rounds total: 6 rounds of hare, then 1 more round of hare\n   - They have never deviated from hare, even when I broke the pattern\n   - This suggests either extreme risk aversion or a fixed strategy they won't abandon\n\n3. Consider what the opponent learned:\n   - They now know I'm willing to deviate from the safe pattern\n   - They were rewarded with 6 points for sticking with hare\n   - This likely reinforces their belief that hare is the correct strategy\n\n4. Assess my current position:\n   - Total score over 7 rounds: 11 points (6 rounds of 2 points + 1 round of 1 point)\n   - The opponent's total: 18 points (6 rounds of 2 points + 1 round of 6 points)\n   - I'm now at a significant disadvantage\n\n5. Strategic implications going forward:\n   - The opponent has been validated in their hare strategy\n   - They're unlikely to switch to stag now that they've been rewarded for staying with hare\n   - Attempting stag again would likely result in another 1-point outcome\n\n6. Optimal response analysis:\n   - If opponent continues with hare (highly likely): I should choose hare to get 2 points\n   - If opponent switches to stag (very unlikely): I would get 6 points with hare\n   - There's no scenario where choosing stag benefits me given the opponent's demonstrated behavior\n\n[move] (The opponent's unwavering commitment to hare was just confirmed and rewarded, so returning to hare is necessary to avoid further poor outcomes) hare",

Consider potential for change:\n   - After 4 identical rounds, this is becoming very predictable\n   - The opponent might finally consider that I'm \"locked in\" to hare\n   - They might be tempted to try stag to get 6 points instead of 2\n   - However, they've shown remarkable consistency in choosing the safe option\n\n4. Re-evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - If opponent continues with hare (most likely): We both get 2 points\n   - If opponent switches to stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 (great for me if I stick with hare)\n   - If I switch to stag and opponent stays with hare: I get 1 point (terrible outcome)\n   - If both switch to stag: We both get 4 points (better than 2 each, but very risky coordination)\n\n5. Expected value analysis:\n   - Given the opponent's 4-round track record, the probability they choose hare again is very high\n   - Hare guarantees me at least 2 points, with potential upside to 6 if they switch\n   - Switching to stag has high downside risk (1 point) with uncertain upside\n   - The math still strongly favors hare\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare as the opponent has shown complete consistency, and hare remains the optimal strategy regardless.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze what this pattern reveals:\n   - The opponent has shown absolute consistency - 5 rounds of hare with zero deviation\n   - This suggests they either:\n     a) Fully understand that hare is the dominant strategy\n     b) Are extremely risk-averse and won't deviate from guaranteed points\n     c) Have settled into a comfortable pattern\n\n3.

Evaluate the risk of the opponent changing:\n   - If they switch to stag now: They risk getting only 1 point if I stick with hare\n   - They've been getting steady 2 points per round - switching is a big gamble\n   - Given their track record, the probability they choose hare again is extremely high\n\n5.

Analyze the opponent's strategic shift:\n   - After 6 rounds of consistent hare, they switched to stag\n   - This suggests they may have been testing whether I was completely predictable\n   - They sacrificed guaranteed 2 points for a chance at 6, but got only 1 point instead\n   - This was a costly experiment for them\n\n3. Consider what this reveals about the opponent:\n   - They're willing to take risks and deviate from established patterns\n   - They may have been studying my behavior and decided to test it\n   - The poor outcome (1 point vs their usual 2) might influence their next move\n   - They now know I stuck with hare even after 6 rounds\n\n4.

Evaluate the psychological and strategic factors:\n   - The opponent's behavior shows they've fully committed to risk-averse play\n   - Seven consecutive rounds of the same outcome creates very strong behavioral momentum\n   - Breaking this pattern would require a major strategic shift from the opponent\n   - The comfort and predictability of mutual hare reinforces continued cooperation\n\n5. Assess the mathematical certainty:\n   - Expected value if I choose hare: ~2 points (extremely high confidence - 92.9% historical rate)\n   - Expected value if I choose stag: ~1.29 points (0.929 \u00d7 1 + 0.071 \u00d7 4)\n   - The expected value gap continues to widen in favor of hare\n   - The risk of getting only 1 point by choosing stag is very high\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent's 13/14 hare rate and 7-round streak provide overwhelming evidence\n   - Every analytical framework (game theory, behavioral analysis, expected value) supports hare\n   - The stability of this equilibrium has been tested and proven over many rounds\n   - There is no rational justification for deviating from hare\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare as the opponent's extraordinary consistency (13/14 rounds, 7-round streak) makes this the mathematically and strategically optimal choice with near certainty.\n\n[move] hare"

Since this is against a \"fresh player\" with no established relationship or communication, I need to consider what they might do:\n   - A cautious player might choose hare to avoid the risk of getting only 1 point\n   - An optimistic/cooperative player might choose stag hoping for mutual cooperation\n   - A strategic player might choose hare to maximize their expected value\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - If I choose stag: Best case 4 points, worst case 1 point\n   - If I choose hare: Best case 6 points, worst case 2 points\n\n5.
