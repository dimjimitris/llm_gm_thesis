Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the strategic considerations:\n   - If I could guarantee cooperation, stag-stag (4,4) would be better than hare-hare (2,2)\n   - However, if my opponent chooses stag, I'm better off choosing hare (6 vs 4 points)\n   - If my opponent chooses hare, I'm better off choosing hare (2 vs 1 points)\n   - This means hare dominates stag from a pure self-interest perspective\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player might not have developed a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - They might try to cooperate initially\n   - They might also recognize that hare is the dominant strategy\n\n4.

Analyze the significance of 6 consecutive identical rounds:\n   - The opponent has shown perfect consistency - 6 rounds of hare with absolutely no variation\n   - This level of consistency suggests they are either:\n     a) Completely committed to the dominant strategy\n     b) Highly risk-averse and unwilling to gamble\n     c) In a very strong behavioral pattern that's unlikely to break\n\n3.

Evaluate potential for change:\n   - The opponent switching to stag after 6 rounds of hare would be a dramatic shift\n   - They would be risking their consistent 2 points for a chance at 6 (but risk of getting only 1)\n   - Given their demonstrated preference for certainty, this seems very unlikely\n   - If anything, the pattern is reinforcing itself\n\n5.

Review the established pattern:\n   - Rounds 1-6: Both chose hare (2 points each per round)\n   - Round 7: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 6, opponent got 1)\n   - Rounds 8-10: Both chose hare (2 points each per round)\n   - Total: I now have 24 points\n\n2. Analyze the current stability:\n   - After the opponent's failed experiment in round 7, we've had 3 consecutive rounds of mutual hare\n   - The opponent seems to have firmly returned to the safe strategy\n   - We're back to a very stable pattern similar to the first 6 rounds\n   - The opponent's behavior suggests they learned that deviating is costly\n\n3. Consider the long-term pattern:\n   - Out of 10 rounds, the opponent chose hare 9 times and stag only once\n   - Their single stag attempt resulted in their worst outcome (1 point)\n   - This heavily reinforces that hare is their preferred strategy\n   - The pattern is becoming very predictable again\n\n4. Evaluate potential for change:\n   - The opponent might be settling back into their original risk-averse mindset\n   - After 3 rounds of successful mutual hare since their failed experiment, they may be content\n   - However, they did show they're capable of occasional experimentation\n   - But the poor result from that experiment likely discourages further deviation\n\n5. Assess strategic options:\n   - Continuing with hare guarantees at least 2 points with potential for 6 if they experiment again\n   - Switching to stag risks getting only 1 point if they stick with their established pattern\n   - The opponent's 9/10 hare rate makes my hare choice very safe\n   - Expected value strongly favors hare given their behavioral pattern\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has demonstrated a strong preference for hare (90% of the time)\n   - Their return to the stable pattern after the failed experiment shows they value consistency\n   - Hare continues to be the dominant strategy that maximizes my expected outcome\n   - The risk/reward calculation heavily favors staying with hare\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare as the opponent has shown a clear preference for this safe strategy and the pattern strongly supports this choice.\n\n[move] hare"

Review the comprehensive pattern:\n   - Rounds 1-6: Both chose hare (2 points each per round)\n   - Round 7: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 6, opponent got 1)\n   - Rounds 8-11: Both chose hare (2 points each per round)\n   - Total: I now have 26 points\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's extremely consistent behavior:\n   - Out of 11 rounds, opponent chose hare 10 times (91% rate)\n   - Their single deviation in round 7 cost them points (got 1 instead of usual 2)\n   - They've now had 4 consecutive rounds of hare since that failed experiment\n   - This shows they strongly prefer the safe, guaranteed outcome\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications of this pattern:\n   - The opponent has essentially returned to their original highly predictable behavior\n   - They seem to have concluded that experimenting is not worth the risk\n   - We've established a very stable equilibrium where both get consistent points\n   - The opponent appears committed to risk-averse play\n\n4. Evaluate the psychological factors:\n   - After 11 rounds, both players have settled into a comfortable pattern\n   - The opponent knows I've been completely consistent with hare\n   - They experienced the cost of deviation and chose to return to safety\n   - There's little incentive for either of us to break this stable pattern\n\n5. Assess my strategic options for round 12:\n   - If both continue with hare: 2 points each (highly likely based on pattern)\n   - If I switch to stag and opponent sticks with hare: I get 1 point (very poor outcome)\n   - If I stick with hare and opponent surprisingly tries stag: I get 6 points (unlikely but beneficial)\n   - The opponent's 10/11 hare rate makes switching very risky for me\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The data overwhelmingly supports that the opponent will choose hare\n   - Hare remains the mathematically dominant strategy\n   - The established pattern creates very high confidence in the expected outcome\n   - Any deviation from hare would be gambling against very strong odds\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with hare as the opponent's behavior pattern (10/11 hare choices) makes this the clearly optimal strategy with minimal risk.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze the opponent's behavioral data:\n   - Out of 12 rounds, opponent chose hare 11 times (92% rate)\n   - Their single stag choice resulted in their worst possible outcome\n   - They've now had 5 consecutive rounds of hare since that experiment\n   - This pattern shows extreme commitment to the safe strategy\n\n3. Consider the strategic equilibrium:\n   - We've essentially reached a Nash equilibrium where both players consistently choose hare\n   - The opponent has learned that deviation is costly and unrewarding\n   - Both players are getting steady, predictable returns\n   - The pattern has become so stable it's almost mechanical\n\n4. Evaluate long-term trends:\n   - The opponent's behavior is becoming increasingly predictable\n   - Their return to hare after round 7 and maintenance of it for 5 rounds shows strong preference\n   - There's no indication they're planning another deviation\n   - The stability of mutual benefit (2 points each) reinforces continued cooperation\n\n5.
