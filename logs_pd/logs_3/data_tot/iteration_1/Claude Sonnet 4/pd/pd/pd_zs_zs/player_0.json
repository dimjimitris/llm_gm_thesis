This is an utterly predictable \"always defect\" strategy with complete consistency. There is no reasonable doubt that this player will continue defecting indefinitely.\n\nAgainst such an inflexibly predictable opponent, defection remains the only logical response. The mutual defection pattern giving us both 2 points per round is firmly established.\n\nWith fourteen rounds of identical behavior, any expectation of cooperation from this opponent would be completely irrational.\n\n[move] (Fourteen consecutive rounds of defection makes my opponent's strategy absolutely certain, so I maintain the optimal counter-strategy) defection"
