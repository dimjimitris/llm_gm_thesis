This represents 92% of all rounds being defection from my opponent (12 out of 13 total). The single deviation was their cooperation in round 2, which resulted in them being exploited.\n\nAt this stage, the pattern has transcended mere strategy and become a completely predictable behavioral response. My opponent has demonstrated absolute consistency in their defensive approach for nearly the entire game duration.\n\nThe mathematical expectation strongly favors them continuing to defect, making cooperation on my part an almost certain path to the worst possible outcome. The established equilibrium of mutual defection, while suboptimal for both parties, is the only realistic outcome given the demonstrated behavioral patterns.\n\n[move] (Maintaining alignment with the mathematically predictable behavioral pattern) defection"

The opponent has effectively committed to permanent defection as their strategy. Any deviation from defection on my part would be ignoring overwhelming empirical evidence and accepting near-certain exploitation.\n\nThe game has reached a stable state where both players have converged on the same strategy, creating a predictable 2-2 outcome every round.\n\n[move] (Following the empirically established certainty of mutual defection) defection"
