Nine perfect defections suggest my opponent is either completely locked into this strategy or has made a firm commitment to never cooperate first. The predictability is so strong that it would be reasonable to assume they have adopted defection as their permanent strategy.\n\nThe risk-reward calculation remains brutal: cooperating against an opponent with a perfect defection record would likely result in the worst possible outcome for me (1 point vs their 6). Meanwhile, continuing with defection guarantees the familiar 2 points.\n\nWhile someone could argue that after nine rounds, the potential for breaking into mutual cooperation becomes more valuable, the evidence strongly suggests my opponent will not reciprocate any cooperative gesture.
