We've each earned 28 points when we could have earned 56 points through mutual cooperation.\n\nThe pattern is so entrenched that it seems almost algorithmic. Fourteen rounds without a single deviation suggests my opponent operates under an unshakeable strategic framework that categorically rejects cooperation. The behavioral evidence couldn't be more conclusive.\n\nAt this extreme level of consistency, even considering cooperation seems almost irrational. Someone who has defected fourteen times in a row, passing up numerous opportunities for mutual benefit, has demonstrated an absolute commitment to this approach. The probability of them suddenly switching strategies approaches zero.\n\nThe penalty for attempting cooperation remains catastrophic: if they maintain their perfect defection record, I get 1 point while they get 6. With fourteen consecutive defections as precedent, this outcome is virtually guaranteed.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming and unambiguous.\n\n[move] (Fourteen perfect defections establishes mathematical-level certainty of continued defection) defection"

This is now an extraordinary demonstration of behavioral consistency - my opponent has defected in every single round across fifteen opportunities without any deviation whatsoever. We've each earned 30 points when we could have earned 60 points through cooperation.\n\nThe pattern has transcended normal strategic analysis and entered the realm of near-certainty. Fifteen perfect defections represents such overwhelming evidence that predicting my opponent's next move seems almost trivial. They have demonstrated absolute, unwavering commitment to defection across every possible opportunity.\n\nAt this point, the behavioral data is so conclusive that considering cooperation would require ignoring an enormous body of evidence. Someone who has defected fifteen times in a row has clearly made a fundamental strategic commitment that shows no signs of changing.\n\nThe risk remains severe and the outcome predictable: if I cooperate against someone with a perfect fifteen-round defection record, I get 1 point while they get 6.
