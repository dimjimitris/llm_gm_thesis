Analyze the opponent's surprising move:\n   - After exploiting my cooperation in round 5, they switched to cooperation in round 6\n   - This could be a strategic attempt to break the cycle\n   - Or they might be testing whether I'll reciprocate after they showed cooperation\n   - This creates an interesting strategic moment\n\n3. Consider the opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They may have realized that mutual defection is suboptimal\n   - They might be signaling willingness to cooperate after \"punishing\" my earlier cooperation attempt\n   - Could be attempting to establish a tit-for-tat or reciprocal strategy\n   - They took a risk by cooperating after I returned to defection\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I defect again, I might get another 6 points but signal pure exploitation\n   - If I cooperate, I risk getting 1 point if they defect, but could establish mutual cooperation\n   - The opponent just demonstrated willingness to cooperate despite recent mutual defection\n   - This might be the opportunity to establish a mutually beneficial pattern\n\n5. Make the decision:\n   - The opponent took a risk by cooperating after I defected\n   - This could be their attempt to signal a move toward mutual cooperation\n   - Reciprocating cooperation might establish a better long-term outcome\n   - It's worth testing if they're genuine about cooperation this time\n\n[move] (Opponent signaled cooperation after mutual defection, testing reciprocal strategy) cooperation",
