Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I defected, opponent cooperated - I got 6 points\n   - Round 2: I defected, opponent defected - I got 2 points  \n   - Round 3: I defected, opponent defected - I got 2 points\n   - Round 4: I defected, opponent defected - I got 2 points\n   - Round 5: I cooperated, opponent defected - I got 1 point\n   - Round 6: I defected, opponent cooperated - I got 6 points\n   - Round 7: I cooperated, opponent defected - I got 1 point\n   - Round 8: I defected, opponent cooperated - I got 6 points\n   - Round 9: I defected, opponent defected - I got 2 points\n   - Total so far: 28 points\n\n2. Analyze the pattern disruption:\n   - The opponent broke their anti-coordination pattern in round 9\n   - Instead of cooperating when I defected, they also defected\n   - This suggests they may be adapting their strategy\n   - The perfect anti-coordination pattern lasted only 3 rounds (6, 7, 8)\n\n3. Consider possible reasons for the change:\n   - They may have realized that anti-coordination was giving me too many 6-point rounds\n   - They might be testing whether I'll switch to cooperation now\n   - Could be moving toward a more defensive mutual defection strategy\n   - Or this could be a temporary deviation before returning to anti-coordination\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they return to anti-coordination: defection gives me 6 points\n   - If they continue mutual defection: defection gives me 2 points\n   - If they switch to cooperation: defection gives me 6 points\n   - Cooperation risks only 1 point if they defect\n\n5. Make the decision:\n   - The opponent's strategy change is unclear after just one round\n   - Defection remains the safest choice regardless of their new approach\n   - It guarantees at least 2 points and potentially 6 points\n   - Given their history of exploiting cooperation, defection is still optimal\n\n[move] (Opponent broke anti-coordination pattern, defection remains safest strategy) defection"

Consider what this means strategically:\n   - The opponent may have learned that anti-coordination was too costly for them\n   - They're now playing defensively to avoid being exploited\n   - This creates the familiar mutual defection equilibrium (2-2 points)\n   - They seem to have stabilized on this approach\n\n4. Evaluate my options going forward:\n   - Continuing defection gives us both 2 points per round\n   - Cooperating risks getting 1 point if they maintain defection\n   - The opponent has shown they will exploit cooperation when given the chance\n   - There's little incentive for them to cooperate given their past behavior\n\n5. Make the decision:\n   - The opponent appears to have settled on defensive defection\n   - They've demonstrated multiple times they will exploit cooperation\n   - Mutual defection at 2-2 is suboptimal but safer than risking exploitation\n   - Defection remains the dominant strategy against this opponent\n\n[move] (Opponent has shifted to consistent defection, maintaining defensive strategy) defection"
