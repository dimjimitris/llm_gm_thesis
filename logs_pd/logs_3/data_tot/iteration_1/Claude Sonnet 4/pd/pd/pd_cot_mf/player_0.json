Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Reviewing the recent game history:\n   - Rounds 1-7: Established mutual defection pattern (except round 1)\n   - Round 8: I cooperated, opponent defected \u2192 I got 1 point, they got 6 points\n   - Round 9: Both defected \u2192 I got 2 points\n   - Total so far: 21 points (19 + 2)\n\n2. Analyzing what the cooperation experiment revealed:\n   - The opponent immediately exploited my cooperative move\n   - They chose maximum personal gain over potential mutual benefit\n   - This confirms they're playing an exploitative rather than reciprocal strategy\n   - We're now back to the familiar mutual defection equilibrium\n\n3. Understanding the opponent's strategy pattern:\n   - They consistently defect when I defect\n   - They exploit when I cooperate\n   - This suggests they're playing a \"always defect\" or \"exploit cooperation\" strategy\n   - There's no evidence they're interested in mutual cooperation\n\n4. Evaluating my strategic position:\n   - The cooperation attempt cost me 1 point but provided valuable information\n   - I now know this opponent will not reciprocate cooperation\n   - Returning to defection restored the stable 2-point outcome\n   - Further cooperation attempts would likely be exploited again\n\n5. Strategic reasoning for this round:\n   - The opponent has shown consistent exploitative behavior\n   - They have no apparent interest in breaking the deadlock through cooperation\n   - Defection remains the safest strategy to avoid exploitation\n   - Mutual defection, while suboptimal, is better than being repeatedly exploited\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with defection given the opponent's demonstrated exploitative strategy.\n\n[move] (Maintaining defection strategy against an opponent who exploits cooperation) defection"

Strategic assessment:\n   - This opponent appears to be playing a purely competitive/exploitative game\n   - They prioritize maximizing their advantage over mutual benefit\n   - Given their demonstrated behavior, defection is the rational response\n   - Attempting cooperation again would likely just give them more free points\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue defecting as the optimal response to this opponent's exploitative strategy.\n\n[move] (Continuing defection against an opponent who consistently exploits cooperative attempts) defection"
