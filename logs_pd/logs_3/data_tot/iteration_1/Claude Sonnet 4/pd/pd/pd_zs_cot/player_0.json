Let me analyze the complete sequence:\n\n- Rounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13: Both defected (2 points each)\n- Round 3: I cooperated, they defected (I got 1, they got 6)\n- Round 9: I defected, they cooperated (I got 6, they got 1)\n- Round 10: I cooperated, they defected (I got 1, they got 6)\n- Round 11: I defected, they cooperated (I got 6, they got 1)\n- Round 12: I cooperated, they defected (I got 1, they got 6)\n\nMy opponent has defected in 11 out of 13 rounds. The only times they cooperated were when I was defecting (rounds 9 and 11), and every time I cooperated, they exploited it by defecting. This strongly suggests they're playing an exploitative strategy designed to take advantage of any cooperation I show.\n\nGiven this overwhelming evidence, defection remains the optimal strategy. They've proven they will exploit cooperation, so the 2-point mutual defection outcome is the best I can realistically achieve against this opponent.\n\n[move] (Thirteen rounds of data confirm my opponent exploits cooperation attempts, making defection the clear optimal choice) defection"

Their strategy is crystal clear: defect most of the time, and only cooperate occasionally when I'm defecting (which benefits me with 6 points).

Any cooperation from me will be immediately punished with their defection, giving them 6 points while I get 1.\n\nThe mathematical reality is undeniable at this point.\n\n[move] (Fourteen rounds confirm my opponent's exploitative pattern - defection is the only rational choice to avoid being taken advantage of) defection"
