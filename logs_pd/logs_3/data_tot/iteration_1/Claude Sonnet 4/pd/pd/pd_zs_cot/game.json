Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown willingness to attempt cooperation even after gaining an advantage\n   - This could be a genuine signal that they want mutual cooperation\n   - However, they might now revert to defection after being exploited\n   - Given the back-and-forth exploitation, they might expect me to cooperate as a reciprocal gesture\n   - This could be an opportunity to establish mutual cooperation if I reciprocate their attempted signal\n\n[move] (The opponent attempted cooperation right after exploiting me, which might signal genuine interest in mutual cooperation, so I'll reciprocate to test if we can break the defection cycle) cooperation"

A fresh player might:\n1. Choose randomly\n2. Default to cooperation as it seems \"nicer\"\n3. Default to defection to try to maximize points\n\nIf I cooperate and they cooperate, we both get 4 points - a good mutual outcome.\nIf I defect and they cooperate, I get 6 points - the maximum possible.\nIf I defect and they defect, I get only 2 points.\nIf I cooperate and they defect, I get only 1 point - the worst outcome for me.\n\nGiven that this appears to be a single round with no mention of repeated play, and the opponent is fresh and unpredictable, defection offers me the best expected value. It protects me from the worst outcome of getting only 1 point and gives me a chance at the maximum reward of 6 points.\n\n[move] (I choose defection to maximize my expected points against an unpredictable fresh player) defection",
