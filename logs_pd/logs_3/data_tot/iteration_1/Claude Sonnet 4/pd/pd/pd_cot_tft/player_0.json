Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - A fresh player likely hasn't developed a specific strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their instinct\n   - Many people initially lean toward cooperation in social games\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 4 points (good outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 6 points (best outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (mediocre outcome)\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - Cooperation gives me either 4 points (if they cooperate) or 1 point (if they defect)\n   - Defection gives me either 6 points (if they cooperate) or 2 points (if they defect)\n   - Defection guarantees at least 2 points, while cooperation could give me only 1 point\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since this is against a fresh player who might be inclined to cooperate initially, defection could yield the maximum 6 points\n   - Even if they defect, I still get 2 points rather than risking the 1 point from cooperating against a defector\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I should defect to maximize my expected points, especially against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] Defection"

Analyze what happened in Round 1:\n   - I chose defection, opponent chose cooperation\n   - I got 6 points, opponent got 1 point\n   - This confirms the opponent was initially cooperative\n\n2. Consider the opponent's likely response:\n   - They just got exploited (1 point while I got 6)\n   - Fresh players often react emotionally to being \"betrayed\"\n   - They might switch to defection out of retaliation or learning\n   - Alternatively, they might stick with cooperation if they're very trusting\n\n3. Evaluate my options for Round 2:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 4 points (mutual benefit)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (they get revenge)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 6 points again (unlikely they'll cooperate twice)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (both defensive)\n\n4. Probability assessment:\n   - High chance they'll defect this round due to retaliation\n   - Low chance they'll cooperate again after being exploited\n   - If they defect and I cooperate, I get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - If they defect and I defect, we both get 2 points\n\n5. Risk management:\n   - Cooperating is very risky - likely to result in 1 point if they retaliate\n   - Defecting guarantees at least 2 points\n   - The chance of them cooperating again is low, so the 6-point opportunity is unlikely\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given that the opponent was just exploited and is likely to retaliate with defection, I should defect to avoid getting only 1 point.\n\n[move] Defection"

Consider the opponent's current mindset:\n   - They cooperated initially (trusting)\n   - They switched to defection after being exploited\n   - Now we're in a mutual defection pattern\n   - They might be stuck in defensive mode, or they might try to break the cycle\n\n3.

Evaluate the sustainability of current strategy:\n   - Continuing to defect guarantees 2 points but is inefficient\n   - Both players would benefit more from cooperation (4 vs 2 points)\n   - The opponent might be thinking the same thing\n   - Someone needs to \"break the ice\" to escape this suboptimal equilibrium\n\n4. Risk assessment for switching to cooperation:\n   - Best case: Opponent also switches to cooperation \u2192 4 points each (mutual benefit)\n   - Worst case: Opponent continues defecting \u2192 I get 1 point (significant loss)\n   - The opponent has been defecting for 2 rounds straight, showing they're cautious\n   - But they might be ready to try cooperation since mutual defection isn't great for either of us\n\n5.

Strategic assessment:\n   - The opponent's next move is 100% predictable (defection)\n   - My optimal response to their defection is also defection (2 > 1 points)\n   - There's no game theory complexity left - just basic math\n   - Any other choice would be irrational given the established pattern\n\n5. Final reasoning:\n   - With 8 consecutive defections from opponent, the pattern is absolute\n   - Defection guarantees 2 points, cooperation guarantees 1 point\n   - The choice is purely mathematical at this point\n   - Continue with the optimal strategy\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has defected 8 consecutive rounds. Their behavior is completely predictable. I should defect to guarantee 2 points rather than waste a point on futile cooperation.\n\n[move] Defection"
