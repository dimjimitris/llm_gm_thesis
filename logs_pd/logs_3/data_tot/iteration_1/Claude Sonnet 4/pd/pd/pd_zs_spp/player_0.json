This level of unwavering commitment has moved beyond pattern recognition into the realm of strategic certainty. They've had fourteen separate opportunities to explore cooperation, and they've chosen defection with flawless reliability every single time.\n\nWe're now operating in what appears to be a permanently stable equilibrium. Both players have clearly committed to the dominant strategy with no signs of deviation. The predictability is now so complete that the game has essentially become deterministic rather than strategic.\n\nGiven fourteen rounds of perfect evidence demonstrating their unwavering approach, there's no logical reason to expect any change in their behavior.\n\n[move] (Fourteen rounds of perfect consistency makes defection the only rational response) defection"
