Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider if the opponent's strategy might be evolving:\n   - They may have given up on trying to exploit me after I consistently returned to defection\n   - They might be content with the safe 2-point outcomes\n   - Or they could be waiting for me to let my guard down before attempting another exploitation\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - The exploitative phase seems to have ended\n   - We're in a stable equilibrium of mutual defection\n   - Any attempt at cooperation on my part has historically been punished\n   - The opponent has shown no genuine interest in mutual cooperation\n\n6. Consider the risk assessment:\n   - Defecting: Guaranteed 2 points, maintains stable situation\n   - Cooperating: Based on established pattern, very high risk of getting 1 point if opponent exploits again\n\n7. Think about the game theory:\n   - We're in the classic Nash equilibrium of the prisoner's dilemma\n   - Both players defecting, while suboptimal collectively, is individually rational given the opponent's established behavior\n   - Breaking from this pattern has only led to exploitation in the past\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has established themselves as untrustworthy and exploitative. We've reached a stable equilibrium of mutual defection. I should maintain this strategy to ensure consistent results and avoid further exploitation.\n\n[move] (Stable pattern of mutual defection established, opponent has proven untrustworthy, maintaining defensive strategy) defection"

Think about game theory principles:\n   - In repeated prisoner's dilemma against an uncooperative opponent, defection becomes the rational choice\n   - The opponent has trained me that cooperation leads to exploitation\n   - Mutual defection, while not optimal collectively, is the best individual response to their strategy\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has firmly established themselves as exploitative and untrustworthy.
