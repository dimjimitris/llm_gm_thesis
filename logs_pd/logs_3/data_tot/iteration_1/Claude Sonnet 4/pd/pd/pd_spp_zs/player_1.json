At this point, the game has reached complete stability. My opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to defection for seven straight rounds, with no indication they will change strategy.\n\nThe dynamics are now completely predictable - we're both locked into the Nash equilibrium of mutual defection. While we could theoretically both benefit from switching to mutual cooperation (4 points each instead of 2), the history of exploitation (particularly round 5) and the extended pattern of defection makes any deviation extremely risky.\n\nThe game has essentially become a routine where both players earn 2 points per round with complete certainty.\n\n[move] (Maintaining the seven-round pattern of mutual defection for predictable results) defection"

In round 5, when I tried to reciprocate their cooperation, they immediately exploited me. Their cooperation attempts seem to be strategic moves to test if I'll cooperate, rather than genuine attempts at establishing mutual cooperation.\n\nGiven the history, particularly how they exploited my cooperation in round 5, I should remain cautious and stick with defection.\n\n[move] (Staying with the proven safe strategy despite their surprise cooperation) defection"

A periodic strategy to break up the monotony\n3. Attempts to signal willingness for mutual cooperation\n4. Random deviations from their main defection strategy\n\nHowever, their track record shows they will exploit cooperation when I offer it (round 5), and they consistently return to defection after cooperating. This suggests their cooperation moves are tactical rather than genuine attempts at sustained mutual benefit.\n\nGiven this pattern, defection remains the safest choice.\n\n[move] (Continuing with defection given the opponent's pattern of occasional cooperation followed by exploitation or return to defection) defection"
