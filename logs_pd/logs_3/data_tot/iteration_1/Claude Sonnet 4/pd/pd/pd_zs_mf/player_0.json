My opponent has now compiled a 14-0 record of defection choices, creating what appears to be an unbreakable strategic commitment. The consistency has reached a level that suggests either algorithmic decision-making or an absolutely rigid strategic framework.\n\nThe cumulative opportunity cost has grown to 28 additional points that mutual cooperation could have generated. Yet the individual risk analysis remains definitively clear: fourteen identical behavioral outcomes represent overwhelming evidence that cooperation would result in the 1-point disadvantage while my opponent gains 6 points.\n\nFourteen rounds of perfect consistency creates a predictive model that approaches mathematical certainty. The pattern has moved beyond behavioral tendency into the realm of established law.\n\n[move] (Maintaining the strategy validated by fourteen rounds of unwavering consistency) defection"

The behavioral pattern has now reached a level of consistency that defies statistical probability - both players have chosen defection with absolute uniformity across fifteen rounds, creating what has become a mathematical certainty of 2 points each per round.\n\nThis represents an almost unprecedented level of equilibrium stability in game theory. My opponent has established a perfect 15-0 record of defection, demonstrating what can only be described as algorithmic consistency. The pattern has transcended strategic choice and become behavioral law.\n\nThe collective opportunity cost has reached 30 additional points that mutual cooperation could have provided across these fifteen rounds. However, the individual risk calculation has become absolutely clear: fifteen identical outcomes represent mathematical proof of my opponent's strategy.\n\nWith fifteen rounds of perfect consistency, attempting cooperation would not just be strategically unsound - it would contradict overwhelming empirical evidence that approaches scientific certainty. The predictive power of this behavioral pattern is now virtually absolute.\n\n[move] (Following the strategy supported by fifteen rounds of mathematical consistency) defection"
