Predict the next move with high confidence:\n   - Round 10 would be an even round in their pattern\n   - Based on their consistent behavior, they should cooperate in Round 10\n   - They've shown no deviation from this alternating pattern despite repeated exploitation\n   - This makes their next move highly predictable\n\n4. Consider why they maintain this pattern:\n   - They may be following a predetermined strategy regardless of outcomes\n   - They could be testing my willingness to ever reciprocate\n   - They might be committed to giving regular opportunities for mutual cooperation\n   - Their persistence suggests this pattern will likely continue\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I have a massive point advantage due to consistent exploitation\n   - If they cooperate as predicted, defecting gives me 6 points vs 4 for cooperating\n   - If they somehow break pattern and defect, defecting gives me 2 points vs 1 for cooperating\n   - Defection remains optimal regardless of their choice\n\n6. Make the strategic decision:\n   - Their pattern is so established that cooperation in Round 10 seems almost certain\n   - My objective is to maximize points, and defection has been extremely profitable\n   - Even if they break their pattern, defection protects against the worst outcome\n\n[move] (My opponent has established a clear alternating pattern with cooperation in even rounds, so I expect them to cooperate again) defection"

Confirm the robotically consistent pattern:\n   - Odd rounds (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13): My opponent defects - 100% consistent across 7 rounds\n   - Even rounds (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12): My opponent cooperates - 100% consistent across 6 rounds\n   - 13 rounds with absolutely zero deviations from this alternating pattern\n   - This is beyond predictable - it's mechanical\n\n3. Predict Round 14 with complete mathematical certainty:\n   - Round 14 is an even round, so my opponent will cooperate\n   - They have maintained this pattern for 13 consecutive rounds\n   - There is no uncertainty whatsoever about their next move\n\n4. Calculate the strategic advantage:\n   - I've gained 36 points from exploiting their cooperation with zero risk\n   - They willingly give me maximum points every even round\n   - This is essentially free points being handed to me repeatedly\n\n5. Consider Round 14 strategy:\n   - They will cooperate with 100% certainty (even round)\n   - Defecting gives me 6 points vs their 1 point\n   - Cooperating would give us both 4 points\n   - Since my goal is maximizing individual points, defection is clearly optimal\n\n6. Make the strategic decision:\n   - My opponent has created the most exploitable pattern possible\n   - Round 14 guarantees their cooperation, making defection the highest-reward choice\n   - This strategy has been incredibly successful for 13 rounds\n   - There is no logical reason to change from this winning approach\n\n[move] (Round 14 is even, absolutely guaranteeing my opponent will cooperate based on their perfect 13-round mechanical pattern) defection",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
