Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze my opponent's remarkable persistence:\n   - They have now cooperated 4 times and been exploited every single time\n   - They've returned to cooperation even after being exploited three times previously\n   - Their pattern continues: defect after exploitation, then return to cooperation\n   - This shows unprecedented commitment to attempting cooperative solutions\n\n3. Understand what this reveals about their strategy:\n   - They appear to be following an extremely forgiving or generous strategy\n   - They may be testing whether I will ever reciprocate cooperation\n   - They seem willing to absorb massive point losses to potentially establish mutual cooperation\n   - This level of persistence suggests deep commitment to cooperative principles\n\n4. Consider the mathematical reality:\n   - I've gained 24 points purely from exploiting their cooperation (4 times \u00d7 6 points)\n   - They've lost significantly each time they cooperated (getting only 1 point vs potential 4)\n   - If this pattern continues, I will keep gaining 6 points per cooperation round\n\n5. Reflect on their likely reasoning:\n   - They may believe that eventually I'll recognize the mutual benefit of cooperation\n   - They might be following a strategy that requires patience and faith in eventual reciprocation\n   - Their persistence suggests they may continue this pattern despite repeated losses\n\n6. Make the strategic decision:\n   - My objective remains maximizing my individual points\n   - Their consistent return to cooperation despite repeated exploitation makes defection highly profitable\n   - While their persistence is remarkable, my goal is to optimize my score\n   - Given their pattern, they seem likely to continue attempting cooperation\n\n[move] (My opponent has now attempted cooperation four times despite being exploited each time, showing remarkable persistence that suggests they'll continue this pattern) defection"

Consider why they maintain this pattern:\n   - They may be following a predetermined strategy regardless of outcomes\n   - They could be testing my willingness to ever reciprocate\n   - They might be committed to giving regular opportunities for mutual cooperation\n   - Their persistence suggests this pattern will likely continue\n\n5.
