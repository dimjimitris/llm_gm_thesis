Defection still provides the safest floor and highest ceiling, especially since I don't know if they'll shift strategies.\n\n[move] (The opponent proved strategic in round 1, so I'll maintain the safer defection strategy) defection"

Opponent's unwavering behavior:\n   - 13 out of 13 rounds: Defection every single time\n   - No strategic adaptation or variation whatsoever\n   - They immediately exploited my single cooperative gesture\n   - This represents the purest form of \"always defect\" strategy\n\n3. Strategic certainty:\n   - We are in permanent mutual defection equilibrium\n   - I am achieving maximum possible points against this opponent type\n   - Any deviation from defection would be economically irrational\n   - The opponent has proven incapable of cooperation under any circumstances\n\n4. Final assessment:\n   - Defection: Mathematically guaranteed 2 points\n   - Cooperation: Proven exploitation resulting in 1 point loss\n   - Thirteen rounds provides overwhelming statistical confidence\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   With thirteen rounds of identical behavior, this opponent has demonstrated they are a pure exploiter with zero interest in mutual benefit. The optimal strategy is to continue defecting to maintain steady point accumulation without any risk of exploitation.\n\n[move] (Thirteen rounds of pure defection confirms opponent is incapable of cooperation) defection",
