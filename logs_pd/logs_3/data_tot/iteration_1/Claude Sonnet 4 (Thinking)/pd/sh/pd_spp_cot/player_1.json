    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Stag vs Stag: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n   - Hare vs Hare: 2 points each (safe mutual outcome)  \n   - Stag vs Hare: 1 point for me, 4 for opponent (risky for me)\n   - Hare vs Stag: 4 points for me, 1 for opponent (good for me)\n\n2. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - Fresh player likely doesn't know optimal strategy yet\n   - May choose Hare as the \"safer\" option since worst case is 2 points vs 1 point for Stag\n   - Fresh players often avoid the riskier high-reward option initially\n\n3. Calculate expected value:\n   - If opponent chooses Hare (likely): I get 4 points with Hare, 1 point with Stag\n   - If opponent chooses Stag (less likely): I get 2 points with Hare, 6 points with Stag\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Against inexperienced player, Hare provides better protection against worst-case scenario\n   - Hare gives me advantage if opponent plays defensively\n\n[move] Hare"

Consider opponent's likely strategy for round 2:\n   - They might stick with hare since it \"worked\" and felt safe\n   - They might switch to stag, thinking I'll stick with hare (to get 4 points vs my 1)\n   - They might switch to stag hoping for mutual cooperation (6 points each)\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose hare and they stick with hare: 2 points each again\n   - If I choose stag and they stick with hare: I get 1 point, they get 4 (bad for me)\n   - If I choose stag and they also switch to stag: 6 points each (best mutual outcome)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since we both chose hare in round 1, there may be potential for establishing cooperation\n   - Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit\n   - The 6-6 outcome from mutual stag is much better than repeated 2-2 outcomes\n   - Worth taking the risk to try establishing this cooperation\n\n[move] Stag"

Consider opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They demonstrated cooperative behavior by also switching to stag\n   - They might continue with stag to maintain mutual benefit\n   - Or they might try to exploit by switching to hare, expecting me to stay with stag\n\n3. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Continue with stag: If they cooperate, 6 points each (excellent); if they defect, 1 point for me (bad)\n   - Switch to hare: If they stick with stag, 4 points for me (short-term gain but breaks cooperation); if they also switch, 2 points each\n\n4. Long-term vs short-term thinking:\n   - Maintaining cooperation with stag-stag gives consistent 6 points per round\n   - Breaking cooperation for a one-time 4-point gain likely leads to retaliation and lower future scores\n   - The opponent showed willingness to cooperate, so continuing cooperation is the rational choice\n\n[move] Stag"
