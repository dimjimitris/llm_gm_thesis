If that's the case, since I just played hare, they might expect me to play hare again and choose stag to exploit me.\n\nBut if I think about it differently - maybe they're trying to always choose the move that gives them the advantage when I'm trying to cooperate, and choose the move that denies me the advantage when I'm being defensive.\n\nGiven this pattern, if I choose hare again, they'll likely choose stag again and I'll get 4 points.
