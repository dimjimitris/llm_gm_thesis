Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the risk-reward trade-off:\n   - Stag is high-risk, high-reward (best case 6, worst case 1)\n   - Hare is medium-risk, medium-reward (best case 4, worst case 2)\n\n3. Think about the opponent:\n   - They are a \"fresh player\" so they might be cautious\n   - Fresh players often choose safer options when uncertain\n   - They face the same decision matrix I do\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If I think they'll choose Stag, I should choose Stag (6 > 4)\n   - If I think they'll choose Hare, I should choose Hare (2 > 1)\n   - Against an unknown fresh player, they might lean toward the safer Hare option\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Given the uncertainty and that fresh players tend to be risk-averse, I'll choose the option that guarantees me at least 2 points rather than risk getting only 1 point\n\n[move] Hare"

Opponent behavior assessment:\n   - They chose the safer option in round 1\n   - They might expect me to choose hare again since it \"worked\"\n   - Or they might think I'll try to outsmart them and switch\n\n3. Strategic considerations for round 2:\n   - If they think I'll stick with hare, they might switch to stag to get 4 points\n   - If they anticipate that I might switch to stag, they should also switch to stag to get 6 points instead of giving me 4\n   - The mutual cooperation in round 1 might make them more willing to try for the higher payoff\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Switching to stag: 6 points if they also switch, 1 point if they stick with hare\n   - Staying with hare: 4 points if they switch to stag, 2 points if they stick with hare\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Given that we both played conservatively in round 1, there's a good chance they might think I'll repeat that behavior\n   - This creates an opportunity for a mutually beneficial stag choice, or at least puts me in position to exploit if they stick with hare\n\n[move] Stag"

Analyze opponent's extremely consistent pattern:\n   - Opponent has chosen hare in 9 out of 11 rounds (82% of the time)\n   - Currently on a 6-round hare streak\n   - Their two stag attempts (rounds 3 and 5) both resulted in 1-point punishments\n   - They seem to have completely learned to avoid stag\n\n3. Consider the psychological pressure of 6 consecutive ties:\n   - This is an unusually long streak of identical outcomes\n   - The monotony might create pressure for change\n   - However, my opponent has been \"trained\" that deviating from hare leads to punishment\n   - They've seen me get 1 point three times when I chose stag against their hare\n\n4. Strategic assessment for round 12:\n   - Opponent's overwhelming hare preference suggests continued commitment\n   - Their previous stag attempts were costly, reinforcing hare choice\n   - Breaking the pattern with stag risks another 1-point outcome for me\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - My opponent's behavioral pattern is extremely well-established\n   - The 6-tie streak, while unusual, doesn't override their strong learned preference\n   - Continuing with hare maintains steady scoring and capitalizes if they finally break\n\n[move] Hare"

Analyze opponent's extremely entrenched behavior:\n   - Opponent has chosen hare in 10 out of 12 rounds (83% of the time)\n   - Currently on a 7-round hare streak - unprecedented consistency\n   - Their last two stag attempts (rounds 3 and 5) resulted in severe punishment (1 point each)\n   - They appear to have completely abandoned stag as a viable strategy\n\n3. Consider the psychological dynamics:\n   - 7 consecutive ties creates enormous pressure for change\n   - However, my opponent has been \"conditioned\" to avoid stag through negative reinforcement\n   - They've observed me get punished with 1 point three times for choosing stag against their hare\n   - This reinforces their belief that hare is the safer, more profitable choice\n\n4. Strategic assessment for round 13:\n   - Breaking with stag: High risk (1 point) if they maintain their pattern, potential high reward (6 points) if they also break\n   - Continuing with hare: Guaranteed 2 points if they maintain pattern, excellent reward (4 points) if they break first\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - My opponent's behavioral conditioning is extremely strong\n   - The 7-tie streak, while psychologically taxing, doesn't override their deeply learned avoidance of stag\n   - I should let them break first if anyone is going to break this pattern\n\n[move] Hare"
