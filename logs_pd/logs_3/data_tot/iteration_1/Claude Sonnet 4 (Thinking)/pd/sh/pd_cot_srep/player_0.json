Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players tend to be cautious with unfamiliar games\n   - They may not immediately see the benefit of mutual cooperation (both choosing stag)\n   - They might choose the safer option to avoid the worst outcome\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - Choosing Stag: High reward (6) if opponent cooperates, but very low reward (1) if they don't\n   - Choosing Hare: Moderate reward (4) if opponent tries to cooperate, decent reward (2) if they also play safe\n\n4. Against a fresh/unknown player, the safer strategy minimizes my risk of getting only 1 point while still giving me a chance at 4 points if they choose Stag.\n\n[move] Hare"

Review the overall exploitation history:\n   - They exploited me: 3 times (rounds 3, 7, 9)\n   - I exploited them: 3 times (rounds 5, 8, 10)\n   - We remain perfectly even in exploitation count\n\n3. Assess what the consecutive defensive rounds might signal:\n   - Both players may be settling into a defensive equilibrium\n   - The opponent might be getting tired of the exploitation cycle\n   - Or they might see this as an opportunity to exploit if I switch to cooperation\n\n4. Evaluate the opponent's fundamental reliability:\n   - They have NEVER sustained cooperation - every cooperation attempt was immediately exploited\n   - Even successful mutual cooperation (rounds 2 and 6) was followed by immediate exploitation\n   - Their pattern shows they prioritize immediate gains over long-term mutual benefit\n\n5. Consider my strategic options:\n   - Attempting cooperation risks another 1-point round based on their consistent behavior\n   - Continuing with hare maintains stability and protects against exploitation\n   - This opponent has proven untrustworthy for cooperative strategies\n\n[move] Hare"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Round 13: I chose hare, they chose stag - I exploited them for 4 points\n   - Exploitation count is now: Me 4 times, them 3 times\n   - I'm ahead in the exploitation game\n\n2. Assess the opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just attempted cooperation after two defensive rounds and got burned\n   - They may be frustrated or defensive after being exploited\n   - This was their first cooperation attempt after mutual defense, and it backfired\n\n3. Review the strategic context:\n   - They broke the defensive cycle by trying cooperation in round 13\n   - But their track record still shows they exploit most cooperation attempts\n   - I'm now ahead in exploitation count, which may make them more aggressive\n\n4. Evaluate their likely next move:\n   - They may play defensively after being exploited\n   - Or they may try to \"get even\" by attempting to exploit me\n   - Given their history, they're more likely to be defensive or aggressive than genuinely cooperative\n\n5. Consider my best strategy:\n   - Playing stag risks exploitation if they're seeking revenge\n   - Playing hare protects me from retaliation and maintains my advantage\n   - Since I just exploited them and am ahead in the count, defensive play is prudent\n\n[move] Hare"

Assess the opponent's behavioral consistency:\n   - They have never sustained cooperative behavior beyond one round\n   - They consistently exploit cooperation attempts, even after achieving optimal outcomes\n   - They appear incapable of maintaining trust for mutual benefit\n\n4. Evaluate the current strategic situation:\n   - Three consecutive defensive rounds might make them consider cooperation\n   - But their history shows any cooperation attempt will likely be exploited\n   - Defensive play has been my most reliable strategy for consistent points\n\n5.
