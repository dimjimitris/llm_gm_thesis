Identify the risk: If I choose stag but the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4. This is the worst outcome for me.\n\n3.

Risk analysis:\n   - Choosing stag: Best case 6, worst case 1\n   - Choosing hare: Best case 4, worst case 2\n\nSince this is a fresh player with no established pattern, and the hint suggests this is the first interaction, I think they're more likely to play it safe with hare rather than risk the coordination on stag.

Analyze the established pattern: My consistent hare strategy over the last 6 rounds has yielded excellent results - alternating between 4-point advantages and safe 2-point outcomes, never falling below 2 points.\n\n2. Evaluate the opponent's response: They continue alternating between stag attempts (giving me 4 points) and defensive hare plays (mutual 2 points), showing they haven't found an effective counter to my strategy.\n\n3. Consider the strategic superiority: Since switching to primarily hare, I've scored 2-4 points every round while completely eliminating the devastating 1-point exploitations that occurred with cooperation attempts.\n\n4. Assess deviation risks: Any switch to stag remains extremely dangerous given this opponent's proven exploitation history (3 out of 4 cooperative attempts were punished).\n\n5. Apply proven success formula: The hare strategy has become my dominant approach because it consistently delivers good results while providing complete protection against this opponent's exploitative tendencies.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Maintain the highly effective hare strategy that has consistently outperformed all other approaches against this opponent.\n\n[move] hare",

Sometimes trying stag hoping I'll switch strategies\n2. Sometimes playing hare defensively when they expect me to continue with hare\n\nMy hare strategy has been incredibly successful - I've avoided all exploitation while getting either 2 or 4 points per round. This is much better than the devastating 1-point results when I tried cooperation.\n\nGiven this opponent's history of exploiting cooperation attempts (3 out of 4 times), there's no reason to deviate from the successful hare strategy. It's providing consistent, good results while protecting me completely from exploitation.",
