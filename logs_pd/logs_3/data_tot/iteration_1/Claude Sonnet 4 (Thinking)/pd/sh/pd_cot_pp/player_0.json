Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the successful pattern: I've now achieved three 4-point advantages (rounds 10, 12, 14) by playing hare when opponent played stag, interspersed with safe 2-point mutual hare outcomes.\n\n2. Evaluate opponent's persistence: Despite getting only 1 point when they play stag against my hare, they keep occasionally trying it, perhaps hoping I'll change strategies.\n\n3. Consider the strategic advantage: My consistent hare strategy has been highly profitable, averaging 3+ points per round in recent play while completely avoiding the 1-point exploitations that devastated me earlier.\n\n4. Assess the risk landscape: Any attempt at cooperation (stag) remains extremely dangerous, as this opponent has exploited 3 out of 4 previous cooperative attempts.\n\n5. Apply winning strategy: The hare approach has proven superior against this opponent - it provides excellent defense while capitalizing on their occasional stag attempts.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue the highly successful hare strategy, which has consistently delivered strong results while protecting against this opponent's exploitative tendencies.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyze the emerging alternating pattern:\n   - Recent rounds show opponent alternating between stag and hare against my consistent hare\n   - When they play stag: I get 4 points (rounds 10, 12, 14)\n   - When they play hare: We both get 2 points (rounds 11, 13, 15)\n\n2. Evaluate my strategic success: I'm averaging approximately 3 points per round with consistent hare play, while completely avoiding the 1-point exploitations that occurred with stag attempts.\n\n3. Consider opponent's testing behavior: They seem to be experimenting with different responses to my hare strategy, but none have been particularly effective against it.\n\n4. Assess the stability: Even the \"worst case\" of mutual hare (2 points) is still better than the catastrophic 1-point results from attempted cooperation.\n\n5. Apply proven winning approach: Hare has delivered consistent success while providing complete protection against this opponent's exploitative nature.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the highly effective hare strategy that has transformed my performance from exploitation victim to consistent point accumulator.\n\n[move] hare"
