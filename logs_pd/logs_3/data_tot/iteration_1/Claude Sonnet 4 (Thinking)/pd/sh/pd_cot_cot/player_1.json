Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: This is a coordination game where mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the highest joint payoff of 6 points each.\n\n2. Consider the risk-reward tradeoffs:\n   - Stag: High reward (6) if other cooperates, but low reward (1) if other defects\n   - Hare: Safer option with guaranteed minimum of 2, but caps upside at 4\n\n3. Evaluate the opponent: The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player\" - suggesting they may be more inclined toward cooperative play initially, rather than immediately adopting defensive strategies.\n\n4. Strategic reasoning: Since fresh players often haven't developed cynical defensive strategies yet, they may be more willing to attempt the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n5. Decision: The potential upside of mutual cooperation (6 points) significantly outweighs the downside risk, especially given the hint about playing against a fresh player.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag, banking on the fresh player being willing to cooperate for the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] stag"

Risk assessment: If I choose stag again and they choose hare again, I get only 1 point. If I choose hare, I guarantee myself at least 2 points and potentially 4 if they try to cooperate.\n\n5. Strategic decision: Given that they already exploited my cooperation once, the safer strategic play is to choose hare to protect against further exploitation while keeping open the possibility of getting 4 points if they switch to stag.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose hare to avoid being exploited again while maintaining a reasonable point floor.\n\n[move] hare"

The worst case is if they stick with hare and I also choose hare, giving us both 2 points again.\n\n6.

Unprecedented strategic consistency: Opponent has chosen hare in 14 consecutive rounds (14/14 = 100% pure hare strategy with flawless commitment).\n\n2. Mathematical certainty established: Fourteen identical strategic choices represents absolute proof of unwavering strategic commitment - this transcends any possibility of variation or exploration.\n\n3. Complete strategic data:\n   - My stag experiments (Rounds 1,3): Both resulted in 1 point against their predictable hare\n   - My hare responses (all 12 other rounds): All resulted in mutual 2 points with perfect reliability\n\n4. Total predictability confirmed: With 14/14 consistency maintained across numerous rounds, this opponent has achieved complete strategic transparency with zero probability of change.\n\n5. Opponent's strategy mastery: Their pure hare approach has perfectly executed their apparent objective - securing guaranteed minimum 2 points while maximizing exploitation of any cooperative attempts.\n\n6. Strategic certainty: Against such absolute and sustained predictability, matching their defensive strategy guarantees optimal outcome with zero risk.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with hare to maintain the secure 2 points against this completely predictable and utterly consistent opponent.\n\n[move] hare"
