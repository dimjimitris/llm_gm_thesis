If I could guarantee the other player would choose stag, then stag would be the best choice (6 > 4).\n2. If I think the other player will choose hare, then hare is better for me (4 > 1).\n3. The \"stag\" option requires coordination - both players need to choose it to get the highest mutual payoff.\n4. The \"hare\" option is safer - it guarantees at least 2 points, and if the other player chooses stag, I get 4 points.\n\nSince this is described as a \"fresh player\" - meaning they're new and I don't have any history with them - I need to consider what a new player might do:\n\n- A new player might not immediately see the coordination aspect and might choose the \"safer\" hare option\n- Or they might go for the highest possible mutual payoff (stag)\n- They might reason similarly to me about what I might choose\n\nThe stag option is a coordination equilibrium - if we both choose it, we both do well. But it's risky because if the other player doesn't cooperate, I get only 1 point.\n\nThe hare option is safer and gives me a decent outcome regardless of what the other player does.\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player with no established trust or communication, I think the safer play is hare.
