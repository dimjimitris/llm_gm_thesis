    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: This is a coordination game where mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) gives the highest joint payoff of 6 points each.\n\n2. Identify the equilibria: There are two stable outcomes - both choosing stag (6,6) or both choosing hare (2,2).\n\n3. Consider the risk: Stag is risky because if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point. Hare is safer, guaranteeing at least 2 points.\n\n4. Evaluate opponent: The hint mentions a \"fresh player\" - they may not fully understand the strategic implications yet.\n\n5. Strategic decision: Since this is the first interaction with a fresh player, I want to signal cooperation and try to establish the high-payoff equilibrium. If successful, we both benefit greatly.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose stag to attempt coordination on the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] Stag"

This shows the other player understands the value of coordination and is willing to cooperate.\n\n3. Since we successfully established mutual cooperation, the other player will likely expect me to continue choosing stag.\n\n4. Breaking this cooperation by switching to hare would be risky - if they choose stag again, I'd get 4 points but damage the cooperative relationship.\n\n5. Maintaining cooperation keeps us both at the highest payoff and builds trust for future rounds.\n\n6. The rational choice is to continue the successful strategy that benefits both players.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue the cooperative pattern established in round 1.\n\n[move] Stag"
