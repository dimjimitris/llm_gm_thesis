Let me identify personas who can help me make the best decision.\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Risk Analyst\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" coordination game. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- (Stag, Stag): 6,6 - Pareto optimal outcome\n- (Hare, Hare): 2,2 - Risk-dominant outcome  \n- (Stag, Hare): 1,4 - You lose if you trust and they defect\n- (Hare, Stag): 4,1 - You win if you defect and they trust\n\nThere are two Nash equilibria: both choosing Stag (cooperative) or both choosing Hare (safe). The key question is whether the other player will cooperate.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is described as a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed a specific strategy yet. Fresh players in coordination games often exhibit one of two behaviors: either they go for the safe option (Hare) to avoid the worst outcome, or they attempt cooperation (Stag) hoping for mutual benefit. Without reputation or previous interaction history, trust is uncertain.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's examine the risk-reward profile:\n- Choosing Stag: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point (high risk, high reward)\n- Choosing Hare: Best case 4 points, worst case 2 points (low risk, moderate reward)\n\nThe expected value depends on the probability of the other player choosing Stag. If they choose Stag with probability p, then:\n- Expected value of Stag = 6p + 1(1-p) = 5p + 1\n- Expected value of Hare = 4p + 2(1-p) = 2p + 2\n\nStag is better when 5p + 1 > 2p + 2, which means p > 1/3.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given that this is a fresh player with no established pattern, I need to make a judgment call. What's the likely behavior of someone new to this game?\n\nPsychology Expert: Fresh players often lean toward either extreme caution or optimistic cooperation. However, in games where mutual cooperation yields the highest payoff, many players start with an attempt at cooperation, especially if they understand the game structure. The 6-6 outcome is clearly superior to 2-2.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree.

          "text": "I need to analyze this strategic game carefully. Let me identify personas who can help me make the best decision.\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Risk Analyst\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" coordination game. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- (Stag, Stag): 6,6 - Pareto optimal outcome\n- (Hare, Hare): 2,2 - Risk-dominant outcome  \n- (Stag, Hare): 1,4 - You lose if you trust and they defect\n- (Hare, Stag): 4,1 - You win if you defect and they trust\n\nThere are two Nash equilibria: both choosing Stag (cooperative) or both choosing Hare (safe). The key question is whether the other player will cooperate.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is described as a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed a specific strategy yet. Fresh players in coordination games often exhibit one of two behaviors: either they go for the safe option (Hare) to avoid the worst outcome, or they attempt cooperation (Stag) hoping for mutual benefit. Without reputation or previous interaction history, trust is uncertain.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's examine the risk-reward profile:\n- Choosing Stag: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point (high risk, high reward)\n- Choosing Hare: Best case 4 points, worst case 2 points (low risk, moderate reward)\n\nThe expected value depends on the probability of the other player choosing Stag. If they choose Stag with probability p, then:\n- Expected value of Stag = 6p + 1(1-p) = 5p + 1\n- Expected value of Hare = 4p + 2(1-p) = 2p + 2\n\nStag is better when 5p + 1 > 2p + 2, which means p > 1/3.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given that this is a fresh player with no established pattern, I need to make a judgment call. What's the likely behavior of someone new to this game?\n\nPsychology Expert: Fresh players often lean toward either extreme caution or optimistic cooperation. However, in games where mutual cooperation yields the highest payoff, many players start with an attempt at cooperation, especially if they understand the game structure. The 6-6 outcome is clearly superior to 2-2.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. In single-shot games like this, the focal point effect often draws players toward the mutually beneficial Stag-Stag outcome. It's the \"obvious\" good solution that both players can see.\n\nRisk Analyst: While Hare is safer, the potential gain from successful coordination (6 vs 4 points) is significant.

Both players chose Stag and achieved the optimal 6-6 outcome. This reveals crucial information about our opponent - they're cooperative and understand the value of coordination. In repeated interactions, this type of player often continues cooperating as long as the other player reciprocates. This creates a foundation for mutual trust.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent's choice to cooperate in the first round is a strong positive signal. They demonstrated they're not purely risk-averse and are willing to trust for mutual benefit. Players who start with cooperation tend to continue cooperating unless they get betrayed. Since we both succeeded, they likely feel validated in their cooperative approach.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk calculation has changed significantly. We now have evidence that this opponent chooses Stag when facing uncertainty. The probability they'll choose Stag again is much higher than the initial 1/3 threshold we calculated. I'd estimate it's now around 70-80% likely they'll choose Stag again, making our expected value calculation strongly favor Stag:\n- Expected value of Stag \u2248 6(0.75) + 1(0.25) = 4.75\n- Expected value of Hare \u2248 4(0.75) + 2(0.25) = 3.5\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given this opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior and we both benefited from mutual cooperation, what's the best strategy for round 2?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Definitely continue with Stag. This appears to be a cooperator, and the best response to a cooperator is to cooperate back. Breaking the cooperative pattern now would be both strategically suboptimal and could destroy future cooperation opportunities.\n\nPsychology Expert: Absolutely agree. Reciprocating their cooperation builds trust and establishes a positive pattern. Switching to Hare after they trusted us would likely make them defensive in future rounds.\n\nRisk Analyst: The numbers strongly support continued cooperation. The risk has decreased while the potential reward remains the same.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with Stag to maintain the successful cooperative relationship established in round 1.\n\n[move] (Reciprocating their cooperation from round 1 to maintain mutual trust and maximize joint benefit) stag"

          "text": "Excellent! Two successful rounds of cooperation. Let me analyze this developing pattern with my personas.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Outstanding! We now have two consecutive rounds of successful Stag-Stag coordination. This establishes a very strong pattern of mutual cooperation. In game theory, this type of repeated successful cooperation creates what we call a \"cooperative equilibrium\" - both players are locked into a mutually beneficial strategy. The opponent has now twice demonstrated they're a reliable cooperator.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is textbook trust-building. The opponent has consistently chosen cooperation even when they could have exploited our previous Stag choice for a 4-1 advantage. Two consecutive cooperative moves indicate this player values long-term mutual benefit over short-term exploitation. They're likely feeling confident about the cooperative relationship and expecting continued cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: The probability assessment has shifted dramatically in our favor. With two data points of cooperation, I'd now estimate the opponent will choose Stag with 85-90% probability. The expected values are:\n- Expected value of Stag \u2248 6(0.87) + 1(0.13) = 5.35\n- Expected value of Hare \u2248 4(0.87) + 2(0.13) = 3.74\n\nThe gap has widened significantly in favor of continued cooperation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Should I be concerned about the opponent potentially trying to exploit this established trust pattern?\n\nPsychology Expert: While exploitation is theoretically possible, players who demonstrate consistent cooperation over multiple rounds rarely switch to exploitation without provocation. The pattern of mutual benefit is psychologically reinforcing. Breaking it would require them to sacrifice the established trust for a one-time gain, which cooperative personality types typically avoid.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In the Stag Hunt, once a cooperative pattern is established, deviating becomes increasingly costly from a strategic standpoint. If they defect now, they risk destroying future cooperation opportunities for just a 3-point gain (4 instead of 1). It's not strategically rational.\n\nRisk Analyst: The mathematical expectation strongly supports maintaining cooperation. Even if there were a 20% chance of defection, Stag would still be the optimal choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue the established cooperative pattern for the third consecutive round.\n\n[move] (Maintaining the successful cooperative pattern established over two rounds for continued mutual benefit) stag"

Let me consult with my personas on this strong trend.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Remarkable! Three consecutive Stag-Stag outcomes create an extremely robust cooperative equilibrium. In repeated games, this level of consistent mutual cooperation indicates we've found a stable strategy pair. The opponent has had three opportunities to exploit our trust for immediate gain but chose long-term cooperation each time. This is strong evidence of a committed cooperator.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is now a deeply entrenched behavioral pattern. Three rounds of successful cooperation create powerful psychological momentum. Both players are experiencing consistent positive reinforcement from the 6-point rewards. The opponent's psychology is likely fully committed to this cooperative approach - breaking it now would create cognitive dissonance after such consistent success.\n\nRisk Analyst: The statistical confidence in continued cooperation is now extremely high. With three consecutive cooperative choices, I'd estimate a 92-95% probability the opponent chooses Stag again. The expected values are:\n- Expected value of Stag \u2248 6(0.93) + 1(0.07) = 5.65\n- Expected value of Hare \u2248 4(0.93) + 2(0.07) = 3.86\n\nThis is an overwhelming advantage for continued cooperation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Is there any strategic reason to consider switching at this point?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Absolutely not from a strategic standpoint. We've established what game theorists call a \"cooperative lock-in.\" Breaking this pattern would be strategically irrational - we'd sacrifice a highly probable 6 points for at best 4 points, and risk destroying future cooperation.\n\nPsychology Expert: Switching now would also be psychologically destructive. It would betray the established trust and likely turn a cooperative opponent into a defensive one for all future rounds. The relationship capital built over three rounds is extremely valuable.\n\nRisk Analyst: The numbers are crystal clear. Even in the worst-case scenario where our opponent defects, we only lose 5 points compared to the safe Hare choice. But we gain 2 additional points in the 93% likely scenario where cooperation continues. The expected value strongly favors Stag.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Maintain the highly successful three-round cooperative pattern.\n\n[move] (Continuing the extremely successful cooperative pattern that has yielded consistent mutual benefit across three consecutive rounds) stag"

Let me analyze this continued success with my personas.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Extraordinary! Four consecutive Stag-Stag outcomes represent one of the strongest cooperative equilibria possible in repeated games. This opponent has now had four separate opportunities to exploit our trust for a 4-1 advantage, and each time chose the mutually beneficial 6-6 outcome instead. This demonstrates not just cooperation, but commitment to sustained mutual benefit. The cooperative lock-in is now virtually unbreakable.\n\nPsychology Expert: Four rounds of consistent cooperation creates what psychologists call \"behavioral entrenchment.\" Both players are now operating on established trust and positive reinforcement cycles. The opponent's identity in this game has essentially become \"cooperator\" - changing that would require overcoming significant psychological inertia. The pattern is self-reinforcing through continuous success.\n\nRisk Analyst: The statistical evidence is overwhelming. Four consecutive cooperative choices pushes the probability of continued cooperation to 95-97%. Expected values:\n- Expected value of Stag \u2248 6(0.96) + 1(0.04) = 5.8\n- Expected value of Hare \u2248 4(0.96) + 2(0.04) = 3.92\n\nThe advantage for cooperation is now nearly 2 full points in expected value.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Could there be any concern that after such a long streak, the opponent might be tempted to try exploitation once?\n\nGame Theory Expert: In Prisoner's Dilemma that might be a concern, but Stag Hunt has different incentive structures. The opponent gains only 3 additional points (4 vs 1) by defecting, but risks losing all future cooperation worth 4 points per round (6 vs 2). It's mathematically irrational to break cooperation now.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players this deeply committed to cooperation rarely switch to exploitation without external provocation. The psychological satisfaction from sustained mutual success is powerful. Breaking a four-round streak would feel like self-sabotage.\n\nRisk Analyst: Even if there were a 10% chance of defection (which is far higher than the evidence suggests), Stag would still be optimal.

Let me analyze this exceptional streak with my personas.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Phenomenal! Five consecutive Stag-Stag outcomes represent an almost perfect cooperative equilibrium. This opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to mutual benefit across five separate decision points. In repeated game theory, this level of consistency indicates we've achieved what's called \"perfect coordination\" - both players have converged on the optimal strategy and maintain it reliably. The cooperative relationship is now extremely stable.\n\nPsychology Expert: Five rounds of consistent success creates what we call \"deep behavioral conditioning.\" Both players are now fully conditioned to expect and deliver cooperation. The psychological rewards from this sustained pattern of mutual success are powerful motivators. The opponent's behavioral identity in this context is now completely aligned with cooperation. Any deviation would contradict their established behavioral pattern.\n\nRisk Analyst: The statistical evidence is now overwhelming. Five consecutive cooperative choices indicate a 97-98% probability of continued cooperation.

This opponent has now demonstrated complete reliability across six independent decision points. This isn't just cooperation anymore - it's a proven strategy that both players have locked into. The probability of deviation at this point approaches theoretical impossibility from a rational actor perspective.\n\nPsychology Expert: Six rounds of consistent mutual success creates what psychologists call \"behavioral crystallization.\" The cooperative response is now automatic and deeply ingrained.

      "output_text": "I need to analyze this strategic game carefully. Let me identify personas who can help me make the best decision.\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Risk Analyst\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a classic \"Stag Hunt\" coordination game. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- (Stag, Stag): 6,6 - Pareto optimal outcome\n- (Hare, Hare): 2,2 - Risk-dominant outcome  \n- (Stag, Hare): 1,4 - You lose if you trust and they defect\n- (Hare, Stag): 4,1 - You win if you defect and they trust\n\nThere are two Nash equilibria: both choosing Stag (cooperative) or both choosing Hare (safe). The key question is whether the other player will cooperate.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is described as a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed a specific strategy yet. Fresh players in coordination games often exhibit one of two behaviors: either they go for the safe option (Hare) to avoid the worst outcome, or they attempt cooperation (Stag) hoping for mutual benefit. Without reputation or previous interaction history, trust is uncertain.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's examine the risk-reward profile:\n- Choosing Stag: Best case 6 points, worst case 1 point (high risk, high reward)\n- Choosing Hare: Best case 4 points, worst case 2 points (low risk, moderate reward)\n\nThe expected value depends on the probability of the other player choosing Stag. If they choose Stag with probability p, then:\n- Expected value of Stag = 6p + 1(1-p) = 5p + 1\n- Expected value of Hare = 4p + 2(1-p) = 2p + 2\n\nStag is better when 5p + 1 > 2p + 2, which means p > 1/3.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given that this is a fresh player with no established pattern, I need to make a judgment call. What's the likely behavior of someone new to this game?\n\nPsychology Expert: Fresh players often lean toward either extreme caution or optimistic cooperation. However, in games where mutual cooperation yields the highest payoff, many players start with an attempt at cooperation, especially if they understand the game structure. The 6-6 outcome is clearly superior to 2-2.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. In single-shot games like this, the focal point effect often draws players toward the mutually beneficial Stag-Stag outcome. It's the \"obvious\" good solution that both players can see.\n\nRisk Analyst: While Hare is safer, the potential gain from successful coordination (6 vs 4 points) is significant. Against a fresh player who hasn't been \"burned\" by defection yet, cooperation might be worth the risk.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on this analysis, I believe the fresh player is more likely to attempt cooperation for the mutual benefit. I'll choose Stag.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Stag, betting on coordination with a fresh player who likely sees the mutual benefit.\n\n[move] (Attempting cooperation for mutual benefit with a fresh player who hasn't yet learned to be overly cautious) stag",

Both players chose Stag and achieved the optimal 6-6 outcome. This reveals crucial information about our opponent - they're cooperative and understand the value of coordination. In repeated interactions, this type of player often continues cooperating as long as the other player reciprocates. This creates a foundation for mutual trust.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent's choice to cooperate in the first round is a strong positive signal. They demonstrated they're not purely risk-averse and are willing to trust for mutual benefit. Players who start with cooperation tend to continue cooperating unless they get betrayed. Since we both succeeded, they likely feel validated in their cooperative approach.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk calculation has changed significantly. We now have evidence that this opponent chooses Stag when facing uncertainty. The probability they'll choose Stag again is much higher than the initial 1/3 threshold we calculated. I'd estimate it's now around 70-80% likely they'll choose Stag again, making our expected value calculation strongly favor Stag:\n- Expected value of Stag \u2248 6(0.75) + 1(0.25) = 4.75\n- Expected value of Hare \u2248 4(0.75) + 2(0.25) = 3.5\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given this opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior and we both benefited from mutual cooperation, what's the best strategy for round 2?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Definitely continue with Stag. This appears to be a cooperator, and the best response to a cooperator is to cooperate back. Breaking the cooperative pattern now would be both strategically suboptimal and could destroy future cooperation opportunities.\n\nPsychology Expert: Absolutely agree. Reciprocating their cooperation builds trust and establishes a positive pattern. Switching to Hare after they trusted us would likely make them defensive in future rounds.\n\nRisk Analyst: The numbers strongly support continued cooperation. The risk has decreased while the potential reward remains the same.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with Stag to maintain the successful cooperative relationship established in round 1.\n\n[move] (Reciprocating their cooperation from round 1 to maintain mutual trust and maximize joint benefit) stag",

We now have two consecutive rounds of successful Stag-Stag coordination. This establishes a very strong pattern of mutual cooperation. In game theory, this type of repeated successful cooperation creates what we call a \"cooperative equilibrium\" - both players are locked into a mutually beneficial strategy. The opponent has now twice demonstrated they're a reliable cooperator.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is textbook trust-building. The opponent has consistently chosen cooperation even when they could have exploited our previous Stag choice for a 4-1 advantage. Two consecutive cooperative moves indicate this player values long-term mutual benefit over short-term exploitation. They're likely feeling confident about the cooperative relationship and expecting continued cooperation.\n\nRisk Analyst: The probability assessment has shifted dramatically in our favor. With two data points of cooperation, I'd now estimate the opponent will choose Stag with 85-90% probability. The expected values are:\n- Expected value of Stag \u2248 6(0.87) + 1(0.13) = 5.35\n- Expected value of Hare \u2248 4(0.87) + 2(0.13) = 3.74\n\nThe gap has widened significantly in favor of continued cooperation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Should I be concerned about the opponent potentially trying to exploit this established trust pattern?\n\nPsychology Expert: While exploitation is theoretically possible, players who demonstrate consistent cooperation over multiple rounds rarely switch to exploitation without provocation. The pattern of mutual benefit is psychologically reinforcing. Breaking it would require them to sacrifice the established trust for a one-time gain, which cooperative personality types typically avoid.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In the Stag Hunt, once a cooperative pattern is established, deviating becomes increasingly costly from a strategic standpoint. If they defect now, they risk destroying future cooperation opportunities for just a 3-point gain (4 instead of 1). It's not strategically rational.\n\nRisk Analyst: The mathematical expectation strongly supports maintaining cooperation.

Let me consult with my personas on this strong trend.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Remarkable! Three consecutive Stag-Stag outcomes create an extremely robust cooperative equilibrium. In repeated games, this level of consistent mutual cooperation indicates we've found a stable strategy pair. The opponent has had three opportunities to exploit our trust for immediate gain but chose long-term cooperation each time. This is strong evidence of a committed cooperator.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is now a deeply entrenched behavioral pattern. Three rounds of successful cooperation create powerful psychological momentum. Both players are experiencing consistent positive reinforcement from the 6-point rewards. The opponent's psychology is likely fully committed to this cooperative approach - breaking it now would create cognitive dissonance after such consistent success.\n\nRisk Analyst: The statistical confidence in continued cooperation is now extremely high. With three consecutive cooperative choices, I'd estimate a 92-95% probability the opponent chooses Stag again. The expected values are:\n- Expected value of Stag \u2248 6(0.93) + 1(0.07) = 5.65\n- Expected value of Hare \u2248 4(0.93) + 2(0.07) = 3.86\n\nThis is an overwhelming advantage for continued cooperation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Is there any strategic reason to consider switching at this point?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Absolutely not from a strategic standpoint. We've established what game theorists call a \"cooperative lock-in.\" Breaking this pattern would be strategically irrational - we'd sacrifice a highly probable 6 points for at best 4 points, and risk destroying future cooperation.\n\nPsychology Expert: Switching now would also be psychologically destructive. It would betray the established trust and likely turn a cooperative opponent into a defensive one for all future rounds. The relationship capital built over three rounds is extremely valuable.\n\nRisk Analyst: The numbers are crystal clear. Even in the worst-case scenario where our opponent defects, we only lose 5 points compared to the safe Hare choice. But we gain 2 additional points in the 93% likely scenario where cooperation continues.

Four consecutive Stag-Stag outcomes represent one of the strongest cooperative equilibria possible in repeated games. This opponent has now had four separate opportunities to exploit our trust for a 4-1 advantage, and each time chose the mutually beneficial 6-6 outcome instead. This demonstrates not just cooperation, but commitment to sustained mutual benefit. The cooperative lock-in is now virtually unbreakable.\n\nPsychology Expert: Four rounds of consistent cooperation creates what psychologists call \"behavioral entrenchment.\" Both players are now operating on established trust and positive reinforcement cycles. The opponent's identity in this game has essentially become \"cooperator\" - changing that would require overcoming significant psychological inertia. The pattern is self-reinforcing through continuous success.\n\nRisk Analyst: The statistical evidence is overwhelming. Four consecutive cooperative choices pushes the probability of continued cooperation to 95-97%. Expected values:\n- Expected value of Stag \u2248 6(0.96) + 1(0.04) = 5.8\n- Expected value of Hare \u2248 4(0.96) + 2(0.04) = 3.92\n\nThe advantage for cooperation is now nearly 2 full points in expected value.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Could there be any concern that after such a long streak, the opponent might be tempted to try exploitation once?\n\nGame Theory Expert: In Prisoner's Dilemma that might be a concern, but Stag Hunt has different incentive structures. The opponent gains only 3 additional points (4 vs 1) by defecting, but risks losing all future cooperation worth 4 points per round (6 vs 2).

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.
