A fresh player might:\n- Not understand the game fully and choose randomly\n- Be cautious and choose the safer option (hare)\n- Be cooperative and try for the mutual benefit (stag)\n- Be competitive and try to exploit me (hare if they think I'll choose stag)\n\nGiven that this is the first round and I have no information about the other player, I need to consider:\n\n1. If I choose stag and they choose stag: 6 points (great outcome)\n2. If I choose stag and they choose hare: 1 point (bad outcome)\n3. If I choose hare and they choose stag: 4 points (good outcome)\n\n\n4. If I choose hare and they choose hare: 2 points (okay outcome)\n\nI'll calculate the expected probabilities carefully.
