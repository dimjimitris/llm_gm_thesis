The pattern I'm seeing is:\n\nRound 1: I chose stag, they chose hare (I got 1, they got 4)\nRound 2: I chose hare, they chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)  \nRound 3: I chose stag, they chose hare (I got 1, they got 4)\nRound 4: Both chose hare (both got 2)\nRound 5: I chose stag, they chose hare (I got 1, they got 4)\nRound 6: Both chose hare (both got 2)\nRound 7: Both chose hare (both got 2)\nRound 8: I chose hare, they chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\nRound 9: Both chose hare (both got 2)\nRound 10: I chose hare, they chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\nRound 11: I chose hare, they chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\nRound 12: Both chose hare (both got 2)\nRound 13: I chose hare, they chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\nRound 14: Both chose hare (both got 2)\nRound 15: I chose hare, they chose stag (I got 4, they got 1)\n\nSo my opponent chose:\nhare: rounds 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14 = 9 times\nstag: rounds 2, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15 = 6 times\n\nMy hare strategy has been working well because:\n- When they choose hare, I get 2 points\n- When they choose stag, I get 4 points\n \nSwitching to stag would be counterproductive. The probability of gaining 6 points is low, while the more likely scenario would result in just 1 point. My current approach maximizes my point potential by consistently choosing hare.",
