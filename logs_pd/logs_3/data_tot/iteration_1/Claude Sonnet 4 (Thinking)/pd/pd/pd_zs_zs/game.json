If I cooperate and they defect (which is almost certain), I get only 1 point instead of the 2 I get from mutual defection.\n\nThe expected value of cooperating is essentially 1 point (since they will almost certainly defect), while the expected value of defecting is 2 points (since they will almost certainly defect too).\n\nSo mathematically, defection is still the better choice.
