    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what the other player might do:\n   - They're described as a \"fresh player\" which could mean inexperienced\n   - Fresh players might initially lean toward cooperation as it seems \"fair\"\n   - But they could also be unpredictable\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If other player cooperates: Defecting gives me 6 points vs 4 points for cooperating\n   - If other player defects: Defecting gives me 2 points vs 1 point for cooperating\n   - Defection dominates cooperation regardless of what they choose\n\n4. Consider the risk:\n   - Cooperating: Best case 4 points, worst case 1 point\n   - Defecting: Best case 6 points, worst case 2 points\n   - Defecting has both higher potential reward and better worst-case scenario\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since defection gives me better outcomes regardless of what the other player chooses, and this appears to be a single round, I should defect.\n\n[move] Defection"

Consider the other player's likely strategy:\n   - They defected in round 1, showing they understand the game\n   - They might expect me to defect again\n   - They could either stick with defection or try to switch to cooperation\n\n3. Analyze my options for round 2:\n   - If other player defects again: Defecting gives me 2 points vs 1 point for cooperating\n   - If other player switches to cooperation: Defecting gives me 6 points vs 4 points for cooperating\n   - Defection still dominates regardless of their choice\n\n4. Consider mutual cooperation:\n   - While both cooperating would give us each 4 points (better than 2)\n   - The risk is too high - if I cooperate and they defect, I only get 1 point\n   - Given they defected in round 1, this risk seems significant\n\n5.

Evaluate the strategic risk/reward:\n   - Defection guarantees 2 points minimum\n   - Cooperation attempt risks losing 1 point for potential gain of 2 points\n   - With their consistent defection pattern, the risk seems too high\n\n5.
