This is getting quite long, and I've been consistently reasoning the same way each time - that the opponent has established such a strong pattern that cooperation would be too risky.\n\nBut let me think about this differently. After 15 rounds of the same outcome, perhaps there's an argument that we're both stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium. However, the game theory logic still holds - if I cooperate and my opponent continues their established pattern (which they've done 15 times in a row), I get the worst outcome.\n\nThe rational choice is still defection given the overwhelming evidence of my opponent's behavior. Even though we're both missing out on the better mutual cooperation outcome (4 points each instead of 2), the risk of unilateral cooperation is too high.\n\nI should continue with defection based on the consistent logic I've been applying.",
