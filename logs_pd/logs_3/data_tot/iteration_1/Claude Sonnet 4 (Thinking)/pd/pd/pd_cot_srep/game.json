Consider one-shot vs repeated game: This seems like it might be a single interaction, which makes cooperation riskier since there's no future retaliation to worry about.\n\n5. Risk analysis: \n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 4 (good outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 6 (best outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 (mediocre outcome)\n   \nI'll choose defection.
