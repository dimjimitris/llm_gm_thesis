My opponent seems to be following a \"Tit-for-Two-Tats\" or similar forgiving strategy where:\n1. They start with cooperation attempts\n2. When I defect against their cooperation, they defect once in response\n3. Then they try cooperation again\n\nThey're being incredibly persistent and forgiving, always giving me another chance to cooperate despite me consistently exploiting their cooperation.\n\nFrom a pure game theory standpoint, defection has been working well for me - I either get 6 points (when they cooperate) or 2 points (when they defect), never the worst outcome of 1 point.\n\nHowever, I should consider: if this pattern continues indefinitely, and they keep alternating between cooperation and defection, I'm getting an average of about 4 points per round ((6+2)/2 = 4). But if we both cooperated consistently, we'd both get 4 points each round, which is the same average but more stable.\n\nStill, the risk remains that if I cooperate and they happen to defect (breaking their pattern), I get only 1 point. And since I can't be certain they'll continue this pattern, the safe play is still defection.",
