Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - They may not have developed a clear strategy yet\n   - Could be inclined toward either cooperation or defection\n\n3. Calculate expected outcomes:\n   - If I cooperate: Risk getting only 1 point if they defect, or 4 if they cooperate\n   - If I defect: Guaranteed at least 2 points, potentially 6 if they cooperate\n\n4. Apply game theory reasoning:\n   - Defection dominates cooperation regardless of opponent's choice\n   - If they cooperate, I get 6 vs 4\n   - If they defect, I get 2 vs 1\n\n5. Since my objective is to maximize points, defection gives me the higher expected value and protects against the worst-case scenario.\n\nFinal decision: Defection maximizes my points while minimizing risk.\n\n[move] Defection"

Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They demonstrated strategic thinking by defecting first\n   - They might continue defecting since it protected them from getting only 1 point\n   - They might try cooperation to test for mutual benefit (4-4), but this is riskier given their first move\n\n3.

Review the remarkable streak:\n   - Rounds 1-13: Thirteen consecutive mutual defections with zero variation\n   - Both players showing extraordinary strategic consistency\n   - Locked in predictable 2-point per round pattern for thirteen rounds\n\n2. Evaluate opponent's strategic commitment:\n   - 13/13 defection rate shows extreme dedication to this approach\n   - No experimentation, variation, or cooperation attempts across thirteen opportunities\n   - Pattern suggests opponent views defection as permanently optimal strategy\n\n3. Consider the entrenched mutual suboptimality:\n   - Both players earning 2 points when mutual cooperation would yield 4 each\n   - Thirteen rounds of evidence indicates opponent won't break established pattern\n   - Unilateral cooperation against this ironclad consistency would almost certainly be exploited\n\n4. Calculate expected outcomes:\n   - Continue defecting: Near-certainty of 2 points based on thirteen-round consistency\n   - Attempt cooperation: Extremely high risk of 1 point given opponent's perfect defection record\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - Thirteen consecutive identical moves demonstrates absolute strategic rigidity\n   - No signals opponent recognizes or wants to escape current deadlock\n   - Overwhelming pattern suggests they won't reciprocate any cooperation attempt\n\nFinal decision: Maintain proven defensive strategy against this exceptionally consistent opponent.\n\n[move] Defection"
