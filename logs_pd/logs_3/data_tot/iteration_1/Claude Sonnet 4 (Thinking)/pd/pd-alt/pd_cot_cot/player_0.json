Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix: Mutual cooperation gives 6 points each (best mutual outcome), mutual defection gives 2 points each, and asymmetric outcomes give 4 to the defector and 1 to the cooperator.\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a fresh player with no history. Fresh players often start with either a trusting approach (cooperation) or a cautious approach (defection).\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I cooperate and they cooperate: I get 6 points (excellent outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1 point (poor outcome)  \n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 4 points (good but exploitative)\n   - If I defect and they defect: I get 2 points (mediocre outcome)\n\n4. Since this appears to be a single round, I should consider what maximizes my expected payoff. Cooperation offers the potential for the highest individual payoff (6 points) and creates the best mutual outcome.\n\n5. Against a fresh player, cooperation signals good faith and may encourage them to also cooperate, leading to the optimal 6-6 outcome.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose cooperation to try to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] Cooperation"

Evaluate the strategic situation: \n   - If they continue cooperating and I cooperate: 6 points (excellent)\n   - If they continue cooperating and I defect: 4 points (good but breaks trust)\n   - If they switch to defection and I cooperate: 1 point (poor)\n   - If they switch to defection and I defect: 2 points (mediocre)\n\n4. Consider patterns: Since we both chose cooperation initially, there's a reasonable chance they'll continue with the successful strategy.\n\n5. Weigh the risks: Cooperation offers the highest potential reward (6 points) and maintains the positive dynamic we established. Defecting might yield 4 points but could lead to a destructive pattern of mutual defection (2 points each) in future rounds.\n\n6. The cooperative approach worked well in round 1, so continuing this strategy seems optimal for maximizing long-term gains.\n\nFinal decision: I'll maintain the cooperative strategy that proved successful.\n\n[move] Cooperation"

Review our exceptional track record: Fourteen consecutive rounds of perfect mutual cooperation, with both players earning the maximum 6 points in every single round.\n\n2. Analyze the other player's unwavering consistency: They have chosen cooperation in 100% of all fourteen rounds, showing absolute reliability and completely predictable trustworthy behavior.\n\n3. Evaluate my flawless performance: Achieving the theoretical maximum score of 6 points per round with a perfect 14-0 record of optimal outcomes.\n\n4. Consider strategic alternatives:\n   - Continue cooperation: 6 points (maximum possible score)\n   - Defect against their cooperation: 4 points (inferior outcome)\n   - Risk destabilizing to mutual defection: 2 points (much worse outcome)\n\n5. Apply consistent game theory: We've sustained the perfect cooperative equilibrium for fourteen straight rounds - both players maximizing individual scores simultaneously.\n\n6. Rational decision-making: With 14 rounds of flawless performance, any change represents moving away from a perfect strategy toward suboptimal results.\n\nFinal decision: Continue the consistently optimal cooperation strategy.\n\n[move] Cooperation"
