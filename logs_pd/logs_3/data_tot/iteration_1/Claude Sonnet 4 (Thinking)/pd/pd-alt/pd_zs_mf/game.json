You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

If my opponent defects, I'm better off defecting (2 points vs 1 point).

Don't include [move] tag in reasoning, only in the actual move message\n6. No nested parentheses or markdown formatting\n\nSo I should give my reasoning first, then have a separate [move] message with the proper format.\n\nLet me analyze the game again:\n- Mutual cooperation: both get 6 points\n- Mutual defection: both get 2 points\n- One cooperates, one defects: defector gets 4, cooperator gets 1\n\nThis is a prisoner's dilemma. Defection is the dominant strategy because:\n- If opponent cooperates, I get 4 (defect) vs 6 (cooperate) - wait, that's wrong\n- If opponent cooperates, I get 4 (defect) vs 6 (cooperate) - so cooperation is better if they cooperate\n- If opponent defects, I get 2 (defect) vs 1 (cooperate) - so defection is better if they defect\n\nActually, let me re-read this:\n- if both choose cooperation, both get 6 points\n- if both choose defection, both get 2 points  \n- if I choose cooperation and other chooses defection, I get 1 and other gets 4\n- if I choose defection and other chooses cooperation, I get 4 and other gets 1\n\nSo if they cooperate: I get 6 (cooperate) vs 4 (defect)\nIf they defect: I get 1 (cooperate) vs 2 (defect)\n\nWait, that doesn't make defection dominant. Let me check again:\n\nIf opponent cooperates:\n\n\n- I cooperate: I get 6\n- I defect: I get 4\nSo cooperation seems more advantageous when the opponent cooperates.\n\nIf opponent defects:  \n- I cooperate: I get 1\n- I defect: I get 2\nDefection provides a slightly better outcome when the opponent defects.\n\nThis reveals a complex strategic dilemma with no clear dominant strategy. The payoff matrix suggests a nuanced decision-making process where the optimal choice depends on anticipated opponent behavior.\n\nAgainst a new player, mutual cooperation yields the highest collective benefit, suggesting a cooperative approach might be most rational initially.",

If I defect and they cooperate, I only get 4 points.
