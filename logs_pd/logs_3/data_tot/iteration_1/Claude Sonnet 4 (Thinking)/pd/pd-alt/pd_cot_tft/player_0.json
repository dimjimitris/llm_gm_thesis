Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what the other player might do:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - Fresh players may be more likely to start with cooperation before learning to be strategic\n   - They haven't been \"burned\" by defectors yet\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they cooperate and I cooperate: I get 6 points (excellent)\n   - If they cooperate and I defect: I get 4 points (good but exploitative)\n   - If they defect and I cooperate: I get 1 point (terrible)\n   - If they defect and I defect: I get 2 points (poor)\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - Since this is a fresh player, cooperation seems more likely from them\n   - Mutual cooperation gives the highest joint benefit and good individual reward\n   - Starting with cooperation may establish a positive pattern\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will cooperate to potentially achieve the mutually beneficial outcome while the other player is still \"fresh.\"\n\n[move] Cooperation"

Predict Round 12:\n   - Since I defected in Round 11, they will defect in Round 12\n   - This pattern has been flawless across 11 rounds\n\n3. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - Currently tied at 25 points each - this is optimal given their strategy\n   - Mutual defection gives us 2 points each per round\n   - Any attempt to break into cooperation costs me 3 points permanently\n\n4. Consider the trade-off:\n   - Stay tied with 2 points per round vs fall 3 points behind but get 6 points per round in cooperation\n   - Since I don't know how many rounds remain, the guaranteed tie is safer\n   - Being behind by 3 points is a permanent disadvantage\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Maintain the tied position by matching their predicted defection.\n\n[move] Defection"
