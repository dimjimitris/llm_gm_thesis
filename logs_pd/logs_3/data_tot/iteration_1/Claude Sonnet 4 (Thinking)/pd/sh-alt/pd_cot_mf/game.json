Key observations:\n   - If we both cooperate (choose stag), we both get a good outcome (4 points each)\n   - If we both defect (choose hare), we both get a mediocre outcome (2 points each)\n   - If one cooperates and one defects, the defector gets the best outcome (6 points) while the cooperator gets the worst (1 point)\n\n4.

The risk of switching to stag and getting only 1 point while they get 6 seems very high given this pattern.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether there might be any strategic reason to occasionally test cooperation, especially after so many rounds of the same outcome.

This is getting quite repetitive and I'm starting to wonder if there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about this differently:\n\n1. We've established an incredibly stable pattern over 14 rounds\n2. Both players are clearly rational and understand the game\n3. We're both stuck in a suboptimal Nash equilibrium\n4. The opportunity cost is significant - we're each leaving 2 points on the table every round\n\nBut here's a key insight: after 14 rounds of identical behavior, the other player might also be thinking about this pattern. They might be considering that continued mutual hare play is suboptimal for both of us.\n\nHowever, the risk is still there - if I switch to stag and they don't, I get 1 point while they get 6. That's a loss of 1 point for me.\n\nBut let me think about this from a game theory perspective:\n- We're clearly both sophisticated players who understand the dominant strategy\n- We've both demonstrated we can stick to rational play\n- After 14 rounds, we might both be thinking about the inefficiency of this outcome\n- There could be an implicit understanding that we both want to move to the better outcome\n\nStill, the risk remains high. Without communication, there's no way to coordinate. The other player has given me no signal of wanting to cooperate.\n\nI think I should stick with hare again.
