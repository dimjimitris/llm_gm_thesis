Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: This is a classic coordination game where mutual cooperation (both stag) gives the best joint outcome (4,4), but there's risk of exploitation.\n\n2. Consider the opponent: Playing against a \"fresh player\" means they likely don't have established patterns or deep strategic understanding yet.\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I choose stag and they choose stag: I get 4 points (good)\n   - If I choose stag and they choose hare: I get only 1 point (bad)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose stag: I get 6 points (excellent)\n   - If I choose hare and they choose hare: I get 2 points (safe)\n\n4. Consider fresh player behavior: A new player might either play it safe with hare, or might try to exploit by choosing hare while hoping I choose stag.\n\n5. Risk assessment: The downside of choosing stag if they choose hare is severe (only 1 point), while choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points with upside potential of 6.\n\nFinal decision: Against an unknown fresh player, the safer strategy is hare, which protects against exploitation while still offering good upside.\n\n[move] hare"

Consider what this reveals about my opponent: They played safely rather than trying to exploit, suggesting they might be cooperative rather than purely aggressive.\n\n3. Evaluate the coordination opportunity: Since we both showed caution, there might be potential to establish mutual cooperation (both stag) for higher joint payoffs.\n\n4. Assess the risk: The opponent might stick with the safe hare strategy, or they might also see this as an opportunity to coordinate on stag.\n\n5. Consider signaling: By choosing stag, I signal willingness to cooperate and trust, which could lead to better outcomes in future rounds if the opponent reciprocates.\n\n6. Weigh the downside: If they stick with hare while I choose stag, I only get 1 point, but this could be worth the risk to establish cooperation.\n\nFinal decision: Since we both played cautiously in round 1, I'll attempt to signal cooperation and trust by choosing stag, hoping to establish a mutually beneficial pattern.\n\n[move] stag"

Analyze the perfect record: Opponent has chosen hare in ALL 14 consecutive rounds - this represents absolute strategic consistency without any deviation throughout the entire extended game.\n\n2. Evaluate the maximum evidence: A 14/14 hare pattern provides the highest possible statistical confidence in their unwavering commitment to risk-averse play.\n\n3. Review my consistent success: I've achieved steady 2-point returns in 12 consecutive rounds by reliably matching their completely predictable hare strategy.\n\n4. Calculate expected outcomes:\n   - They choose hare (virtually certain): My hare = 2 points, My stag = 1 point\n   - They choose stag (statistically insignificant): My hare = 6 points, My stag = 4 points\n\n5. Strategic mathematics: Hare provides superior or equal returns in every possible scenario against this utterly predictable opponent.\n\n6. Optimal decision logic: With 14 perfect repetitions establishing the strongest conceivable behavioral pattern, any deviation from the proven optimal response would be strategically irrational.\n\nFinal decision: Against an opponent with a flawless 14/14 hare record showing maximum strategic consistency, the optimal choice remains hare for another reliable 2 points.\n\n[move] hare"
