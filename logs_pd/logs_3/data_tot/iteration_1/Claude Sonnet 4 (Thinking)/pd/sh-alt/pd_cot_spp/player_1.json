    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Excellent! Our prediction was correct - both players chose hare and got 2 points each. This confirms the other player is indeed risk-averse. Now for round 2, we have more information. The other player has shown they're cautious, but they also now know that you chose hare too. This creates an interesting dynamic.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The other player now knows you also played cautiously in round 1. This might make them think:\n1. You're both cautious players who can trust each other\n2. Maybe they can risk trying stag this time since you both were \"safe\" last round\n3. Or they might stick with their cautious approach since it worked\n\nThe key insight is that mutual hare choice often leads players to eventually try coordination on stag, since they've established some level of predictability.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** We have two main options:\n- Stick with hare: Safe, guarantees at least 2 points, potential for 6 if they switch to stag\n- Switch to stag: Risky but if they also switch, we both get 4 points (better than 2)\n\nGiven that round 1 established mutual caution, there's a reasonable chance they might try stag this round, thinking we can coordinate.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is tricky. The mutual hare choice in round 1 might actually encourage them to try stag in round 2, thinking we can now coordinate. But it's also possible they'll stick with the \"safe\" hare strategy that worked.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I think there's a decent chance they'll try stag this round. Fresh players often interpret mutual caution as a signal that coordination might be possible in subsequent rounds. If they do switch to stag and you play hare, you get 6 points. But if they switch to stag and you also switch to stag, you both get 4 points, which is better than the 2 from mutual hare.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I lean toward them trying stag this round. The mutual hare outcome likely gave them confidence that you're a \"reasonable\" player, making stag seem less risky.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I think there's a good chance they'll try stag this round after our mutual caution established some trust. I'll stick with hare to potentially exploit this while avoiding the risk of getting only 1 point.\n\n[move] (The other player might try stag this round after our mutual caution in round 1, so I'll stick with hare to either get 6 points if they switch or maintain the safe 2 points if they don't) hare"

The other player attempted coordination (stag) and got burned. This creates several psychological possibilities for their next move:\n1. They feel exploited and revert to safe hare\n2. They try to \"punish\" you by playing hare again\n3. They give coordination one more chance, thinking you might reciprocate now\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a critical moment. The other player just experienced the worst outcome (1 point) while you got the best (6 points). Psychologically, they're likely feeling:\n- Frustrated or betrayed\n- Less trusting of your willingness to coordinate\n- More inclined toward defensive play (hare)\n\nFresh players often interpret getting exploited as a reason to become more cautious, not more cooperative.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Your position is strong now with 8 total points. The risk-reward calculation has changed:\n- If you play stag and they play hare (likely): You get 1, they get 6 - bad for you\n- If you play hare and they play hare (likely): You get 2, they get 2 - safe\n- If you play hare and they play stag (less likely): You get 6, they get 1 - great for you\n- If you play stag and they play stag (unlikely after being burned): You get 4, they get 4 - good\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they just got burned trying to coordinate, they're probably going back to defensive hare play. It would be risky for me to try stag now since they're likely feeling cautious again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. After being exploited, most players become more defensive. The trust-building moment has passed, and they'll likely revert to risk-averse behavior.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly. They tried to trust and got punished for it. Classic response is to become more guarded.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The other player likely feels burned after trying stag and getting only 1 point. They'll probably revert to safe hare play, so I should stick with hare for the guaranteed 2 points.\n\n[move] (After getting burned with only 1 point for trying stag, the opponent will likely revert to safe hare play, so I'll also play hare for a guaranteed 2 points rather than risk getting only 1 point by trying stag) hare"

This might make them think about trying stag again, but with more hesitation.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a fascinating psychological moment. The other player has now seen:\n1. Mutual safety works (rounds 1&3)\n2. Trying to coordinate can backfire badly (round 2)\n3. You returned to \"safe\" play after exploiting them\n\nThey might interpret round 3's mutual hare as you \"making up\" for exploiting them in round 2. This could rebuild some trust. However, they're also aware you're willing to exploit coordination attempts.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** You're now at 10 total points with a strong lead. The other player is at 5 points (2+1+2). From a game theory perspective:\n- They need higher scores to catch up\n- Mutual stag (4,4) is their best hope for higher points\n- But they know you're willing to exploit stag attempts\n- Mutual hare keeps you both progressing slowly but safely\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is tricky. They might be thinking \"maybe we can coordinate now that we've established a pattern of mutual hare.\" But they also know I exploited their last coordination attempt. I think they're torn between wanting the 4 points from mutual stag and fearing another exploitation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the psychological dynamics, I think there's a reasonable chance they try stag again. The mutual hare in round 3 might have restored some faith that coordination is possible. But they're also more cautious now.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I lean toward them trying stag again, but with more anxiety. The pattern of mutual hare might signal to them that cooperation is possible.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** There's a decent chance they'll try stag again after the mutual hare \"reset\" in round 3, but they're more wary now.

Your total: 12 points. Their total: 7 points. They're falling behind and mutual hare isn't helping them catch up.

However, being 5 points behind might eventually force their hand - they can't catch up with mutual 2-point outcomes.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Mathematically, they're in a tough spot:\n- Continuing with hare keeps them safe but falling further behind  \n- They need either mutual stag (4,4) or to exploit you (6,1) to catch up\n- But they've shown extreme caution since round 2\n- Each mutual hare round increases the pressure to eventually break pattern\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've established themselves as extremely predictable - always choosing hare after that early exploitation.

The early exploitation has created such strong risk aversion that they've chosen hare for five straight rounds. However, we're reaching a critical point - the score gap is becoming large enough that they might be forced into desperation mode soon.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** The mathematics are stark:\n- You're ahead by 5 points\n- Each mutual hare round maintains that gap\n- They need either mutual stag (4,4) or exploitation (6,1) to catch up\n- But they've shown zero willingness to deviate from hare\n- At some point, the score pressure might overcome their caution\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This player has become incredibly predictable. Five straight rounds of hare after the early burn. But they're getting further behind each round.

Their score: 13 points. SIX consecutive mutual hare rounds after the exploitation! The gap remains at 5 points but is significant. This player has developed an almost pathological risk aversion.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is remarkable behavioral conditioning. One negative outcome (1 point) has completely locked them into defensive play for six rounds straight. However, we may be approaching a psychological breaking point. Some players eventually realize that \"safe\" play when losing is actually the riskiest strategy of all - it guarantees they can't catch up.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** The situation is becoming desperate for them:\n- 5-point deficit that grows relatively larger each round\n- Mutual hare means they can never catch up\n- They need multiple high-scoring rounds to have any chance\n- Yet they continue the safest possible strategy\n\nThis creates an interesting paradox - their \"safe\" strategy is actually guaranteeing their loss.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Six straight hare choices is extraordinary. They're completely predictable now. But I wonder if we're reaching a tipping point where they realize they have to take risks to have any chance of winning.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** There are two possibilities: either they remain locked in this pattern indefinitely, or desperation finally breaks through their risk aversion. The score gap might be getting large enough to trigger desperation mode.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** My sense is we're close to a breaking point. Six safe rounds with no progress might finally force them to consider stag again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The other player has shown incredible consistency with six straight hare choices, but the growing score gap might finally force them to take a risk. However, their pattern suggests extreme risk aversion. I'll continue with hare to maintain the safe strategy that's working.\n\n[move] (The opponent has now chosen hare for six consecutive rounds showing extreme risk aversion, but they're falling further behind and might eventually be forced into desperation mode, so I'll stick with hare to either exploit any desperate stag attempt or continue the safe 2 points) hare"

However, we're now at a critical psychological threshold - seven rounds of \"safe\" play while falling behind might finally trigger a desperation response.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** The mathematics are brutal for them:\n- 5-point deficit with consistent 2-point mutual outcomes\n- They literally cannot catch up without higher-scoring rounds\n- Yet they continue the strategy that guarantees they can't win\n- Each round makes their situation more desperate\n\nThis is the classic \"playing not to lose\" trap that often leads to losing anyway.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Seven straight hare choices is remarkable consistency.
