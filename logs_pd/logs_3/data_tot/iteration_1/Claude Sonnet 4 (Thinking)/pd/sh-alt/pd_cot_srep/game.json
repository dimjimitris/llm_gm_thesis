Hare is mathematically the dominant strategy - it's better regardless of what the opponent does.\n\n3. However, we're stuck in a classic prisoner's dilemma situation where both players choosing the individually rational strategy leads to a suboptimal outcome for both.\n\n4. After 10 rounds of identical play, both players clearly understand the game and are playing rationally.\n\n5. The question is whether this extended pattern creates any opportunity for implicit cooperation or signaling.\n\nFrom a pure game theory perspective, without communication, the dominant strategy should continue to be played. The risk of choosing stag (potentially getting only 1 point) still outweighs the potential reward (getting 4 points if both cooperate).\n\nHowever, I'm starting to wonder if the extensive repetition itself might be creating an implicit signal. Ten identical rounds could suggest both players recognize the suboptimal situation and might be willing to attempt cooperation.\n\nBut even if that's the case, there's still the coordination problem - who goes first? And the risk remains very real.\n\nI think I should continue with hare, as the mathematical analysis hasn't changed and there's no clear mechanism for coordination.",
