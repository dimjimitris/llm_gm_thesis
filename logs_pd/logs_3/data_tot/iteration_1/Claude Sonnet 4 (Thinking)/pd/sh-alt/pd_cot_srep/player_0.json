Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the cooperation risk with extensive data:\n   - Twelve rounds of evidence strongly suggests opponent will choose hare again\n   - Risk of choosing stag: almost certain to receive 1 point based on established pattern\n   - No indication opponent is considering deviation from successful strategy\n\n5. Reconfirm dominant strategy mathematics:\n   - Against opponent's stag: hare yields 6 vs 4 for stag\n   - Against opponent's hare: hare yields 2 vs 1 for stag  \n   - Hare remains mathematically superior regardless of opponent choice\n\n6. Apply empirical evidence to strategic decision:\n   - Twelve rounds of consistent opponent behavior supports prediction of continued hare choice\n   - No rational basis to expect pattern disruption\n   - Maintaining proven approach minimizes risk\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the empirically validated dominant strategy.\n\n[move] hare"

Note the remarkable consistency: Thirteen consecutive rounds of both players choosing hare, each earning 2 points.\n\n2. Assess the strength of this behavioral evidence:\n   - Thirteen rounds represents exceptionally strong predictive data\n   - No variation, experimentation, or cooperation signaling has occurred\n   - The pattern demonstrates both players' commitment to risk-averse dominant strategy\n\n3. Evaluate the accumulated missed opportunities:\n   - Thirteen rounds of (2,2) instead of potential (4,4) represents massive foregone mutual benefit\n   - Yet this doesn't alter the fundamental risk-reward structure of the current round\n   - Historical outcomes don't change current strategic mathematics\n\n4. Calculate cooperation risk with extensive empirical data:\n   - Thirteen rounds of evidence suggests >99% probability opponent will choose hare\n   - Choosing stag carries near-certain risk of receiving worst outcome (1 point)\n   - No rational basis exists to expect opponent strategy change\n\n5. Reconfirm dominant strategy principles:\n   - Hare beats stag against both opponent choices: 6 vs 4, and 2 vs 1\n   - Mathematical superiority persists regardless of game history\n   - Empirical evidence reinforces theoretical prediction\n\n6.

Evaluate this exceptional behavioral pattern:\n   - Fourteen rounds provides overwhelming evidence of opponent's strategic commitment\n   - Zero deviations or cooperation attempts across extensive play\n   - Pattern demonstrates both players understand and consistently apply dominant strategy\n\n3. Consider the massive cumulative opportunity cost:\n   - Fourteen rounds of (2,2) when (4,4) is achievable represents enormous foregone mutual benefit\n   - Total points: 28 each instead of potential 56 each\n   - Yet individual round payoff structure remains unchanged\n\n4. Analyze cooperation probability with extensive empirical data:\n   - Fourteen rounds of identical behavior suggests near-certain opponent will choose hare\n   - Probability of cooperation attempt appears virtually zero based on evidence\n   - Risk of choosing stag remains essentially certain 1-point outcome\n\n5. Reconfirm strategic fundamentals:\n   - Hare maintains mathematical dominance: 6 vs 4 against stag, 2 vs 1 against hare\n   - Opponent rationality demonstrated through fourteen rounds of optimal individual play\n   - No indication of willingness to accept coordination risk\n\n6. Apply overwhelming empirical evidence:\n   - Fourteen rounds of consistent behavior supports prediction of continued hare choice\n   - No strategic justification exists for deviating from proven approach\n   - Risk management favors maintaining established successful pattern\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the strategy supported by both mathematical dominance and overwhelming empirical evidence.\n\n[move] hare"
