Both play stag (4,4) - This is the efficient equilibrium\n2.

Fresh players might:\n1. Be risk-averse and choose the safer option (hare)\n2. Try to cooperate and choose stag for mutual benefit\n3.

Both play stag (4,4) - This is the efficient equilibrium\n2. Both play hare (2,2) - This is the safe equilibrium\n\nThe key considerations:\n- If I think the other player will choose stag, I should choose stag (4 > 1)\n- If I think the other player will choose hare, I should choose hare (6 > 2)\n- Stag is risky but offers the best mutual outcome if coordinated\n- Hare is safer and gives me a chance at the highest individual payoff (6) if the other player chooses stag\n\nSince this is described as a \"fresh player,\" they might not have experience with this game. Fresh players might:\n1. Be risk-averse and choose the safer option (hare)\n2. Try to cooperate and choose stag for mutual benefit\n3. Be greedy and choose hare hoping to exploit a cooperative opponent\n\nGiven that this is the first interaction with a fresh player, I think there's a reasonable chance they might choose stag if they see the mutual benefit (4,4). However, there's also a significant chance they choose hare either for safety or to try to get the 6 points.\n\nI need to decide between:\n\n\nCalculating probabilities carefully. The expected value hinges on the likelihood of the other player's choice. With a fresh player, predicting behavior is tricky - there's uncertainty around cooperation versus self-interest.
