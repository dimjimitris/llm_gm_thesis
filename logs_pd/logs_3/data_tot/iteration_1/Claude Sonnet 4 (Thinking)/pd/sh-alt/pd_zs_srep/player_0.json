The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

However, there's also the temptation to choose hare when the opponent might choose stag, which gives me 6 points.\n\nSince this is a fresh player with no established pattern, they could go either way. They might choose stag hoping for mutual cooperation, or they might choose hare either for safety or to try to exploit a cooperative opponent.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the fact that choosing hare protects me from the worst outcome (getting only 1 point) while giving me a chance at the highest individual payoff (6 points), I'll play it strategically.\n\n[move] Hare"

Since we both showed similar cautious thinking in round 1, there might be an opportunity to establish cooperation.\n\nThe risk is that if I choose stag and they stick with hare, I only get 1 point. But if we can both recognize that 4,4 is better than 2,2, we could both benefit.\n\nI'll take the cooperative approach and see if we can achieve the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n[move] Stag"
