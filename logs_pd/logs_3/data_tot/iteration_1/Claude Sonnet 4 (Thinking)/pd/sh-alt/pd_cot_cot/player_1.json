Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluate dominant strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses stag: hare gives me 6 vs stag giving me 4\n   - If opponent chooses hare: hare gives me 2 vs stag giving me 1\n   - Hare dominates stag in both scenarios\n\n5.

Consider my opponent's likely thinking for this round:\n   - They might stick with hare since it worked and is strategically sound\n   - They might try to switch to stag hoping I'll also switch for mutual cooperation (4 points each)\n   - But there's risk in assuming coordination without communication\n\n3. Re-examine the payoff matrix:\n   - If opponent chooses hare: hare gives me 2 vs stag giving me 1\n   - If opponent chooses stag: hare gives me 6 vs stag giving me 4\n   - Hare still strictly dominates stag in both scenarios\n\n4. Consider the risk-reward:\n   - Hare guarantees I won't get the worst outcome (1 point)\n   - Hare gives me the chance for the best individual outcome (6 points)\n   - Even if we both choose hare again, 2 points is better than the 1 point I'd get if I chose stag and they chose hare\n\n5.

Confirm the strategic fundamentals remain constant:\n   - The payoff matrix is unchanged from the first round\n   - Hare remains the strictly dominant strategy in all scenarios\n   - Game theory principles are independent of historical patterns\n\n3. Consider opponent's demonstrated pattern:\n   - Thirteen identical choices show complete commitment to the safe strategy\n   - My opponent has never deviated from the risk-averse approach\n   - This consistency indicates they understand the risks and will likely continue\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic calculation:\n   - Hare guarantees avoiding the worst outcome (1 point) regardless of opponent's choice\n   - Hare maintains potential for the best individual outcome (6 points) if opponent switches\n   - Switching to stag introduces unnecessary risk for uncertain mutual benefit\n   - The dominant strategy remains mathematically optimal\n\n5. Decision: Continue with the proven dominant strategy that maximizes expected value while eliminating downside risk.\n\n[move] hare"
