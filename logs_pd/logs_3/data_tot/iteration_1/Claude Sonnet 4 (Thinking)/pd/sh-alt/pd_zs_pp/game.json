If both players choose Stag, we both get 4, which is better than if we both choose Hare (both get 2).\n\nBut since I'm told this is a \"fresh player\" and I don't know their strategy, and this appears to be a one-shot game, I should focus on maximizing my expected payoff or at least securing a good minimum.\n\nSince Hare gives me a better guaranteed outcome (minimum 2 vs minimum 1) and potentially the highest payoff (6), I think Hare is the safer and more rational choice, especially against an unknown opponent.",
