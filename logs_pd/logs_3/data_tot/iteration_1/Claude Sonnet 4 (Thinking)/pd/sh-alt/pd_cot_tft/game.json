Let me understand the payoff matrix:\n\n- Both choose stag: Both get 4 points\n- Both choose hare: Both get 2 points  \n- I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, other gets 6 points\n- I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, other gets 1 point\n\nSo the payoff matrix looks like:\n```\n                Other Player\n                Stag    Hare\nMe    Stag      4,4     1,6\n      Hare      6,1     2,2\n```\n\nNow I need to think strategically:\n\n1. If I think the other player will choose stag, then I should choose hare (6 > 4)\n2. If I think the other player will choose hare, then I should choose hare (2 > 1)\n\nSo from a purely selfish perspective, hare dominates stag - no matter what the other player does, I'm better off choosing hare.\n\nHowever, there's a cooperative element here. If we both choose stag, we both get 4 points, which is better than if we both choose hare (2 points each). But the risk is that if I choose stag and they choose hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6.\n\nSince this is described as playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they might not have developed a strategy yet. They could go either way.\n\nGiven that:\n- Hare is the dominant strategy from a game theory perspective\n- The other player is fresh/new and might not think strategically\n- The risk of choosing stag when they choose hare is quite high (1 vs 6 points)\n\nI think the safest and most rational choice is hare.",
