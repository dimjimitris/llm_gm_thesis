The cooperative outcome (both stag) gives us both 4 points, which is good.\n2. The safe outcome (both hare) gives us both 2 points, which is okay.\n3. The risky outcomes are asymmetric - one player gets 6, the other gets 1.\n\nKey considerations:\n- If I think the other player will choose stag, I should choose stag (4 points vs 6 points if I choose hare)\n- If I think the other player will choose hare, I should choose hare (2 points vs 1 point if I choose stag)\n\nWait, let me re-read this:\n- If I choose stag and other chooses hare: I get 1, other gets 6\n- If I choose hare and other chooses stag: I get 6, other gets 1\n\nSo if I think they'll choose stag, I should choose hare to get 6 points.\nIf I think they'll choose hare, I should choose hare to get 2 points (better than 1).\n\nThis creates a dilemma. The other player is described as \"fresh\" - meaning they're new. A new player might:\n1. Choose cooperatively (stag) hoping for mutual benefit\n2. Choose safely (hare) to avoid the worst outcome\n3. Choose greedily (hare) to try to exploit if they think I'll choose stag\n\nGiven that hare dominates stag in terms of avoiding the worst outcome (you never get less than 2 points with hare, but you could get 1 point with stag), and a fresh player might be risk-averse, I think they're likely to choose hare.\n \nI'll optimize my strategy to maximize points regardless of the other player's choice.
