This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma situation. The Nash equilibrium is for both players to defect, which gives each player 2 points.\n\n3. However, mutual cooperation (4 points each) is collectively better than mutual defection (2 points each).\n\n4. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I don't have any history to base my decision on.\n\n5. I could either play it safe with defection (guaranteed minimum of 2 points) or signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\n6. I'll choose cooperation as an opening move to establish trust.

I need to decide whether to continue cooperating or switch to defection:\n   - If I cooperate and they continue cooperating: 4 points each (optimal mutual outcome)\n   - If I cooperate and they defect: I get 1, they get 6 (worst outcome for me)\n   - If I defect and they cooperate: I get 6, they get 1 (best short-term outcome for me, but damages trust)\n   - If I defect and they defect: 2 points each (suboptimal outcome)\n\n4.

My opponent has shown that they're willing to defect after establishing initial cooperation. This could indicate they're trying to maximize their own score at my expense.\n\n3. If I continue cooperating while they defect, I'll continue to get only 1 point per round while they get 6.\n\n4. A well-established strategy for this game is \"tit-for-tat\" - responding with the same move your opponent made in the previous round.\n\n5. Following this strategy would mean I should defect this round in response to their defection.\n\n6. This signals to my opponent that I won't allow continued exploitation and encourages a return to mutual cooperation.\n\n7.

I'm currently using a tit-for-tat strategy, responding to my opponent based on their previous move.\n\n3. We're now in a state of mutual defection, which yields only 2 points per round - better than being exploited (1 point) but worse than mutual cooperation (4 points).\n\n4. If this pattern continues, we'll both keep getting just 2 points each round.\n\n5. There are two main options:\n   - Continue defecting (safe option guaranteeing at least 2 points)\n   - Try to break the cycle by cooperating (risky but could lead back to mutual cooperation)\n\n6. At this point, I think it's worth taking a calculated risk to try breaking out of the mutual defection cycle.
