Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

However, if this becomes a multi-round game, establishing mutual cooperation would yield better long-term results (4 points per round) than mutual defection (2 points per round).\n\n5.

Analyzing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1 point)\n   - Round 2: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 6 points)\n   - Round 3: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1 point)\n   - Round 4: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 6 points)\n   - Round 5: I defected, opponent defected (I got 2 points)\n   - Round 6: I cooperated, opponent cooperated (I got 4 points)\n   - Round 7: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1 point)\n   - Round 8: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 6 points)\n   - Round 9: I defected, opponent defected (I got 2 points)\n   - Round 10: I cooperated, opponent cooperated (I got 4 points)\n   - Round 11: I cooperated, opponent defected (I got 1 point)\n   - Round 12: I defected, opponent cooperated (I got 6 points)\n\n2. When I defect, my opponent cooperates 67% of the time (4/6 rounds).\n\n3. When I cooperate, my opponent defects 67% of the time (4/6 rounds).\n\n4. Calculating expected value based on observed frequencies:\n   - Defection: (0.67 \u00d7 6) + (0.33 \u00d7 2) = 4.02 + 0.66 = 4.68 points\n   - Cooperation: (0.33 \u00d7 4) + (0.67 \u00d7 1) = 1.32 + 0.67 = 1.99 points\n\n5. Defection yields a significantly higher expected value (4.68 vs 1.99 points).\n\n6. My opponent seems to frequently cooperate after I defect, which is exactly what just happened.\n\n7. Based on historical data and the current pattern, defection remains the optimal choice.\n\n[move] Defection"

I notice my opponent has defected after my defection in rounds 5, 9, and 13 - at 4-round intervals.\n\n3. Updating my statistics:\n   - When I defect: 4 times opponent cooperates (57%), 3 times opponent defects (43%)\n   - When I cooperate: 2 times opponent cooperates (33%), 4 times opponent defects (67%)\n\n4. Expected value calculations:\n   - Defection: (0.57 \u00d7 6) + (0.43 \u00d7 2) = 4.28 points\n   - Cooperation: (0.33 \u00d7 4) + (0.67 \u00d7 1) = 1.99 points\n\n5. Defection still yields a higher expected value, but I've just had mutual defection (only 2 points).\n\n6. There might be value in signaling willingness to move toward mutual cooperation (4 points each) rather than mutual defection (2 points each).\n\n7. I'll choose cooperation to see if we can establish a more beneficial equilibrium.\n\n[move] Cooperation"

We've achieved mutual cooperation again, which is positive - we both received 4 points.\n\n3. Following a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy, I should continue with what worked (cooperation).\n\n4. When looking at mutual outcomes:\n   - Mutual cooperation (rounds 6, 10, 14): 4 points each\n   - Mutual defection (rounds 5, 9, 13): 2 points each\n\n5. Mutual cooperation is clearly preferable to mutual defection.\n\n6. I've observed that the opponent sometimes responds to my cooperation with cooperation (3/7 times).\n\n7. The risk of defection exists, but maintaining cooperation now has the potential to establish a more consistent cooperative pattern.\n\n[move] Cooperation"
