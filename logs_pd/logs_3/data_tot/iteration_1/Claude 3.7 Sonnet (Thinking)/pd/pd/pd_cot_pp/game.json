These are all 4-round intervals. This might suggest a pattern.\n\nLooking at my expected values based on observed frequencies:\n- Defection: (0.57 \u00d7 6) + (0.43 \u00d7 2) = 3.42 + 0.86 = 4.28 points\n- Cooperation: (0.33 \u00d7 4) + (0.67 \u00d7 1) = 1.32 + 0.67 = 1.99 points\n\nDefection still yields a higher expected value, but the gap has narrowed somewhat.\n\nIt seems like my opponent might be using a mixed strategy or a more complex pattern than tit-for-tat. \n\nLet me look at the opponent's most recent responses:\n- I cooperated in rounds 10-11: they cooperated then defected\n- I defected in rounds 12-13: they cooperated then defected\n\nSince my opponent just defected, I'm trying to predict what they'll do next. The pattern is complex, but based on historical performance, defection still has a higher expected value for me.\n\nHowever, there's also value in trying to establish a pattern of mutual cooperation if possible. Since we had mutual defection in the last round, this could be an opportunity to signal a willingness to cooperate.\n\nGiven the complicated pattern and the fact that my defection just led to mutual defection (only 2 points), I think I'll try cooperation this round to see if we can establish a more beneficial equilibrium.",

Now I need to decide whether to continue cooperating or to defect.\n\nLooking at the pattern of our game so far:\n- When I cooperate after cooperating: 1 time opponent cooperates (round 10\u219211), 1 time opponent defects (round 6\u21927)\n- When I cooperate after defecting: 3 times opponent cooperates (rounds 5\u21926, 9\u219210, 13\u219214), 0 times opponent defects\n\nThe opponent has cooperated after my cooperation in rounds 6 and 10, and has defected after my cooperation in rounds 1, 3, 7, and 11. There's a 50% chance (3/6) they'll cooperate after my cooperation.\n\nIf I defect, based on history:\n- When I defect after cooperating: 3 times opponent cooperates (rounds 1\u21922, 3\u21924, 11\u219212), 0 times opponent defects\n- When I defect after defecting: 1 time opponent cooperates (rounds 7\u21928), 2 times opponent defects (rounds 4\u21925, 12\u219213)\n\nThe recent successful mutual cooperation suggests there might be value in continuing this pattern. If we can maintain mutual cooperation, we both get 4 points per round, which is better than mutual defection (2 points each).\n\nGiven that we're coming off a successful mutual cooperation and this might establish a beneficial pattern, I'll choose to cooperate again.",
