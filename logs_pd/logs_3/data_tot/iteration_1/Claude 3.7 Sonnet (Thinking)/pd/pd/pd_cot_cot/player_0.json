Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma-style game where mutual cooperation (4,4) yields better total results than mutual defection (2,2).\n2. I'm playing against a fresh player, so I have no history to base my decision on.\n3. If I cooperate, I risk getting only 1 point if they defect, but enable the possibility of mutual cooperation (4,4).\n4. If I defect, I guarantee at least 2 points and possibly 6 points.\n5. Since this may be a repeated game, establishing cooperation early could be beneficial for long-term outcomes.\n6. Starting with cooperation signals willingness for mutual benefit and can set a positive tone.\n7. The risk of getting only 1 point is worth taking for the potential of establishing mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] cooperation"

Analyzing our complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-15: Both players have consistently chosen cooperation in every round\n   - Each of us has earned 4 points per round, totaling 60 points so far\n2. We've established a remarkably stable pattern of mutual cooperation through fifteen consecutive rounds.\n3. The other player has demonstrated perfect consistency in maintaining a cooperative strategy.\n4. I could defect for a one-time gain of 6 points instead of 4, but this would break fifteen rounds of established trust.\n5. Such a breach would almost certainly trigger defection from the other player in future rounds.\n6. If we shift to mutual defection, our earnings would decrease from 4 points to just 2 points per round.\n7. Comparing outcomes over just three rounds:\n   - Continued cooperation: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 points\n   - Defection followed by mutual defection: 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 points\n8. Since there's no indication the game is ending soon, maintaining our successful cooperative relationship remains the optimal strategy.\n\n[move] cooperation"
