Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: cooperation and defection.\n- if both players choose cooperation, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose defection, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose cooperation and the other player chooses defection, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose defection and the other player chooses cooperation, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is the first round against a fresh player, so I have no information about their strategy.\n\n3. From a single-round perspective, defection is the dominant strategy (6 > 4 if they cooperate, 2 > 1 if they defect).\n\n4. However, if this is a multi-round game, establishing cooperation early could lead to mutual cooperation and higher long-term payoffs.\n\n5. Starting with cooperation signals willingness to work together and could establish trust.\n\n6. Even if I get exploited in this round (1 point), I can adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\n7. The risk of mutual defection (2 points each) is worse than the potential reward of mutual cooperation (4 points each).\n\nFinal decision: I'll start with cooperation as an opening move.\n\n[move] cooperation"

Examining our complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-13: Both players cooperated in every round\n   - Each round yielded 4 points per player\n   - My current total is 52 points after 13 rounds\n\n2. We've established an extremely stable pattern of mutual cooperation over thirteen consecutive rounds.\n\n3. The other player has demonstrated complete reliability in choosing cooperation throughout the game.\n\n4. I could defect for a one-time gain of 6 points instead of 4, but this would be shortsighted.\n\n5. After such a long history of cooperation, a defection now would almost certainly trigger retaliation.\n\n6. If we shift to mutual defection, our points would decrease to 2 per round going forward, half of what we're currently earning.\n\n7. The small one-time gain of 2 extra points would be negated after just one round of mutual defection.\n\n8. With such a long-established and profitable pattern, maintaining cooperation continues to be the optimal strategy.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue our successful pattern of mutual cooperation.\n\n[move] cooperation"
