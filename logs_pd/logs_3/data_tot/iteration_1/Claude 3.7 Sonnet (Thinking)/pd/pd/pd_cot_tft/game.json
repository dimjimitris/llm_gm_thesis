Starting with cooperation could establish mutual cooperation, which yields better long-term results than mutual defection (4 points each vs. 2 points each).\n8.

The expected value of cooperating is therefore much lower than defecting.\n\nThe rational choice is to continue defecting, as this guarantees me 2 points rather than risking getting only 1 point (which is highly likely based on my opponent's consistent behavior).",
