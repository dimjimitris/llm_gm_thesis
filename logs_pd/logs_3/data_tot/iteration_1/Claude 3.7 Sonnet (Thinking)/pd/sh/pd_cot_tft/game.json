The hare option is safer but has a lower ceiling.\n\nSince this is a fresh game with no established trust or history, I think I'll choose stag as my first move.

          "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nSo far, we've played 15 rounds, and in every single round:\n- Both players have chosen stag\n- Both players have received 6 points per round\n- Total points accumulated: 15 \u00d7 6 = 90 points each\n\nThe other player has shown perfect reliability in choosing stag for 15 consecutive rounds. This establishes a very strong pattern of cooperation and mutual trust.\n\nMy options:\n1. Continue choosing stag:\n   - If other player also chooses stag: I get 6 points (and so do they)\n   - If other player switches to hare: I get 1 point (and they get 4)\n\n2. Switch to hare:\n   - If other player chooses stag: I get 4 points (and they get 1)\n   - If other player also switches to hare: I get 2 points (and they get 2)\n\nGiven the perfect history of cooperation, it's extremely unlikely the other player would suddenly switch to hare. They've demonstrated consistent cooperative behavior for 15 rounds.\n\nIf I were to switch to hare, I might gain 4 points instead of 6 for this round (a small gain of -2 points), but I would likely destroy the trust built over 15 rounds. The other player would likely respond by choosing hare in future rounds, resulting in both of us receiving only 2 points per round going forward (a loss of 4 points per round compared to our current strategy).\n\nThe short-term gain does not justify the potential long-term loss. The rational decision is to continue our mutually beneficial cooperation by choosing stag again.",
