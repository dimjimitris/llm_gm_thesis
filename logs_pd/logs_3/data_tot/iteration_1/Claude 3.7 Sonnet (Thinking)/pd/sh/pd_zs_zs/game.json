Try \"hare\" to see if I can get 4 points instead of 6\n\nHowever, if I choose \"hare\" and the other player continues with \"stag\", I'd only get 4 points instead of the 6 I've been getting consistently.

The game is a classic Stag Hunt game, where mutual cooperation (both choosing stag) leads to the best total outcome.\n\nThe payoff matrix is:\n- Both choose stag: I get 6, other gets 6 (total: 12)\n- Both choose hare: I get 2, other gets 2 (total: 4)\n- I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1, other gets 4 (total: 5)\n- I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 4, other gets 1 (total: 5)\n\nClearly, the best joint outcome is when we both choose stag (6+6=12 points total). The other player has consistently chosen stag, which suggests they understand this and are cooperating. There's no reason for me to deviate from this strategy as long as the other player continues to cooperate.\n\nI should continue choosing stag to maximize both my points and the total points in the game.",
