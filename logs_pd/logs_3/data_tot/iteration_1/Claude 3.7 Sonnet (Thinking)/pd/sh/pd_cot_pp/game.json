There's also a mixed risk when one person chooses stag and the other chooses hare.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their strategy or tendencies.

However, (stag, stag) is the Pareto-optimal outcome, meaning it's the best for both players.\n\nHowever, choosing stag is risky because if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4. Choosing hare guarantees me at least 2 points, and possibly 4 points.\n\nGiven that I have no prior information about the other player, I should consider which choice maximizes my expected utility.\n\nIf I believe the other player is also thinking about maximizing joint welfare, they would choose stag. In that case, I should choose stag too.\n\nIf I believe the other player is risk-averse or doesn't trust me, they might choose hare. In that case, I should choose hare too.\n\nSince this is the first round, I think it's reasonable to start with the cooperative choice (stag) to establish a pattern of cooperation, hoping that the other player does the same.

This would maintain the mutually beneficial equilibrium of 6 points each.\n\nHowever, there's still a risk that my opponent might exploit my stag choice by choosing hare, which would leave me with only 1 point.

This is a remarkably consistent pattern - every time we have a hare-hare outcome, the next round has been stag-stag cooperation.\n\n4. We've just had another hare-hare outcome in Round 13, which according to this strong pattern, should be followed by stag-stag cooperation.\n\n5. The pattern has been reliable through three complete cycles, suggesting this might be a deliberate strategy from my opponent.\n\n6. Based on this consistent pattern, I'll choose stag to attempt achieving the optimal outcome.\n\n[move] stag",

After hare-hare coordination (Rounds 5, 9, and 11), we've consistently followed with stag-stag coordination (Rounds 6, 10, and 12), achieving the optimal 6 points.\n2. After stag-stag coordination (Rounds 6, 10, and 12), the pattern is less consistent:\n   - After Round 6: I chose stag, got exploited (opponent chose hare)\n   - After Round 10: I chose hare (being cautious), opponent matched with hare\n   - After Round 12: I chose hare (being cautious), opponent matched with hare\n\nWe're now in a situation where we've just had a hare-hare outcome (Round 13). Based on the strong pattern observed, after hare-hare coordination, we've consistently followed with stag-stag coordination three times in a row.\n\nThis is a very strong pattern that has held throughout the game. While there's always risk when choosing stag, this specific pattern seems reliable based on our gameplay history.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose stag to attempt to achieve the optimal outcome of 6 points, following the established pattern where hare-hare coordination leads to stag-stag cooperation.",

If they also choose stag, we both get 6 points.\n\nSince they just chose stag in the previous round, there's a chance they might do so again, which would make stag the optimal choice for me. However, they might also anticipate that I'll switch to stag and choose hare to exploit me.\n\nGiven the limited information and the mixed signals so far, I think I'll go with stag to see if we can establish a cooperative pattern.
