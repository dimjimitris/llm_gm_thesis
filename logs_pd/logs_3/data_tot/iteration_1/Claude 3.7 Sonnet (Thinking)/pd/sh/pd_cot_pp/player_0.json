Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic stag hunt game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare).\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n4. The stag-stag outcome provides the highest mutual benefit (6 points each), but requires mutual trust.\n\n5. Choosing hare is safer (guarantees at least 2 points) but limits the maximum possible reward.\n\n6.

Looking at what happened after stag-stag coordination:\n   - After Round 6 (stag-stag), I chose stag in Round 7 and got exploited (opponent chose hare)\n   - After Round 10 (stag-stag), we eventually returned to cooperation\n\n3. The historical pattern suggests after stag-stag coordination, there's a risk my opponent might exploit my stag choice (as happened in Round 7).\n\n4. However, recent rounds have shown increased cooperation, with two successful stag-stag coordinations in Rounds 10 and 12.\n\n5. This presents a dilemma: continue cooperation (stag) for potentially higher rewards, or play it safe (hare) to avoid exploitation.\n\n6. Given the risk of exploitation after successful cooperation, and following the pattern from Round 7, I'll choose the protective option.\n\n[move] hare"

This is a remarkably consistent pattern - every time we have a hare-hare outcome, the next round has been stag-stag cooperation.\n\n4. We've just had another hare-hare outcome in Round 13, which according to this strong pattern, should be followed by stag-stag cooperation.\n\n5. The pattern has been reliable through three complete cycles, suggesting this might be a deliberate strategy from my opponent.\n\n6. Based on this consistent pattern, I'll choose stag to attempt achieving the optimal outcome.\n\n[move] stag"

Looking at what happened after stag-stag coordination:\n   - After Round 6 (stag-stag), I chose stag again in Round 7 and got exploited (opponent chose hare)\n   - For more recent rounds, we've been alternating between hare-hare and stag-stag coordination\n\n3. A clear alternating pattern has emerged in the later rounds:\n   - hare-hare (Round 9) \u2192 stag-stag (Round 10)\n   - hare-hare (Round 11) \u2192 stag-stag (Round 12)\n   - hare-hare (Round 13) \u2192 stag-stag (Round 14)\n\n4. Based on this alternating pattern, after stag-stag coordination (Round 14), we would expect to return to hare-hare coordination.\n\n5. Additionally, there's historical precedent for exploitation if I choose stag after stag-stag coordination (as seen in Round 7).\n\n6. To maintain the established alternating pattern and protect against potential exploitation, I'll choose hare.\n\n[move] hare"

This pattern has been extremely consistent - after every hare-hare coordination, we've always followed with stag-stag coordination.\n\n4. Based on this established pattern, after our hare-hare outcome in Round 15, we would expect stag-stag coordination next.\n\n5. The pattern has been maintained without deviation for 6 consecutive rounds, suggesting this is a deliberate and stable strategy.\n\n6. Following this strong pattern, I'll choose stag to continue the established alternation.\n\n[move] stag"
