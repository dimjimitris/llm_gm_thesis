Score: 4\n\nIt seems like when I choose stag, the opponent usually chooses hare (5 out of 7 times), which means I get a low payoff of 1. When I choose hare, the opponent usually chooses stag (5 out of 7 times), which means I get a high payoff of 4.\n\nBased on this pattern, it seems like choosing hare is generally more profitable for me, as it gives me an average score of about 3.43 points per round, whereas choosing stag gives me an average score of about 2.43 points per round.\n\nThe opponent seems to be exploiting me when I choose stag and cooperating when I choose hare. This suggests that continuing with hare might be the most profitable strategy for me.\n\nI've just chosen hare and got 4 points, which is consistent with the pattern. I think I'll continue with hare to maximize my expected points.",
