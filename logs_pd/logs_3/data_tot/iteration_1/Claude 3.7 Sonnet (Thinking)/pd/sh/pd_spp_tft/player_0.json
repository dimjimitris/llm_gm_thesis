    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me collaborate with some expert personas to choose my move wisely.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Strategic Planner, Decision Analyst\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic stag hunt game. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Both choose stag: (6, 6) - best collective outcome\n- Both choose hare: (2, 2) - safe but suboptimal\n- You choose stag, opponent chooses hare: (1, 4) - worst outcome for you\n- You choose hare, opponent chooses stag: (4, 1) - best individual outcome for you\n\nStrategic Planner: For the first move against a fresh player, we need to consider what a rational opponent might do. The stag choice offers higher potential reward but carries risk. The hare choice is safer but limits our upside.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's calculate expected values assuming a random opponent:\n- If you choose stag: 0.5 \u00d7 6 + 0.5 \u00d7 1 = 3.5 points expected\n- If you choose hare: 0.5 \u00d7 4 + 0.5 \u00d7 2 = 3 points expected\nBy expected value alone, stag is slightly better.\n\nGame Theorist: In first encounters, players often attempt cooperation hoping for mutual benefit. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend choosing stag. It offers the highest potential reward and establishes a precedent for cooperation if this turns out to be a repeated game.\n\n[move] stag"

This suggests they're playing non-cooperatively or maximizing short-term gain.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this information, we should adapt our strategy. Continuing with stag would leave us vulnerable to exploitation. In repeated games, it's important to signal that we won't continually accept the worst outcome.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's analyze the expected values now:\n- If opponent continues choosing hare: stag gives us 1 point, hare gives us 2 points\n- If opponent switches to stag: stag gives us 6 points, hare gives us 4 points\n- Based on their first move, there's a higher probability they'll continue with hare\n- Therefore, hare is the safer and likely more profitable choice\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. In game theory, we often need to respond to non-cooperation with a similar strategy until the other player shows willingness to cooperate.\n\nStrategic Planner: Choosing hare protects us from the worst outcome while potentially teaching the opponent that mutual cooperation would be more beneficial in future rounds.\n\n[move] hare"

In the first round, you chose stag and opponent chose hare. In the second round, you chose hare and opponent chose stag. This pattern suggests they might be using an alternating strategy or reacting to your previous move.\n\nStrategic Planner: There are several possibilities to consider:\n1) They might be using a simple alternating strategy (hare-stag-hare)\n2) They might be trying to establish a pattern where both players alternate (giving an average of 2.5 points per round)\n3) They might be adapting based on what you just played\n\nDecision Analyst: If they're alternating regardless of your moves, they'll choose hare this round. If they're adapting to counter your moves, they might expect you to choose stag this round.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that mutual stag cooperation (6,6) is optimal for both players, we should try to establish that equilibrium. Choosing stag now signals willingness to cooperate despite past results.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. If we choose stag and they choose stag, we both get 6 points. This would be a clear signal that cooperation is beneficial. Even if they choose hare again, the information gained would be valuable for future rounds.\n\n[move] stag"

The worst outcome with hare (2 points) is better than the historically consistent outcome with stag (1 point).\n\nStrategic Planner: With zero evidence of cooperation from this opponent, and a clear mathematical advantage to choosing hare, I recommend continuing with the hare strategy.\n\n[move] hare"
