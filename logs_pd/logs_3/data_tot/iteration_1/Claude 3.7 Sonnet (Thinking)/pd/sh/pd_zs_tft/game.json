This is a very strong pattern that suggests they're likely to continue with hare. When I've chosen stag (twice), I've been exploited and received only 1 point each time. When I've chosen hare, I've received either 2 points (when they also chose hare) or 4 points (when they chose stag).\n\nGiven this history, choosing hare remains the safer and more rational choice. It guarantees me at least 2 points, whereas choosing stag could result in just 1 point if my opponent continues their pattern of choosing hare.\n\nThe mutual stag outcome (6 points each) would be ideal, but there's no evidence my opponent is willing to cooperate in that direction. After trying stag twice and being exploited both times, I have no reason to believe they'll suddenly switch to stag now after seven consecutive hare choices.\n\nI will continue with hare.",
