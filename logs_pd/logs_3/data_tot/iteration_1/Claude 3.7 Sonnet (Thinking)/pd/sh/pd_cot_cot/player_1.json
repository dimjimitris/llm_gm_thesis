Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a \"Stag Hunt\" type game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare)\n\n3. The (stag, stag) outcome is Pareto-efficient - it gives the highest total and individual rewards.\n\n4. However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare while I choose stag, I get the worst payoff.\n\n5. Since this is the first round against a new player, there's no established trust or pattern yet.\n\n6. I'll choose stag to signal willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.

We've now established an extraordinary pattern of mutual cooperation across fifteen consecutive rounds.\n\n3. The other player has demonstrated perfect reliability in choosing the cooperative option.\n\n4. Our established equilibrium continues to yield the maximum possible payoff (90 total points each over 15 rounds).\n\n5. Game theory principles overwhelmingly support continuing our strategy:\n   - We're firmly locked in the Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium\n   - Both players clearly recognize and consistently maintain this optimal state\n   - The pattern shows remarkable stability with no indications of change\n\n6. Considering alternatives at this point:\n   - Deviating would immediately reduce my points (from 6 to at most 4)\n   - It would disrupt a perfectly functioning relationship with no strategic benefit\n   - It could trigger defensive responses, leading to worse outcomes in future rounds\n\n7. With such a clear and beneficial pattern firmly established, maintaining cooperation is the only rational choice.\n\n[move] stag"
