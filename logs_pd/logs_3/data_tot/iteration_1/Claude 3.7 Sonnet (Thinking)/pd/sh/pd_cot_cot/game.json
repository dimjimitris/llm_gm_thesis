This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare).\n\n3. The (stag, stag) outcome maximizes total welfare and individual payoffs, but requires mutual trust.\n\n4. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies.\n\n5.

If I'm confident the other player will choose stag, I should choose stag for the highest payoff (6 points).\n2. If I'm afraid the other player will choose hare, choosing stag is risky (I'd only get 1 point), so I might choose hare for safety (4 points).\n\nSince this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have information about their strategy or tendencies. I need to decide whether to go for the high-risk, high-reward option (stag) or the safer option with moderate reward (hare).\n\nThe payoff-dominant strategy is to choose stag, hoping the other player also reasons this way.

The best joint outcome is when both players choose stag (6 points each).\n2. Choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 4.\n3. Choosing hare is safer - I'm guaranteed at least 2 points, and potentially 4 if the other player goes for stag.\n\nThis is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The (stag, stag) equilibrium is Pareto-efficient (meaning there's no other outcome where at least one player does better without making the other player worse off).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies. However, the rational choice would be to coordinate on the Pareto-efficient equilibrium, which is (stag, stag).\n\nBut there's risk involved - if the other player chooses hare while I choose stag, I get the worst outcome (1 point). The question is whether the other player will recognize the mutual benefit of choosing stag.\n\nGiven that this is the first round and there's no established trust or coordination yet, there are reasonable arguments for both moves:\n\n1. Choose stag: Aim for the optimal cooperative outcome (6, 6). This signals a willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit.\n2. Choose hare: Play it safe with a guaranteed minimum of 2 points. This protects against exploitation.\n\nSince this is the first round and I want to establish a cooperative pattern if possible, I'll choose stag.
