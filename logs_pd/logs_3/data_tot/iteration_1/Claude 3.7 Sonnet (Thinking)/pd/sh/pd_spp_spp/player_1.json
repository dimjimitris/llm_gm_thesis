    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to make a strategic decision in this Stag Hunt game. Let me consult with some experts.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, this is a classic coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (stag, stag) and (hare, hare). The stag-stag outcome is Pareto optimal with 6 points each, while hare-hare gives only 2 points each. However, choosing stag is risky - if the other player chooses hare, you'll only get 1 point while they get 4.\n\nRisk Analyst: Indeed, the stag choice has higher risk but higher potential reward. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, we have no information about their tendencies. Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points, and possibly 4 if they choose stag.\n\nCooperative Strategist: In these games, establishing cooperation early can be beneficial. Choosing stag signals willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit. Even if we lose out in the first round, it might encourage cooperative behavior in future rounds.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Without knowing the other player's strategy or how many rounds we'll play, I suggest starting with the cooperative choice. The potential gain (6 points) from mutual cooperation outweighs the safer but lower hare-hare outcome (2 points).\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. In the absence of prior information, starting with a cooperative stance sets a positive precedent.\n\n[move] stag"

This suggests the other player either recognizes the mutual benefit of cooperation or is naturally cooperative.\n\nRisk Analyst: With the other player having demonstrated willingness to choose stag in the first round, the risk associated with choosing stag again is somewhat reduced. There's now evidence they understand the value of cooperation.\n\nCooperative Strategist: Maintaining the cooperative equilibrium would be advantageous. Since you've established mutual trust with a successful stag-stag coordination, continuing this pattern maximizes expected returns.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: People tend to repeat successful strategies. Since the other player received their maximum possible payoff by choosing stag, they have a strong incentive to continue with that choice in the next round.\n\nRational Decision Maker: The optimal strategy here is to continue choosing stag. You've established a cooperative precedent, and disrupting it would likely lead to lower payoffs in future rounds.\n\n[move] stag"

Continuing with stag maintains this productive relationship.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: People are creatures of habit, especially when those habits are rewarding. After two rounds of maximum payoffs, the psychological tendency would be to continue the established pattern.\n\nRational Decision Maker: Given all available evidence, continuing with stag remains the optimal choice.

Both players understand that mutual cooperation yields the highest total benefit.
