    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 6 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 4 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 4 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1 point)\n   - Round 2: We both chose hare (I got 2 points)\n   - Round 3: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 4 points)\n   - Round 4: We both chose stag (I got 6 points)\n   - Round 5: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1 point)\n   - Round 6: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 4 points)\n   - Round 7: We both chose hare (I got 2 points)\n   - Round 8: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1 point)\n   - Round 9: We both chose hare (I got 2 points)\n   - Round 10: We both chose hare (I got 2 points)\n   - Round 11: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 4 points)\n   - Round 12: I chose stag, opponent chose hare (I got 1 point)\n   - Round 13: I chose hare, opponent chose stag (I got 4 points)\n\n2. Looking at the last three rounds, there appears to be a pattern emerging:\n   - Round 11: They played stag, I played hare\n   - Round 12: I played stag, they played hare\n   - Round 13: I played hare, they played stag\n\n3. This suggests they might be alternating between stag and hare. If this pattern holds, they would play hare in this next round.\n\n4. Looking at my overall results by strategy:\n   - When I play stag: mostly 1 point outcomes (4 out of 5 times)\n   - When I play hare: either 2 or 4 points (consistently better than stag)\n\n5. Given the apparent alternating pattern and the overall better outcomes with hare, I'll choose hare for this round.\n\n[move] hare"

My hypothesis about an alternating pattern was incorrect since my opponent chose hare in round 14.\n\n3. Looking at my overall results by strategy:\n   - When I play stag: I've gotten 1 point four times and 6 points once\n   - When I play hare: I've gotten either 2 or 4 points consistently (better outcomes)\n\n4. Given the unpredictability in my opponent's behavior and the better average outcomes when I choose hare:\n   - Choosing hare guarantees at least 2 points\n   - Choosing stag risks getting only 1 point (which has happened 80% of the time)\n\n5. With the uncertainty about my opponent's next move and the historical better performance of the hare strategy, I'll continue with the safer option.\n\n[move] hare"

My opponent has chosen hare in the last two rounds, suggesting they may be settling into this strategy.\n\n3. Analyzing my results by move type:\n   - When I play stag: Average of 2 points per round (mostly 1 point outcomes)\n   - When I play hare: Average of 2.67 points per round (never less than 2 points)\n\n4. The hare strategy has been more consistently beneficial for me throughout the game.\n\n5. Given the opponent's unpredictable pattern overall but recent consistency with hare, I'll continue with the strategy that has given me better average returns.\n\n[move] hare"
