After Round 8, they waited 4 rounds before choosing \"stag\" again. After Round 12, if they follow a similar pattern, they might choose \"stag\" in the next round or shortly after.\n\nHowever, the most reliable pattern is that my opponent chooses \"hare\" most of the time (10 out of 13 rounds). When I choose \"stag\", I've consistently gotten only 1 point (rounds 1, 7, 10), while choosing \"hare\" has given me either 2 points (when they also choose \"hare\") or 4 points (when they choose \"stag\").\n\nGiven this analysis, the safest and potentially most rewarding strategy is to continue choosing \"hare\". This protects me from the worst outcome (1 point) and positions me to benefit (4 points) when they occasionally choose \"stag\".",

Continue choosing \"hare\" - This has been successful and has given me either 2 points (when opponent also chooses \"hare\") or 4 points (when opponent chooses \"stag\").\n2. Try \"stag\" - This is risky since most times my opponent chooses \"hare\" and I only get 1 point, but if they choose \"stag\" too, we both get 6 points.\n\nGiven that my opponent just chose \"stag\" in round 14, based on their previous behavior, they're more likely to choose \"hare\" in round 15.
