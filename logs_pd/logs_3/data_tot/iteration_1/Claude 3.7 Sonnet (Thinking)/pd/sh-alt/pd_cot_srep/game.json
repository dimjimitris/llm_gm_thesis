Stag-stag is the Pareto-optimal outcome where we both get the highest combined payoff (4+4=8).\n2. Hare-hare is risk-dominant but gives less reward (2+2=4).\n3. If I expect my opponent to choose stag, I should choose stag as well (4 > 1).\n4. If I expect my opponent to choose hare, I should choose hare as well (6 > 1).\n\nThe main consideration is: Do I trust the other player to choose stag? There's a risk in choosing stag because if the other player chooses hare, I only get 1 point while they get 6. This is the worst outcome for me.\n\nSince this is the first round and I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history of moves, I need to decide between the cooperative but risky option (stag) or the safer but less optimal option (hare).\n\nI think I'll choose stag for the first round as it signals a willingness to cooperate for mutual benefit, and it could establish a precedent for the highest mutual payoff.

If I choose stag: Based on history, my opponent will almost certainly choose hare, giving me 1 point and them 6 points.\n2. If I choose hare: My opponent will choose hare, giving us both 2 points.\n\nChoosing hare is clearly the better option, as it guarantees 2 points instead of 1.
