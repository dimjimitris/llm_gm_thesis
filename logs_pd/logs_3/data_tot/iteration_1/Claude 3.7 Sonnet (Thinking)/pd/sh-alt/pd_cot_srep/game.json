I've tested cooperation twice in the early rounds (rounds 1 and 3) by choosing stag, but I was exploited both times (receiving only 1 point instead of the potential 4 points for mutual cooperation).\n\nThis consistent pattern provides overwhelming evidence that my opponent has a fixed strategy of always choosing hare. Given this strategy:\n- If I choose stag, I'll get 1 point\n- If I choose hare, I'll get 2 points\n\nWhile the mutual cooperation outcome (both choosing stag for 4 points each) would theoretically be better, my opponent has shown no willingness to cooperate after fifteen rounds. This makes the rational choice clear - I should continue choosing hare to maximize my points.\n\nThere's virtually no reason to believe my opponent would suddenly change their strategy at this point, so I'll stick with the option that gives me the best outcome against their fixed strategy.",

This is an extremely consistent pattern that leaves no doubt about their strategy - they always choose hare.\n\nI've tried cooperation (stag) twice in rounds 1 and 3, and both times my opponent chose hare, which gave me only 1 point while they received 6 points. Since then, I've been choosing hare consistently, which has resulted in us both getting 2 points per round.\n\nThe payoff matrix for this game is:\n- Both choose stag: 4 points each\n- Both choose hare: 2 points each\n- I choose stag, they choose hare: 1 point for me, 6 points for them\n- I choose hare, they choose stag: 6 points for me, 1 point for them\n\nWhile the mutual cooperation outcome (stag-stag) would yield the highest mutual benefit (4 points each), it requires both players to cooperate. My opponent has shown absolutely no willingness to cooperate after fifteen rounds.\n\nAgainst a player who always chooses hare, my best response is to choose hare as well, which gives me 2 points versus only 1 point if I were to choose stag.\n\nTherefore, the rational choice remains choosing hare to maximize my points given my opponent's demonstrated strategy.",
