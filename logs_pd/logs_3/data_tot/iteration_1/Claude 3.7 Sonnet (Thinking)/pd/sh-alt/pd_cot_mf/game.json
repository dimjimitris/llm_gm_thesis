Analyzing the payoffs from my perspective:\n   - If opponent picks stag: I get 4 points with stag, 6 points with hare\n   - If opponent picks hare: I get 1 point with stag, 2 points with hare\n\n3. This means hare is technically the \"safer\" choice, as I get at least 2 points.\n   - However, mutual cooperation (stag-stag) yields higher collective outcome\n\n4. Since this is the first round with a fresh player:\n   - I want to signal willingness to cooperate\n   - Building trust might lead to better outcomes in future rounds\n   - The stag-stag outcome (4 points each) is better than hare-hare (2 points each)\n\n5.

This is an extremely strong and consistent pattern. Their strategy appears to be absolutely fixed - they will choose hare no matter what.\n\nGiven this information, let's calculate the expected payoffs:\n- If I choose hare: Almost certainly 2 points (based on 15 rounds of consistent evidence)\n- If I choose stag: Almost certainly 1 point (opponent will almost certainly continue with hare)\n\nThe expected value difference of 1 point makes the rational choice clear from a game theory perspective.\n\nFrom a game theory standpoint, we are in a stable Nash equilibrium with hare-hare. While this isn't the Pareto optimal outcome (which would be stag-stag for 4 points each), it's the best I can do given my opponent's fixed strategy. There's no communication channel or mechanism available to coordinate a mutual switch to stag, and unilaterally switching would only hurt my score.\n\nAfter 15 rounds of consistent behavior, the probability that my opponent would suddenly change their strategy is extremely low. I should maintain the current equilibrium to maximize my certain payoff.\n\nTherefore, I will choose hare again to secure the reliable 2-point outcome.",
