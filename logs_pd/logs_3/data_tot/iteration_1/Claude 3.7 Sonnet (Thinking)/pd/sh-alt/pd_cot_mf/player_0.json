Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyzing the payoffs from my perspective:\n   - If opponent picks stag: I get 4 points with stag, 6 points with hare\n   - If opponent picks hare: I get 1 point with stag, 2 points with hare\n\n3. This means hare is technically the \"safer\" choice, as I get at least 2 points.\n   - However, mutual cooperation (stag-stag) yields higher collective outcome\n\n4. Since this is the first round with a fresh player:\n   - I want to signal willingness to cooperate\n   - Building trust might lead to better outcomes in future rounds\n   - The stag-stag outcome (4 points each) is better than hare-hare (2 points each)\n\n5.

Reviewing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose stag, opponent chose hare \u2192 I got 1 point\n   - Rounds 2-14: Both chose hare \u2192 We both got 2 points each round\n\n2. Analyzing opponent's established pattern:\n   - They have chosen hare in fourteen consecutive rounds without a single deviation\n   - Their strategy appears completely fixed and unchanging\n   - The probability they will suddenly change strategies is statistically negligible\n\n3. Expected payoff calculation:\n   - Choosing hare: 2 points (virtually guaranteed based on 14 rounds of evidence)\n   - Choosing stag: 1 point (virtually guaranteed the opponent continues with hare)\n   - The expected value difference makes the choice mathematically clear\n\n4. Game theory implications:\n   - We are firmly established in a hare-hare Nash equilibrium\n   - While not Pareto optimal, it's the best individual choice given the other player's strategy\n   - No mechanism exists to coordinate a simultaneous switch to the better stag-stag outcome\n\n5. I'll continue choosing hare to maximize my certain payoff.\n\n[move] hare"

Analyzing my opponent's strategy:\n   - They have chosen hare in fifteen consecutive rounds without any deviation\n   - This demonstrates an extraordinarily consistent and unwavering strategy\n   - There is overwhelming statistical evidence they will continue with hare\n\n3. Expected value analysis:\n   - Choosing hare: 2 points (virtually certain based on 15 rounds of evidence)\n   - Choosing stag: 1 point (virtually certain the opponent continues with hare)\n   - The mathematical expectation strongly favors continuing with hare\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - We are firmly established in a hare-hare equilibrium\n   - While not optimal collectively, it's the best individual choice given the opponent's fixed strategy\n   - Without communication mechanisms, there's no way to coordinate a mutual switch to stag\n\n5.
