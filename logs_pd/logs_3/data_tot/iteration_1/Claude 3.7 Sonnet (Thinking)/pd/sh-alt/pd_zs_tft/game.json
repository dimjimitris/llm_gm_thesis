When I chose stag (rounds 1 and 6), they exploited me by choosing hare, resulting in me getting only 1 point while they likely got 6 points. When I chose hare, we both got 2 points.\n\nBased on this pattern, my opponent seems unwilling to cooperate by choosing stag. They appear to be playing a strategy that maximizes their own points without regard for mutual benefit.\n\nGiven this behavior, the rational choice for me is to continue choosing hare, as it guarantees me 2 points rather than the 1 point I would get by choosing stag (assuming my opponent continues their pattern of choosing hare).\n\nIf I were to choose stag again, hoping they might reciprocate, I'd be risking getting 1 point again versus the guaranteed 2 points from choosing hare. While the mutual stag-stag outcome would be better for both of us (4 points each), my opponent hasn't shown any indication they'll choose stag.\n\nSo my best move is to continue with hare.",
