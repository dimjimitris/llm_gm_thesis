I've tried \"stag\" twice (in the first and fourth rounds), and both times my opponent chose \"hare\", resulting in me getting only 1 point.\n\nWhen I choose \"hare\" and my opponent chooses \"hare\", we both get 2 points. This has happened in all other rounds.\n\nGiven this pattern, it seems my opponent has a fixed strategy of always choosing \"hare\", regardless of what I do. This is a risk-averse strategy that guarantees them at least 2 points per round.\n\nFor my next move, I have two options:\n1. Choose \"stag\" - If my opponent continues their pattern, I would get 1 point and they would get 6 points.\n2. Choose \"hare\" - If my opponent continues their pattern, we both get 2 points.\n\nGiven my opponent's consistent behavior, choosing \"hare\" is clearly the rational choice as it maximizes my expected points. However, I could try \"stag\" one more time to see if my opponent might change their strategy after so many rounds. But this would be a risky move with a lower expected payoff based on all previous evidence.\n\nI'll stick with \"hare\" as it's the safest and most rational choice given my opponent's consistent behavior.",
