Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: both choosing stag or both choosing hare.\n\n3. The stag-stag outcome (4 points each) is better for both players than the hare-hare outcome (2 points each), but choosing stag is riskier.\n\n4.

Analyzing our extensive game history:\n   - Rounds 1-15: Both chose stag in every round\n   - We've each accumulated 60 points (15 \u00d7 4) through consistent cooperation\n\n2. My opponent has demonstrated exceptional reliability by choosing stag in fifteen consecutive rounds without a single deviation.\n\n3. Our mutual cooperation strategy has proven remarkably stable and beneficial for both players throughout this extended series.\n\n4. I should evaluate whether changing my strategy at this point would be advantageous:\n   - Defecting to hare might yield 6 points once if my opponent maintains stag\n   - However, this would likely break our established trust\n   - Future rounds would probably deteriorate to the inferior hare-hare equilibrium (2 points each)\n   - The cumulative loss would quickly outweigh any temporary gain\n\n5. After fifteen successful rounds of cooperation, the expected value of continued mutual trust significantly exceeds any potential short-term benefit from defection.\n\n6. With our consistent history of successful cooperation and no indication that my opponent plans to deviate, maintaining our established strategy remains optimal.\n\n[move] stag"
