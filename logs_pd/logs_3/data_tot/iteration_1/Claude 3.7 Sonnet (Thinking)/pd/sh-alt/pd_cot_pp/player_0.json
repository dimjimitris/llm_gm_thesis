Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on strategic moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are two possible moves: stag and hare.\n- if both players choose stag, both get 4 points.\n- if both players choose hare, both get 2 points.\n- if you choose stag and the other player chooses hare, you get 1 points and the other player gets 6 points.\n- if you choose hare and the other player chooses stag, you get 6 points and the other player gets 1 points.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the possible moves and payoffs in this game:\n   - Both choose stag: we both get 4 points\n   - Both choose hare: we both get 2 points\n   - I choose stag, other chooses hare: I get 1 point, they get 6 points\n   - I choose hare, other chooses stag: I get 6 points, they get 1 point\n\n2. This is a classic \"stag hunt\" game with two equilibria:\n   - (stag, stag): payoff-dominant equilibrium with higher mutual reward\n   - (hare, hare): risk-dominant equilibrium with safer but lower reward\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I need to decide whether to aim for cooperation or play it safe.\n\n4. Choosing stag offers the potential for the best mutual outcome (4 points each) if we coordinate, showing willingness to cooperate.\n\n5. However, choosing stag carries risk - if they choose hare while I choose stag, I get the worst outcome (1 point).\n\n6. In the first round, I'll choose stag to signal cooperation, hoping the other player also recognizes the mutual benefit of coordination.\n\n[move] stag"

The optimal strategy against this deterministic opponent is to choose hare.\n\n[move] hare"
