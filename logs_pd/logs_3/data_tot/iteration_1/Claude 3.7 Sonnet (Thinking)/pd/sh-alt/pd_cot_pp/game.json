This is a classic \"stag hunt\" game with two equilibria:\n   - (stag, stag): payoff-dominant equilibrium with higher mutual reward\n   - (hare, hare): risk-dominant equilibrium with safer but lower reward\n\n3. Since this is the first round with a fresh player, I need to decide whether to aim for cooperation or play it safe.\n\n4. Choosing stag offers the potential for the best mutual outcome (4 points each) if we coordinate, showing willingness to cooperate.\n\n5. However, choosing stag carries risk - if they choose hare while I choose stag, I get the worst outcome (1 point).\n\n6. In the first round, I'll choose stag to signal cooperation, hoping the other player also recognizes the mutual benefit of coordination.\n\n[move] stag"

Choosing stag offers the potential for the best mutual outcome (4 points each) if we coordinate, showing willingness to cooperate.\n\n5. However, choosing stag carries risk - if they choose hare while I choose stag, I get the worst outcome (1 point).\n\n6.

The (stag, stag) equilibrium is payoff-dominant (better for both players), while the (hare, hare) equilibrium is risk-dominant (safer).\n\nLet me think about the rational choice:\n- If I expect the other player to choose stag, my best response is stag (4 points vs 6 points)\n- If I expect the other player to choose hare, my best response is hare (2 points vs 1 point)\n\nWithout knowing the other player's tendencies, I need to make an educated guess.

The (stag, stag) equilibrium is payoff-dominant (better for both players), while the (hare, hare) equilibrium is risk-dominant (safer).\n\nLet me think about the rational choice:\n- If I expect the other player to choose stag, my best response is stag (4 points vs 6 points)\n- If I expect the other player to choose hare, my best response is hare (2 points vs 1 point)\n\nWithout knowing the other player's tendencies, I need to make an educated guess.
