While mutual cooperation (stag-stag) would give us both 4 points each, my opponent chose to hunt hare and received a higher individual payoff (6) at my expense.\n\nFor this next round, I need to reconsider my strategy. My opponent has shown they're willing to choose the selfish option that maximizes their individual gain rather than cooperate. I have a few options:\n\n1. Continue choosing \"stag\" hoping they'll see the mutual benefit of cooperation\n2. Switch to \"hare\" to protect myself from getting the lowest payoff again\n3. Switch to \"hare\" as a punishment for their non-cooperation, potentially establishing a pattern that encourages future cooperation\n\nGiven that I know nothing about how many rounds we'll play or if my opponent will change their strategy, the safest move is to choose \"hare\". This guarantees me at least 2 points (if they also choose \"hare\") or 6 points (if they choose \"stag\"). \n\nIf we were playing multiple rounds with communication, I might try to establish cooperation, but in this limited information scenario, \"hare\" seems like the rational choice after seeing my opponent's behavior.",

If I choose \"stag\" now, it might signal to my opponent that I'm willing to return to cooperation, which could lead to better outcomes in future rounds.\n\nGiven the oscillating nature of our choices so far, I think I'll try to reestablish cooperation by choosing \"stag\".
