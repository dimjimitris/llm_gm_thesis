If I defect:\n   - If they cooperate, I get 4 points\n   - If they defect, I get 2 points\n\nFrom a purely self-interested perspective in a one-shot game, defection is the dominant strategy because:\n- 4 > 6 (when they cooperate)\n- 2 > 1 (when they defect)\n\nHowever, the hint mentions I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" which suggests this might be a repeated game where building trust could be beneficial.
