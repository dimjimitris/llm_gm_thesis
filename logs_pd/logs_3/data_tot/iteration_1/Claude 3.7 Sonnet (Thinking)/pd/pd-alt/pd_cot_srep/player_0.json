My opponent has shown an inconsistent strategy - they periodically cooperate (rounds 8 and 11) but then immediately return to defection. When I've attempted to reciprocate their cooperation (as in Round 9), they've exploited that cooperation.\n\nLooking at their behavior after cooperating, they've always defected in the subsequent round (Round 12 after cooperating in Round 11). This suggests their cooperative moves may be tactical rather than attempts to establish sustained mutual cooperation.\n\nWhile mutual cooperation would yield the best outcome (6 points each), their demonstrated pattern doesn't suggest they're committed to that path. The safest choice remains defection.\n\n[move] (Maintaining defensive strategy due to opponent's inconsistent cooperation pattern) defection"

This represents a potential turning point in the game.\n\nWhile there's still risk given their history of exploiting my cooperation attempts, their two consecutive cooperative moves suggest a possible change in strategy.
