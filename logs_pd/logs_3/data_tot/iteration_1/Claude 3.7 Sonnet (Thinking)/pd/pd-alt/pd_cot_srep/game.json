He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1.

If I defect again and they're genuinely trying to establish cooperation, we'll stay locked in a suboptimal pattern.\n\nIt might be worth testing cooperation now to see if we can re-establish mutual cooperation.
