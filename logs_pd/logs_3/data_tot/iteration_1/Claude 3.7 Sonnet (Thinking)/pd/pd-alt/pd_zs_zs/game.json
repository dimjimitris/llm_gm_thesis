If we had both defected every round, we would have only earned 2 points each per round, for a total of 30 points each over 15 rounds. If we had mixed strategies or one player had consistently defected while the other cooperated, the outcomes would have been even more imbalanced and likely lower in total.\n\nThe game demonstrates the power of mutual cooperation in repeated interactions - we've established trust and both benefited maximally from the game structure.
