This pattern has been extremely stable and beneficial for both players.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n\n1. History: After an initial round where my opponent defected while I cooperated, and a second round where I defected while they cooperated, we've settled into a stable pattern of mutual cooperation for 12 rounds.\n\n2. Points maximization: Mutual cooperation (6 points each) is clearly the best overall outcome in terms of total points earned compared to mutual defection (2 points each).\n\n3. Trust: We've built a strong foundation of trust over these 12 rounds.\n\n4. Risk: There's always the possibility that my opponent might defect to try to gain a short-term advantage (4 points instead of 6), but they haven't shown any indication of this strategy so far.\n\nGiven this analysis, continuing to cooperate is clearly the optimal strategy. It maintains our established equilibrium and continues to maximize my points in each round.",
