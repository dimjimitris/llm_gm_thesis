Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

They've now played scissors in 7 out of 10 rounds, showing an even stronger preference.\n5. After I won with rock, they played scissors again, and now after a tie with scissors, I need to predict their next move.\n6. My opponent seems to have a strong bias toward scissors regardless of outcomes.\n7. When I've played rock against their scissors, I've won both times (+1 each).\n8. Given their persistent preference for scissors even after losses, there's a high probability they'll play scissors again.\n9. However, at some point they must adapt to break this pattern, especially after so many scissors plays.\n10. If they finally adapt and play rock (to beat my expected scissors), I should play paper.\n11. If they continue with scissors, I should play rock.\n12. Given their strong historical bias toward scissors (70% of moves), rock still has the highest expected value.\n13. The risk of them finally changing their pattern exists, but their demonstrated behavior suggests scissors remains their most likely move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on my opponent's strong historical preference for scissors (7/10 rounds) and their reluctance to change this pattern even after losses, I'll play rock again, which has proven successful against their scissors in previous rounds.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After three losses to rock, it becomes increasingly likely that my opponent will finally adapt:\n   a) They might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper\n   b) They might still stick with scissors (though this seems increasingly irrational)\n7. The fact that they're so persistent with scissors despite multiple losses suggests either:\n   a) They have a very strong bias toward scissors regardless of outcome\n   b) They're setting up for a strategic shift, hoping I'll continue playing rock\n8.

My total score is now -3 points.\n3. My opponent's sequence is: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n4. They've now played scissors in 13 out of 18 rounds (72%).\n5. A pattern is emerging: my opponent makes brief deviations from scissors (to rock or paper), but consistently returns to scissors afterward.\n6. When I play rock against their scissors, I consistently win.\n7. When I play paper, they almost always play scissors and I lose.\n8. When I play scissors, they either play scissors (tie) or occasionally rock or paper.\n9. Given their strong preference for scissors and their pattern of returning to it after deviations, the probability of them playing scissors again is high.\n10. If they play scissors again, my best move is rock.\n11. If they play rock again (less likely based on history), my best move would be paper.\n12. If they play paper (least likely based on history), my best move would be scissors.\n13. Given their demonstrated behavior pattern, scissors remains their most likely move by far.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on my opponent's strong historical preference for scissors (13/18 rounds = 72%) and their pattern of returning to scissors after brief deviations, I'll play rock again, which has consistently been successful against their preferred scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They've now played scissors in 14 out of 19 rounds (74%).\n5. I've won with rock against their scissors 6 times now.\n6. Their pattern of behavior is remarkably consistent: strong preference for scissors, occasional deviations, but always returning to scissors.\n7. After I win with rock against their scissors, they sometimes adapt by playing rock (round 17), but then quickly return to scissors.\n8. Given this pattern, they might:\n   a) Continue with scissors (most likely based on history)\n   b) Switch to rock to counter my anticipated rock (happened once before)\n   c) Switch to paper to counter my anticipated rock (least likely based on history)\n9. If they play scissors again, my best move is rock.\n10. If they switch to rock, my best move would be paper.\n11. If they switch to paper, my best move would be scissors.\n12. Given their demonstrated behavior pattern and the fact they just lost with scissors to rock, there's a slightly increased chance they might adapt with rock.\n13. However, their overall history suggests a very strong tendency to return to scissors regardless of outcomes.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given my opponent's extremely strong preference for scissors (14/19 rounds = 74%) and the fact that I've consistently won with rock against their scissors, I'll continue with this successful strategy and play rock again.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's sequence is: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n4. They've now played scissors in 19 out of 24 rounds (79%).\n5. They've now played scissors 8 times in a row.\n6. I've won with rock against their scissors 10 times now.\n7. Their behavior shows an almost unbelievable commitment to playing scissors regardless of repeated losses.\n8. At this point, I have to consider:\n   a) My opponent will continue with scissors due to an extremely strong preference or some other constraint\n   b) After 10 losses with the same pattern, they might finally adapt\n9. If they continue with scissors, rock is my best move.\n10. If they finally adapt with paper, scissors would be my best move.\n11. If they adapt with rock, paper would be my best move.\n12. Given their demonstrated behavior pattern (79% scissors, 8 in a row), scissors remains their overwhelmingly likely move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on my opponent's extraordinary commitment to scissors (19/24 rounds = 79%), their 8 consecutive scissors plays, and my consistent success with rock against their scissors, I'll continue with my successful strategy and play rock again.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Since they've shown increased adaptability recently and just played rock, paper seems like the optimal move to counter their expected rock or to beat their rock if they continue with it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given my opponent's recent shift to more adaptive play and their most recent rock move, I'll play paper which would beat rock if they continue with it (which seems likely) or at least has a balanced risk profile against their other possible moves.\n\n[move] paper\n"
