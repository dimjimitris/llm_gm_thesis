This gives me some information - my opponent chose paper in the first round.\n3. There are several possibilities for my opponent's next move:\n   - They might stick with paper, thinking I won't play paper again.\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors (to beat their paper), so they might play rock.\n   - They might play scissors to beat my previous paper move.\n4. Looking at the payoff structure, scissors beats paper (1 point), paper beats rock (3 points), and rock beats scissors (1 point).\n5. If I anticipate my opponent will play rock (to counter potential scissors), then I should play paper.\n6. If I anticipate they'll play paper again, I should play scissors.\n7. If I anticipate they'll play scissors, I should play rock.\n8.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

Looking at their pattern more carefully, they seem to be playing the move that would have beaten my previous move:\n   - After I played paper in round 1, they played scissors in round 2\n   - After I played rock in round 2, they played paper in round 3\n   - After I played scissors in round 3, they played rock in round 4\n7. If this pattern continues, after my paper in round 4, they would play scissors in round 5.\n8. To counter scissors, my best move would be rock.\n9.

Alternatively, they might think I'm getting overconfident with my winning streak and try to predict my next logical move.\n7. If I were predictable, after winning with paper, I might stick with paper or switch to scissors.\n8.

Given they just lost with paper against my scissors, basic game psychology suggests they'll most likely play rock to counter my anticipated scissors.\n\n10.

After losing with rock against my paper, they might:\n   - Anticipate I'll play paper again and counter with scissors\n   - Be completely demoralized after 25 consecutive losses and make an unpredictable move\n   - Follow their pattern, which suggests scissors might come next after rock\n\n6. If they play rock again, my best response would be paper (+3 points).\n\n7. If they play paper, my best response would be scissors (+1 point).\n\n8. If they play scissors, my best response would be rock (+1 point).\n\n9. Given they just lost with rock against my paper, basic game psychology suggests they'll most likely play scissors to counter my anticipated paper.\n\n10. Additionally, looking at their pattern after rock losses in previous rounds, they've consistently played scissors next.\n\n11.

After losing with paper against my scissors, they might:\n   - Anticipate I'll play scissors again and counter with rock\n   - Be completely demoralized after 27 consecutive losses and make an unpredictable move\n   - Follow their pattern, which suggests rock might come next after paper\n\n6. If they play rock, my best response would be paper (+3 points).\n\n7. If they play paper again, my best response would be scissors (+1 point).\n\n8. If they play scissors, my best response would be rock (+1 point).\n\n9. Given they just lost with paper against my scissors, basic game psychology suggests they'll most likely play rock to counter my anticipated scissors.\n\n10. Additionally, looking at their pattern after paper losses in previous rounds, they've typically played rock next.\n\n11. Rock seems like their most probable move, both psychologically and based on their pattern after paper.\n\n12.
