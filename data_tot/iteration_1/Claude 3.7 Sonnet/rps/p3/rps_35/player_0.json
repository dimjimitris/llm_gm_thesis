Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

There are several possibilities for my opponent's next move:\n   - They might stick with paper, thinking I won't play paper again.\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors (to beat their paper), so they might play rock.\n   - They might play scissors to beat my previous paper move.\n4. Looking at the payoff structure, scissors beats paper (1 point), paper beats rock (3 points), and rock beats scissors (1 point).\n5.

After losing with scissors against my rock, they might:\n   - Anticipate I'll play rock again and counter with paper\n   - Follow their historical pattern (which suggests paper might come next)\n   - Try something completely different out of frustration\n\n6. If they play rock, my best response would be paper (+3 points).\n\n7. If they play paper, my best response would be scissors (+1 point).\n\n8. If they play scissors again, my best response would be rock (+1 point).\n\n9. Given their pattern and the psychological factor of having just lost with scissors, paper seems most likely - both to counter my anticipated rock play and to follow their own pattern after scissors.\n\n10. To counter their anticipated paper move, scissors would be my best choice.\n\n11. I'll choose scissors for this round to counter their likely paper play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After losing with rock against my paper, they might:\n   - Anticipate I'll play paper again and counter with scissors\n   - Be completely demoralized after 16 consecutive losses and make an unpredictable move\n   - Follow their pattern, which suggests scissors might come next after rock\n\n6. If they play rock again, my best response would be paper (+3 points).\n\n7. If they play paper, my best response would be scissors (+1 point).\n\n8. If they play scissors, my best response would be rock (+1 point).\n\n9. Given they just lost with rock against my paper, basic game psychology suggests they'll most likely play scissors to counter my anticipated paper.\n\n10.

I've won 27 rounds and tied twice, maintaining a perfect record without losses.\n\n3. My opponent's move pattern has been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n4. After paper, they've historically played scissors (rounds 2, 5), rock (rounds 4, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27), or paper again (round 1).\n\n5. After losing with paper against my scissors, they might:\n   - Anticipate I'll play scissors again and counter with rock\n   - Be completely demoralized after 27 consecutive losses and make an unpredictable move\n   - Follow their pattern, which suggests rock might come next after paper\n\n6. If they play rock, my best response would be paper (+3 points).\n\n7. If they play paper again, my best response would be scissors (+1 point).\n\n8. If they play scissors, my best response would be rock (+1 point).\n\n9. Given they just lost with paper against my scissors, basic game psychology suggests they'll most likely play rock to counter my anticipated scissors.\n\n10. Additionally, looking at their pattern after paper losses in previous rounds, they've typically played rock next.\n\n11. Rock seems like their most probable move, both psychologically and based on their pattern after paper.\n\n12. To counter their anticipated rock move, paper would be my best choice, with the highest potential reward (3 points).\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper\n"
