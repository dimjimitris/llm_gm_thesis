Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My opponent's last three moves have been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   This continues their apparent cycle.\n\n4. If they maintain this pattern, their next move would be rock.\n\n5. However, they've now lost two rounds in a row, which might motivate them to change their strategy.\n\n6. Looking at their overall pattern across all rounds:\n   - They started with paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors (a standard rotation)\n   - Then went rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper (continuing the rotation)\n   - This strongly suggests they're using a systematic rotation approach\n\n7. Given the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1/-1)\n\n8. If I anticipate they'll play rock next (continuing their cycle), paper would be my best response, giving me +3 points.\n\n9. There's a risk they might break their pattern after two consecutive losses, but their consistent rotation throughout the game suggests they might stick with it.\n\n10. The potential reward for correctly predicting rock (+3) outweighs the potential loss if they play scissors instead (-1).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper this round, anticipating they'll continue their rotation pattern with rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

However, their consistent adherence to the pattern throughout the game, even during losing streaks, suggests they might continue with it.\n\n10. Since they've lost three times in a row, they might be more likely to break the pattern now than before. This creates uncertainty.\n\n11. Rock is still my safest bet based on their established pattern, and it would only lose moderately (-3) to paper if they do break pattern.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock this round, anticipating they'll continue their rotation pattern with scissors, while acknowledging the increased risk they might finally break their pattern.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has maintained their rotation pattern throughout the entire game with extraordinary consistency:\n   paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   This shows they're following a clear pattern with just one early deviation.\n\n4. If they continue this remarkably predictable pattern, their next move would be scissors.\n\n5. Despite losing nine rounds in a row, they've stubbornly stuck to their pattern, which strongly suggests they might continue with it.\n\n6. Given the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1/-1)\n\n7. If I anticipate they'll play scissors next (continuing their rotation), rock would be my best response, giving me +1 point.\n\n8. There's always a possibility they might finally break their pattern after nine consecutive losses, but their extraordinary consistency throughout the game suggests they're either committed to their strategy or unable to adapt.\n\n9. Even after multiple losing streaks, they've maintained their pattern without deviation, which gives me extremely high confidence that they'll continue with it.\n\n10. At this point, it would be irrational to expect them to change their strategy after such consistent behavior.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock this round, anticipating they'll continue their rotation pattern with scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let me review the complete history of moves:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 24: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 25: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 26: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 27: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n2. I've now won twenty rounds in a row by correctly anticipating my opponent's moves.\n\n3. My opponent has maintained their rotation pattern throughout the entire game with extraordinary consistency:\n   paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   This shows they're following a clear pattern with just one early deviation.\n\n4. If they continue this remarkably predictable pattern, their next move would be rock.\n\n5. Despite losing twenty rounds in a row, they've stubbornly stuck to their pattern, which strongly suggests they might continue with it.\n\n6. Given the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1/-1)\n\n7. If I anticipate they'll play rock next (continuing their rotation), paper would be my best response, giving me +3 points.\n\n8. There's always a possibility they might finally break their pattern after twenty consecutive losses, but their extraordinary consistency throughout the game suggests they're either committed to their strategy or unable to adapt.\n\n9. Even after multiple losing streaks, they've maintained their pattern without deviation, which gives me extremely high confidence that they'll continue with it.\n\n10. At this point, after 27 rounds of nearly perfect pattern adherence, I can be virtually certain they will continue with their next expected move in the sequence.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper this round, anticipating they'll continue their rotation pattern with rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"
