I've now lost five rounds and tied twice, suggesting my opponent has a very effective strategy.\n4. Looking at their most recent three moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, they appear to be following the standard cycle of rock-paper-scissors but in reverse order.\n5. If they continue this pattern, their next move would likely be paper.\n6. However, they might also be adapting to my moves rather than following a strict cycle.\n7. When I've played paper (Rounds 1, 3, 4, 7), they've responded with paper twice and scissors twice.\n8. When I've played scissors (Rounds 2, 6), they've consistently countered with rock.\n9. When I played rock (Round 5), they countered with paper.\n10. It seems like they might be anticipating my moves or following a more complex pattern.\n11. Given their apparent cycle and my losing streak, I need to try something different.\n12. If they're truly following the paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper pattern, they'll play paper next.\n13. To counter paper, scissors would be my best move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, which would give me +1 point if they play paper as their pattern suggests.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
