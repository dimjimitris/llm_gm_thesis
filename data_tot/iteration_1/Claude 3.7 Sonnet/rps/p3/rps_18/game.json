The scissors choice has good potential for a win (+1 point) if they continue with paper, and even if they counter with rock, the loss (-1) is less severe than other potential losses in the game.\n"

They switched from paper back to rock when I played scissors.

They've played rock in 4 of the last 5 rounds, only deviating once with paper.\n\nI'll play paper this round because:\n- Paper beats their frequently played rock (+3 points)\n- Their return to rock after briefly playing paper suggests they may continue with rock\n- After my loss with scissors, they might expect me to play rock (a common response after losing with scissors) and continue with paper, which my paper would tie\n- The risk/reward ratio favors paper against an opponent with a rock preference\n\nThis move capitalizes on their demonstrated pattern while maintaining a favorable risk/reward profile.\n",

Rock is the strategic counter to their scissors, and even if they counter perfectly again, I'm maintaining proper rock-paper-scissors strategy rather than making random moves out of frustration.\n",
        "[move] Rock\n\nI lost again, with paper against their scissors. Looking at the recent pattern:\n\n27: I rock, they paper (I lose)\n28: I scissors, they rock (I lose)\n29: I paper, they scissors (I lose)\n\nMy opponent has now countered my last five moves perfectly, showing remarkable anticipation of my choices.\n\nI'll play rock this round because:\n1) They just played scissors, which rock directly counters\n2) After five consecutive perfect counters, they might expect me to break from the logical response and try something unexpected\n3) If they anticipate I'll play rock and counter with paper, I would lose, but I need to maintain sound strategic principles\n4) Breaking this losing streak is absolutely critical\n\nThis move responds directly to their last play. While they've shown an uncanny ability to counter my moves, I still need to play according to solid rock-paper-scissors strategy rather than making random choices out of frustration. Rock is the logical counter to their scissors, and if they continue their perfect countering, at least I'm playing according to sound principles rather than trying to outguess what has proven to be a highly effective opponent.\n"
