Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, I can still try to anticipate their next move based on psychology:\n   - After four ties, my opponent might be frustrated and try something unexpected\n   - They might return to paper, which was successful for them in rounds 1 and 3\n   - They might expect me to play paper to beat their rock, and thus play scissors\n10.

Their last three moves were:\n   scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   \n7. If they continue this pattern, they would play scissors next.\n\n8. However, after losing two rounds in a row, they might change their strategy:\n   - They might break their pattern to be less predictable\n   - They might anticipate that I've detected their pattern and will counter\n   - They might expect me to play scissors again since it worked in round 9\n\n9. Given I just won with paper, they might expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors.\n   \n10. If I assume they'll play scissors next (either continuing their pattern or countering my paper):\n    - I should play rock to beat their scissors (+1)\n    \n11. If they break their pattern and play rock again:\n    - Playing rock would result in a tie (0)\n    \n12. If they play paper instead:\n    - Playing rock would lose (-3)\n    \n13. Given these possibilities, rock seems to be the safest choice with good winning potential.\n14. It would win against scissors (+1), tie with rock (0), and only lose significantly to paper (-3).\n15. Since I've already won two rounds in a row, I can afford to take a more conservative approach.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, anticipating their scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This is the first time the opponent has broken their pattern. Instead of playing scissors as their pattern would suggest, they played rock.\n\n5. This could indicate:\n   - They've finally abandoned their predictable pattern\n   - They're trying to be more strategic after losing several rounds\n   - They might be starting a new pattern\n\n6. Looking at their most recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   This follows the classic RPS cycle in reverse, which has been their pattern throughout.\n\n7. If they're starting a new sequence, they might play paper or scissors next.\n\n8. If they're continuing with some pattern, paper would be the logical next move (following rock in their usual sequence).\n\n9. If they're now trying to counter my moves, they might anticipate I'll play paper (to beat their rock) and play scissors.\n\n10. Given these possibilities:\n    - If they play paper, I should play scissors (+1)\n    - If they play scissors, I should play rock (+1)\n    - If they play rock again, I should play paper (+3)\n\n11. Since their pattern broke with rock last round, paper seems like a good strategic choice:\n    - It beats rock if they play it again (+3)\n    - If they're returning to their pattern with paper, we'd tie (0)\n    - The risk is losing to scissors (-1), which is a moderate loss\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, which gives the highest potential reward.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After breaking their pattern in round 13 with rock, they've now played paper in round 14.\n\n5. Looking at their most recent moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   This doesn't match their earlier pattern exactly but could be the start of a new pattern.\n\n6. If we look at their overall game, they've shown a preference for paper (6 times), followed by scissors and rock (4 times each).\n\n7. After two consecutive ties, they might try to break the tie streak with a different move.\n\n8. Their moves in the last 5 rounds have been: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   If they're establishing a new pattern, they might play scissors next.\n\n9. Given these possibilities:\n    - If they play scissors, I should play rock (+1)\n    - If they play rock, I should play paper (+3)\n    - If they play paper again, I should play scissors (+1)\n\n10. Since we've just had two consecutive ties, and they seem to be developing a new pattern, rock seems like a strategic choice:\n    - It beats scissors if they're returning to that move (+1)\n    - It ties with rock if they play that (0)\n    - The risk is losing to paper (-3)\n\n11.

Looking at their most recent moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   This doesn't follow a clear pattern.\n\n5. If I look at the entire game history, my opponent started with a clear pattern but has become less predictable in recent rounds.\n\n6. We've now tied with rock. In rock-paper-scissors, a common human tendency after a tie is to switch to the move that would have beaten the previous move. This would suggest my opponent might play paper next (to beat our mutual rock).\n\n7. However, they might also anticipate that I'll think this way and play scissors to counter my expected paper.\n\n8. Given these possibilities:\n    - If they play paper (to beat our mutual rock), I should play scissors (+1)\n    - If they play scissors (anticipating my paper), I should play rock (+1)\n    - If they play rock again, I should play paper (+3)\n\n9. Looking at the overall distribution of their moves:\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Rock: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n   This is fairly balanced, with a slight preference for paper and rock.\n\n10. Since we just tied with rock, and considering the psychological tendency to switch after a tie, scissors seems like a strategic choice:\n    - It beats paper if they follow the common pattern after a tie (+1)\n    - It loses to rock if they play it again (-1)\n    - It ties with scissors (0)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at their most recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   This suggests they might be developing a new pattern.\n\n5. We've now had two consecutive ties (rock \u2192 scissors). In rock-paper-scissors psychology, after two consecutive ties, players often try to break the pattern by choosing the move that would beat what would beat the last move. Since our last mutual move was scissors, the move that beats scissors is rock, and the move that beats rock is paper. So they might play paper.\n\n6. However, they might also be thinking:\n   - \"After scissors, the logical next move is rock\" (following the classic RPS cycle)\n   - \"My opponent will expect me to play rock after scissors, so I'll play paper to beat their expected rock\"\n   - \"My opponent will overthink this, so I'll just play scissors again\"\n\n7. Given these possibilities:\n    - If they play paper (to beat expected rock), I should play scissors (+1)\n    - If they play rock (following classic RPS cycle), I should play paper (+3)\n    - If they play scissors again, I should play rock (+1)\n\n8. Looking at the overall distribution of their moves:\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Rock: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n   Their moves are now perfectly balanced across the three options.\n\n9. Given the psychology of breaking tie streaks and the classic RPS cycle following scissors, rock seems like a strong choice:\n    - It beats scissors if they play it again (+1)\n    - It loses to paper if they anticipate my move (-3)\n    - It follows the natural progression after scissors in RPS\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

However, after winning significantly with paper, they might:\n   - Stick with paper since it worked well (won them 3 points)\n   - Anticipate that I'll play paper to beat their expected rock, and play scissors\n   - Follow their pattern and play scissors\n\n7.

Given their remarkably consistent pattern throughout the entire game (even through multiple losses), and the fact that rock would both continue my winning sequence and counter their expected scissors (if they follow their pattern), rock seems like the optimal choice.\n\n10.
