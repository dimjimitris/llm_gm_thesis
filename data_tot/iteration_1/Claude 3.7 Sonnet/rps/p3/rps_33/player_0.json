Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is the first round against a fresh player, so I don't have any history to base my decision on.\n2. In rock-paper-scissors, no single move is inherently better than others in a vacuum.\n3. However, looking at the point structure, winning with paper (3 points) gives more points than winning with rock or scissors (1 point each).\n4. The risk of playing paper is potentially losing 1 point if the opponent plays scissors.\n5. The risk of playing rock is potentially losing 3 points if the opponent plays paper.\n6. The risk of playing scissors is potentially losing 1 point if the opponent plays rock.\n7. Without prior information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider what a fresh player might play first.\n8. Rock is often a common first move for many players, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n9. If I expect rock to be played, paper would be my optimal response.\n10. The reward for correctly playing paper against rock (3 points) outweighs the risk of incorrectly playing paper against scissors (-1 point).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for the first round, as it has the highest potential payoff and counters a common first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After losing to paper, many players will switch their strategy.\n4. A common reaction would be to play scissors in the next round to counter the previous paper play.\n5.

Another possibility is that my opponent might stick with rock, thinking I wouldn't expect them to repeat the same move.\n7.

At this point, it seems virtually certain they're programmed to follow this pattern regardless of outcomes.\n8. Given their demonstrated behavior through 10 rounds without a single deviation, there remains an extremely high probability they'll continue with paper.\n9. If they play paper as the pattern suggests, scissors would win me 1 point.\n10. If they break pattern with rock, I lose 1 point.\n11.

My opponent has now followed the exact same pattern for 25 consecutive rounds: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n3. I've now won twenty-two rounds in a row by correctly predicting their moves based on this pattern.\n4. If they continue this pattern, they would play paper next.\n5. To counter paper, I should play scissors.\n6. After losing twenty-two consecutive rounds without any adaptation, it's virtually certain they will continue following this pattern.\n7. The pattern has been 100% consistent through 25 rounds without a single deviation.\n8. Given this extraordinary consistency, there's an extremely high probability they'll continue with paper.\n9. If they play paper as the pattern suggests, scissors would win me 1 point.\n10. If they break pattern with rock, I lose 1 point.\n11. If they break pattern with scissors, we tie (0 points).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, anticipating that despite twenty-two consecutive losses, my opponent will continue their rotation pattern and play paper next. Their perfect adherence to the pattern over 25 rounds makes this prediction extremely reliable.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
