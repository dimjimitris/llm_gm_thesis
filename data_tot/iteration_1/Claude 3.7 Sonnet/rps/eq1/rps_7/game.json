Following my established pattern after winning with scissors against paper, I'll play rock this round. My opponent has consistently played in a way that loses to my moves throughout our entire match. They appear to be following the pattern scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock, which perfectly loses to my rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors pattern. I'll continue with rock and see if this extraordinary winning streak can extend even further.\n"
