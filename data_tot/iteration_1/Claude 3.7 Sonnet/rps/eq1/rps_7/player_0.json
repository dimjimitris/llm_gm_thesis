My opponent must be frustrated and may be trying various strategies to counter me. They might anticipate I'll continue my pattern and play scissors to beat my paper, or they might try rock again hoping I'll switch things up. Despite the increasing risk that my opponent will finally adapt to my pattern, the consistent cycle of rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors has been extraordinarily successful. I'll continue with paper and see if I can reach a perfect ten wins.\n"
