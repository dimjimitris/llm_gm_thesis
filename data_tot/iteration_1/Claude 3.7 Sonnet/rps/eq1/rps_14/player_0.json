    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

If the opponent is mirroring my moves, then whatever I play, they'll play the same.\n\n5. Let's test the mirroring hypothesis by deliberately choosing paper.

However, there's a small chance this is an extraordinary coincidence and they're actually following their own strategy.\n\n6. In a true mirroring situation, no choice gives me an advantage.\n\n7.

In a perfect mirroring situation, no strategy can give me an advantage - whatever I play will result in a tie.\n\n4. However, there may be a psychological aspect to consider. If I establish a pattern and then break it, I might be able to \"trick\" the mirroring player:\n   - If I play the same move multiple times in a row, they might anticipate I'll play it again and prepare a counter\n   - Then if I switch, I might catch them off guard\n\n5. Let me try a different approach. I'll play rock this round, with the intention of playing rock again next round, and then switching to paper in the round after that (if the mirroring continues).\n\n6. This is essentially setting up a longer-term strategy rather than trying to win this specific round, which seems impossible against a perfect mirror.\n\n7. If by chance they're not mirroring but have just happened to make the same choices as me for six rounds (extremely unlikely), then any move has an equal chance of winning.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, as part of a longer-term strategy to potentially break the mirroring pattern.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We've had another tie, with both of us playing rock.\n\n3. Examining the pattern of the last several rounds:\n   - Round 17: paper-paper (tie)\n   - Round 18: scissors-scissors (tie)\n   - Round 19: rock-rock (tie)\n\n4. This is interesting - we've cycled through all three moves in sequence, with ties each time. This could indicate:\n   - The opponent may have returned to mirroring my moves\n   - Or this could be an extraordinary coincidence\n\n5. If they are mirroring again, then whatever I play will result in a tie.\n\n6. Looking at the larger pattern, the opponent has shown:\n   - Long streaks of the same move (especially scissors)\n   - Periods of apparent mirroring\n   - Occasional strategic counters to my moves\n\n7. If they're mirroring, any move has equal value.\n   If they're continuing the cycle we've established, paper would be next in sequence.\n   If they're trying to win after a tie, they might play paper to beat rock.\n\n8. Given these possibilities, and the fact that they've shown a tendency to play scissors historically, scissors would be a reasonable counter to their potential paper play.\n\n9. However, I should also consider that they might anticipate this reasoning and play rock to counter my scissors.\n\n10. Weighing all factors, I think paper is my best move - it would tie if they're mirroring, beat rock if they repeat, and only lose to scissors (which they might play but is less likely given the recent sequence).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let's analyze the complete pattern of moves so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 24: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 25: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 26: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n\n2. My opponent just switched from paper to scissors, beating my paper.\n\n3. Looking at their recent sequence:\n   - Round 23: paper\n   - Round 24: paper\n   - Round 25: paper\n   - Round 26: scissors\n\n4. They broke their paper streak and returned to scissors, which has been their most common move overall (now 12/26 rounds, or 46%).\n\n5. After winning with scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (they've shown a tendency to repeat successful moves)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I'll play rock to counter their scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (if they think I might play scissors to counter their scissors)\n\n6. Given their pattern of behavior:\n   - They've shown a strong preference for scissors throughout the game\n   - They tend to stick with successful moves\n   - They occasionally make strategic switches\n\n7. Their return to scissors after the paper streak suggests they might be reverting to their preferred strategy.\n\n8. If they play scissors again, I should play rock.\n   If they switch to rock, I should play paper.\n   If they switch to paper, I should play scissors.\n\n9. Considering their strong historical preference for scissors and their recent win with it, rock seems like the most logical choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, which would beat scissors if they continue with it (which seems likely given their history and recent success).\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has switched back to paper, beating my rock.\n\n3. Looking at their recent sequence:\n   - Round 24: paper\n   - Round 25: paper\n   - Round 26: scissors\n   - Round 27: paper\n\n4. My opponent appears to be playing somewhat unpredictably now, switching between paper and scissors.\n\n5. Analyzing their overall choices:\n   - They've played scissors 12 times (44%)\n   - They've played paper 11 times (41%)\n   - They've played rock 4 times (15%)\n\n6. Their play has become more balanced between scissors and paper, with rock used much less frequently.\n\n7. After winning with paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper (they've shown a tendency to repeat successful moves)\n   - Switch to scissors (they've alternated between paper and scissors recently)\n   - Switch to rock (least likely given their low usage of rock)\n\n8. If they play paper again, I should play scissors.\n   If they switch to scissors, I should play rock.\n   If they switch to rock, I should play paper.\n\n9. Given their recent pattern of alternating between paper and scissors, and their win with paper, scissors seems like the strongest play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, anticipating they'll continue with paper after their recent win with it.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has now played paper two times in a row (Rounds 27-28).\n\n3. I just won with scissors against their paper.\n\n4. Looking at their recent sequence:\n   - Round 25: paper\n   - Round 26: scissors\n   - Round 27: paper\n   - Round 28: paper\n\n5. After losing with paper against my scissors, they might:\n   - Switch to rock to counter my scissors (the rational move)\n   - Continue with paper despite losing (they've shown this tendency before)\n   - Switch to scissors (their historically preferred move)\n\n6. Analyzing their behavior after losses:\n   - In Round 26, they switched from paper to scissors after losing\n   - In Round 27, they switched back to paper after losing\n   - They've shown inconsistent adaptation after losses\n\n7. Given that they just lost to scissors with paper, the rational move would be for them to switch to rock.\n\n8. However, they've rarely played rock (only 4 times in 28 rounds), suggesting they may be reluctant to use it.\n\n9. They might instead switch back to scissors, which has been their most frequent choice overall.\n\n10. If they switch to rock, I should play paper.\n    If they stick with paper, I should play scissors again.\n    If they play scissors, I should play rock.\n\n11. Given their historical reluctance to play rock, their preference for scissors, and the fact that they just lost to scissors, rock seems like the safest choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, anticipating they'll switch to scissors after losing to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"
