    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

After experiencing repeated losses with their paper-scissors pattern, they finally changed strategy and were rewarded with a win.\n5. After winning with rock, they're likely to either:\n   a) Continue with rock since it worked well, or\n   b) Switch to paper expecting me to play rock to counter their previous rock\n6. Option (a) seems more likely given their tendency to repeat successful moves.\n7. However, given their previous rigid pattern and this new success, they might be thinking more strategically now.\n8. If they play rock again, I should play paper.\n9. If they anticipate this and play scissors, I would lose.\n10. Considering their historical pattern and psychological factors after their first win, they're most likely to stick with rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this twelfth round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This suggests they might go back to their comfort zone of paper, but could also continue experimenting with rock.\n6.

They've now played scissors three times in a row, after their previous streak of playing rock seven times.\n4. After losing with scissors in Rounds 19 and 20, they've continued using it, which aligns with their pattern of sticking with moves despite losses.\n5. Their overall pattern shows they get fixated on specific moves for extended periods:\n   - Paper phase (Rounds 1-10, with occasional scissors)\n   - Rock phase (Rounds 11-17)\n   - Scissors phase (Rounds 18-20)\n6. Given they've lost twice with scissors but continued using it, they're demonstrating the same stubborn behavior they showed with rock.\n7. Looking at their pattern after consecutive losses:\n   - They typically continue with the same move at least once more\n   - They eventually adapt, but usually after multiple losses\n8. Given their historical pattern and current scissors streak despite losses, they're most likely to play scissors again.\n9. To counter scissors, I should play rock again.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this twenty-first round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given they've lost three times in a row with scissors but continued using it, they're exhibiting extreme stubbornness similar to what they showed with rock.\n7. However, after multiple consecutive losses, the probability they finally change their strategy increases.\n8. Looking at their overall pattern:\n   - They stick with moves for extended periods\n   - They eventually adapt, but only after multiple losses\n   - When they do change, they tend to switch decisively to a new move\n9. Given their historical pattern, they're still most likely to play scissors again, but the probability they switch to paper (to counter my rock) has increased.\n10.

Given they've lost five times in a row with scissors but continued using it, they're exhibiting possibly the most extreme form of stubbornness in their pattern.\n7. However, after five consecutive losses, the probability they finally change their strategy has increased substantially.\n8.

Looking at their pattern after consecutive losses:\n   - They typically continue with the same move at least once more\n   - They've shown they can persist with a losing move for multiple rounds\n8. Given their historical pattern and current paper streak despite losses, they're most likely to play paper again.\n9. To counter paper, I should play scissors again.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this twenty-seventh round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've now played paper four times in a row, continuing their pattern of phase-based play.\n4. After losing with paper in Rounds 25, 26, and 27, they've continued using it, further confirming their pattern of extreme persistence with moves despite consecutive losses.\n5. Their overall pattern clearly shows:\n   - Paper phase (Rounds 1-10, with occasional scissors)\n   - Rock phase (Rounds 11-17)\n   - Scissors phase (Rounds 18-23)\n   - New paper phase (Rounds 24-27)\n6. Given they've lost three times in a row with paper but continued using it, they're exhibiting the same stubborn behavior they showed with scissors (where they lost 5 times in a row but continued).\n7. Looking at their pattern after multiple consecutive losses:\n   - With scissors, they persisted for 6 rounds despite losing 5 times\n   - Their commitment to phases seems to override their response to losses\n8. Given their historical pattern and current paper streak despite losses, they're most likely to play paper again.\n9. To counter paper, I should play scissors again.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this twenty-eighth round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've broken their paper streak and switched to rock in Round 28, winning with it.\n4. This represents a significant shift in their pattern - after 4 rounds of paper, they've switched to rock.\n5. Looking at their overall phase pattern:\n   - Paper phase (Rounds 1-10, with occasional scissors)\n   - Rock phase (Rounds 11-17)\n   - Scissors phase (Rounds 18-23)\n   - Paper phase (Rounds 24-27)\n   - Possibly starting a new rock phase (Round 28)\n6. After winning with rock in Round 28, based on their pattern of sticking with successful moves, they're likely to continue with rock.\n7. Their historical pattern shows they commit to a move after it wins, often starting a new phase.\n8.
