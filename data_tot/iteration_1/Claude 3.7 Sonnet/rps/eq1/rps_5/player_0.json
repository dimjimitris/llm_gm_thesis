    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This suggests they might be adapting their strategy again or trying to be less predictable.\n\n6. Looking at their overall pattern throughout the game, they've played paper 8 times, rock 7 times, and scissors 4 times, showing a preference for paper.\n\n7. Since they just played paper and have shown a tendency to repeat moves, they might play paper again.\n\n8. Alternatively, they might anticipate that I'll choose scissors to counter their paper and play rock.\n\n9. Given their apparent adaptability and the fact that they've broken their pattern, I need to be careful not to be too predictable myself.\n\n10. I'll choose scissors this time, which would beat paper if they repeat it, and would lose to rock if they anticipate my move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After a tie, players often switch to a move that would beat what was just played.\n\n5. Since we both played scissors, my opponent might switch to rock (which beats scissors).\n\n6. If they expect me to switch to rock (to beat their expected rock), they might choose paper.\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern, they've shown adaptability and a mix of predictable sequences and unexpected moves.\n\n8. Given the tie with scissors, and the psychological tendency to switch after a tie, I think there's a good chance they'll play rock.\n\n9. If they play rock, my best response would be paper.\n\n10. I'll choose paper this time, which would beat rock if they make that choice after our scissors tie.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper\n\n[move] paper\n"

After a tie, players often change their move, expecting the opponent to do the same.\n\n5. Looking at previous instances where we tied:\n   - After the paper-paper tie in round 1, both played rock in round 2 (tie)\n   - After the rock-rock tie in round 2, I played scissors and they played rock in round 3 (I lost)\n   - After the paper-paper tie in round 12, both played paper again in round 13 (tie)\n   - After the paper-paper tie in round 13, both played rock in round 14 (tie)\n   - After the rock-rock tie in round 14, I played scissors and they played rock in round 15 (I lost)\n   - After the scissors-scissors tie in round 20, I played paper and they played scissors in round 21 (I lost)\n\n6. There's no clear pattern in how they respond after ties, but they've played rock multiple times after ties.\n\n7. Since we both played paper in the last round, they might expect me to switch to scissors (to beat their expected paper) and counter with rock.\n\n8. Alternatively, they might switch to scissors themselves to beat our previous paper.\n\n9. Given the history of the game and the psychological tendency to change after a tie, I think there's a good chance they'll play either rock or scissors.\n\n10. I'll choose rock this time, which would beat scissors if they switch to it, and would lose to paper if they anticipate my move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

They've now played paper twice in a row.\n\n5. Looking at their overall pattern, they've played paper 12 times, rock 9 times, and scissors 6 times, showing a clear preference for paper.\n\n6. When they've played paper multiple times in a row previously (rounds 11-13), they eventually switched to rock.\n\n7. However, they might also anticipate that I'll choose scissors to counter their paper streak and play rock.\n\n8. Given their preference for paper throughout the game and their success with it against my rock, there's a chance they might play paper again.\n\n9. Alternatively, they might switch to rock expecting me to play scissors.\n\n10.
