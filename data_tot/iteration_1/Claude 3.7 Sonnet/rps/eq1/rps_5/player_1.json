Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, all three moves (rock, paper, scissors) have equal expected value.\n3. Studies suggest that in the first round of rock-paper-scissors, people often choose rock slightly more frequently, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n4. However, knowing this, some players might anticipate this tendency and choose paper to counter the expected rock.\n5. Without specific information about my opponent, I need to make a strategic choice while knowing my opponent has already decided.\n6.

This suggests an interesting dynamic - my opponent and I seem to be thinking similarly or following similar patterns.\n3. There appears to be a progression from paper \u2192 rock, following a counter-clockwise movement in the traditional rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n4. If this pattern continues, the natural next move would be scissors.\n5. However, my opponent might also recognize this pattern and:\n   a) Continue the pattern by choosing scissors\n   b) Try to counter my expected scissors by choosing rock\n   c) Break the pattern entirely with paper\n6.

Instead of paper (which would follow scissors in their previous cycle), they played rock.\n4.

If they're starting a new pattern similar to their previous one (cycling counter-clockwise), after rock they would play paper.\n7. If they're now trying to counter my moves, they might expect me to play rock (to beat their expected paper), and thus play scissors.\n8.

Analyzing the pattern so far:\n   - Round 1-9: Followed a consistent pattern, I won 7 consecutive rounds after 2 initial ties\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n2. The opponent has clearly changed their strategy after round 9.\n3. Looking at their most recent moves:\n   - Round 9: They played scissors\n   - Round 10: They played rock\n   - Round 11: They played scissors\n4. This suggests they may be starting a new pattern that alternates between rock and scissors.\n5. If they're following this alternating pattern, their next move would be rock.\n6. Another possibility is that they've switched to a strategy of playing what would beat my previous move:\n   - Round 10: I played scissors in Round 9, they played rock (beats scissors)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors in Round 10, they played scissors (would tie scissors, but I actually played paper)\n7. If they're following this \"beat previous move\" strategy, they would expect me to play scissors (to beat their expected paper) and would play rock to counter.\n8. Both analyses (alternating pattern and countering previous move) suggest rock as their most likely next move.\n9. To counter rock, I should play paper.\n10. However, given that I've lost twice after changing my approach, I need to be cautious about any prediction.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as my move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyzing the recent pattern:\n   - Round 10: Opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 11: Opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 12: Opponent played paper (tie)\n2. The opponent's moves in the last three rounds have been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n3. This sequence is interesting because it follows a clockwise rotation in the rock-paper-scissors cycle, which is the opposite of their initial pattern in rounds 1-9.\n4. If they're following this new clockwise pattern, their next move would be rock (following paper in the clockwise direction).\n5. Another possibility is that they've adopted a strategy of mirroring my previous move:\n   - Round 11: I played scissors in Round 10, they played scissors\n   - Round 12: I played paper in Round 11, they played paper\n6. If they're following this mirroring strategy, they would play paper again (mirroring my paper from Round 12).\n7. A third possibility is that they're reacting to the outcome of the previous round:\n   - After their two wins, they changed strategy\n   - After our tie, they might stick with paper (thinking I'll switch) or change to something else\n8. Weighing these possibilities:\n   - If they follow the clockwise pattern: they'll play rock\n   - If they mirror my last move: they'll play paper\n   - If they react to the tie: unpredictable\n9. Given the most recent pattern and the higher likelihood of the clockwise rotation (which matches their previous tendency to follow patterns), I'll prepare for them playing rock.\n10.

The opponent's recent moves suggest they may have shifted strategies again.\n3. Having played paper twice in a row indicates either:\n   a) They're stuck on paper for some reason\n   b) They're trying to establish a new pattern\n   c) They're mirroring my moves (since I played paper both times)\n4. After two consecutive ties with the same move, there's a strong psychological tendency to change moves.\n5. If they follow basic game theory, they're likely to switch from paper after two ties.\n6. Their most likely next moves would be:\n   a) Rock - if they're continuing the clockwise rotation but skipped a move\n   b) Scissors - the most logical choice to break out of paper ties\n   c) Paper again - least likely unless they're following a fixed algorithm\n7. Since scissors beats paper, and we've had two paper ties in a row, scissors becomes the most probable move for them to make.\n8. To counter their expected scissors play, I should choose rock.\n9.

The opponent has moved from paper to rock, suggesting they may be following a counter-clockwise rotation again (paper \u2192 rock).\n3. If they're following this counter-clockwise pattern (similar to their original strategy in rounds 1-9), their next move would be scissors.\n4. Another possibility is that they're mirroring my moves with a one-round delay:\n   - I played paper in Round 12, they played paper in Round 13\n   - I played paper in Round 13, they played rock in Round 14\n5. If they're following this delayed mirroring strategy, they would play rock again (mirroring my rock from Round 14).\n6. We've now had three consecutive ties, which creates strong psychological pressure to break the tie streak.\n7. After playing rock, the natural tendency is to shift to paper (following the counter-clockwise direction that most players intuitively follow).\n8.

Looking at their most recent moves:\n   - Round 22: Rock\n   - Round 23: Scissors\n   - Round 24: Rock\n5. This could suggest they've changed their pattern again, possibly:\n   a) Repeating rock after seeing it was successful\n   b) Starting a new pattern that includes rock twice\n   c) Responding to my predictable strategy by breaking their own pattern\n6. Given that they just won with rock, there's a psychological tendency for players to stick with a winning move.\n7. They might expect me to play paper to counter their expected rock repeat, and thus play scissors.\n8. Alternatively, if they're returning to their counter-clockwise pattern after this deviation, they would play scissors (following rock).\n9. Both of these analyses suggest scissors as a likely next move.\n10. If they play scissors, rock would be my optimal response.\n11. If they repeat rock again, paper would be better, but this seems less likely given their pattern-based history.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock as my move.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

If they're following this alternating pattern, their next move would be rock.\n6. Alternatively, if they've returned to their counter-clockwise pattern, after scissors they would play paper.\n7. Given their overall game history, both patterns (alternating rock-scissors or counter-clockwise rotation) have been observed.\n8. The more recent pattern suggests rock-scissors alternation, which would predict rock next.\n9. To counter rock, I should play paper.\n10.
