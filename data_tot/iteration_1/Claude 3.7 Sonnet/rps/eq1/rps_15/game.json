This is the first round against a fresh player, so I have no historical data to base my decision on.\n2. In rock-paper-scissors, without prior information, no move has a theoretical advantage over others.\n3. Players often choose rock as their first move, as studies have shown it's psychologically appealing as a \"strong\" opening move.\n4. However, knowing this tendency, I could choose paper to counter the likely rock.\n5. But if my opponent is also strategic, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n6. Without specific information about my opponent, I need a move that gives me a reasonable chance.\n7. I'll choose paper for this first round, as it counters the common first-move rock tendency.\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

I've now won 28 out of 29 rounds by recognizing and exploiting this pattern.\n\n4. If they continue this absolutely established pattern, their next move would be scissors.\n\n5. To counter scissors, my optimal move would be rock.\n\n6. The pattern is completely established and there is no indication it will change.\n\n7. The evidence for their cycling pattern is conclusive (29 consecutive moves following it).\n\n8. Based on this perfect predictability, I should assume they'll play scissors next.\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"
