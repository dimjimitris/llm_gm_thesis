Since this is the first round, I have no information about the other player's tendencies or strategies.\n4. In a single round with no prior information, any choice is equally valid from a game theory perspective.\n5. Studies show that in the first round of rock-paper-scissors, people slightly favor rock as their opening move.\n6. Knowing this psychological tendency, paper would be a slightly better strategic choice.\n7. However, the advantage is minimal and the opponent could just as easily choose scissors or paper.\n8.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without history or patterns to detect, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of winning.\n3. Since this is the first round, I have no information about the other player's tendencies or strategies.\n4. In a single round with no prior information, any choice is equally valid from a game theory perspective.\n5. Studies show that in the first round of rock-paper-scissors, people slightly favor rock as their opening move.\n6. Knowing this psychological tendency, paper would be a slightly better strategic choice.\n7. However, the advantage is minimal and the opponent could just as easily choose scissors or paper.\n8. Given the limited information, I'll select paper as my move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper\n\n[move] Paper\n",
        "I'll think step-by-step about my rock-paper-scissors strategy.\n\nSteps:\n1. I need to make a move in rock-paper-scissors against a new player.\n2. Since this is our first interaction, I don't have any prior data on their strategy or patterns.\n3. In the absence of information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal expected value.\n4. However, studies show that in the first round, people tend to choose rock slightly more often.\n5. Therefore, choosing paper might give me a slight statistical edge.\n6. If I choose paper: I win against rock (+1), lose against scissors (-1), tie against paper (0).\n7. The expected value is still balanced, but with a small psychological advantage.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this first round.\n\n[move] paper\n",

I'm playing against a fresh player, which means we haven't played before and I don't have prior data on their strategy.\n\n2. In rock-paper-scissors without prior information, no single move has a theoretical advantage. Each move has a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tying.\n\n3. Since I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to make an unpredictable choice.\n\n4. Many first-time players tend to choose rock as their first move since it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\" However, this is just a tendency, not a certainty.\n\n5. If my opponent is thinking strategically, they might anticipate this tendency and choose paper to counter the expected rock.\n\n6. Given this reasoning, I could choose scissors to counter their potential paper. However, this is getting into multiple layers of prediction without data.\n\n7. Without reliable information, my best strategy is to choose randomly among the three options to be unpredictable.\n\n8. I'll choose paper for this round, which will win against rock, lose to scissors, and tie with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n",

Since I'm told this is a fresh player with no prior history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n3. In the absence of information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal 1/3 probability of winning.\n4. Some psychology research suggests that rock is a slightly more common first move for many players, but this is not reliable.\n5.

This suggests that we both might be following some sort of cyclical pattern, either intentionally or unintentionally.\n7. If my opponent recognizes this pattern, they might expect me to start my cycle over with paper.\n8. After eight straight losses, the opponent is likely in one of these mindsets:\n   a) Complete randomization to break their losing streak\n   b) Trying to identify and counter my pattern\n   c) Reverting to basic, predictable moves due to frustration\n9. Given their recent paper play and their observed tendency to change moves after losing, they're most likely to play rock next.\n10. If they've noticed my paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors cycle, they might play scissors expecting me to play paper.\n11. Weighing these possibilities, rock is their most probable next move as it both breaks their recent paper play and would counter my potential scissors play if I were to continue a cycle.\n12.
