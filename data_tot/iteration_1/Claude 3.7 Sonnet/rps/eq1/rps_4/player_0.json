    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

            "text": "I'll approach this rock-paper-scissors game strategically by collaborating with helpful personas.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Pattern Analyst, Psychological Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: In rock-paper-scissors, there is no dominant strategy when playing against a rational opponent. Since we're playing against a fresh player with no established patterns, we need to consider basic game theory principles. In single-shot RPS games, all three options are equally viable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no pattern data to analyze yet. However, studies show that rock is often the most common first move among novice players, with roughly 35-40% of players choosing it initially. Paper would be a reasonable counter.\n\nPsychological Strategist: First moves in RPS often reveal psychological tendencies. Many players choose rock as their first move because it represents strength and stability. Some players might anticipate this and choose paper instead. Given we have no information about our opponent, a strategically sound first move would be paper to counter the most common opening move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with the psychological assessment. While theoretically all moves are equal in a single instance, empirical evidence suggests rock is indeed overrepresented in opening moves. Paper would give us a slight edge.\n\nPattern Analyst: As we progress through rounds, I'll help analyze any patterns that might emerge in the opponent's play. For now, paper seems like a reasonable opening choice based on statistical tendencies.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Let's go with paper for this first move. We can adjust our strategy based on the opponent's response in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Our prediction was correct - the opponent chose rock in the first round, and we won with paper. Now we need to consider how they might adjust their strategy.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing with rock, many players will shift to the move that would have beaten their opponent's previous move. Since we played paper, there's a higher probability they'll switch to scissors to counter our paper.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with that assessment. This is often called the \"win-stay, lose-shift\" heuristic in repeated games. Since our opponent lost, they're likely to shift their strategy. If they follow basic pattern psychology, they'll likely play scissors next to beat our previous paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: The most strategic counter would be to play rock now, anticipating their scissors. However, we should be careful not to be too predictable ourselves.\n\nPsychological Strategist: There's also a smaller chance they might stick with rock, thinking we wouldn't expect that after their loss. But the strongest probability based on psychological patterns is that they'll switch to scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given all considerations, rock appears to be our optimal move for this round. It protects against the most likely scissors play while maintaining unpredictability in our own strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The opponent shifted to scissors after losing with rock, and we countered perfectly with rock. Now we need to analyze what they might do next.\n\nGame Theorist: We've won twice in a row now. Looking at the opponent's pattern, they've played rock \u2192 scissors, which suggests they're using the \"lose-shift\" strategy - changing their move after a loss to what would have beaten their previous move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given this pattern and our consecutive wins, the opponent is likely feeling pressure to break their losing streak. If they continue the \"lose-shift\" pattern, they would play paper next (to beat our rock). However, they might also try to outthink us by anticipating that we'll switch to paper (to beat their expected rock).\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's analyze the possibilities:\n1. If they follow the lose-shift pattern: They'll play paper to beat our rock\n2. If they try to be one step ahead: They might play scissors anticipating we'll play paper\n3. If they try to break their own pattern: They might play rock again\n\nGame Theorist: Given these considerations, scissors would be our optimal move. It would beat their paper if they follow the lose-shift pattern, and it would tie if they try to outthink us with scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Scissors is the strongest move here.

The opponent broke their pattern and played rock again. Let's review what we know:\nRound 1: Opponent played rock, we played paper (we won)\nRound 2: Opponent played scissors, we played rock (we won)\nRound 3: Opponent played rock again, we played scissors (we lost)\n\nGame Theorist: This suggests the opponent might be employing a more complex strategy than we initially thought. They've now used the sequence rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, which could indicate they're using a cyclical pattern or they've realized we were reading their moves and deliberately changed their approach.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After winning with rock in the last round, they might be inclined to stick with it (\"win-stay\" principle). However, they might also anticipate that we'll play paper to counter their rock, and switch to scissors. The key insight is that they've returned to rock after being beaten when they played it initially.\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent seems to be adapting more strategically now. They might be trying to establish a false pattern to mislead us. Given they've played rock twice out of three rounds, they may favor it.\n\nGame Theorist: Given all this information, paper would be the optimal move for this round. It beats rock if they stick with it, and if they anticipate our paper and play scissors, we'd lose - but that's a calculated risk based on their demonstrated preference for rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with paper. The opponent has shown a preference for rock (2 out of 3 rounds), and after winning with it, there's psychological reinforcement to continue with a winning move. Paper is our best strategic choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They haven't played paper at all, which is significant. If they continue this alternating pattern, they should play rock next.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent has won the last two rounds using this alternating strategy. Psychologically, they're likely to continue with what's working for them. Given their pattern and recent success, rock seems highly probable for their next move.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The alternating rock-scissors pattern is strong, and they've avoided paper completely. This suggests either a strategic preference or possibly even a psychological aversion to playing paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Based on the clear alternating pattern and their avoidance of paper, we should play paper next to counter their expected rock move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: There's always the possibility they might break their pattern now that they've established it so clearly, but the strongest evidence points to them playing rock next in their alternating sequence.

This is crucial information. They may have recognized that we identified their pattern and adjusted accordingly.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After establishing a pattern and then breaking it, players often revert to a new pattern or try something completely unexpected. Given that they've now used paper for the first time, they might:\n1. Start a new alternating pattern with paper (paper \u2192 ?)\n2. Return to their previous pattern (back to rock)\n3.

Looking at their last three moves (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), they appear to be cycling through all three options in a systematic way.

If they continue this logical sequence, rock would be next. Additionally, looking at their overall game, they've played rock 3 times, scissors 3 times, and paper only once, showing a preference for rock and scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After winning their last round with scissors, they might be tempted to stay with a winning move.

Their last four moves show paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, which doesn't follow a simple cycle. However, if we look at pairs of moves, there's an interesting pattern: after playing paper, they've played rock (rounds 5\u21926) and potentially now; after rock, they've played scissors (rounds 1\u21922, 3\u21924, 6\u21927); after scissors, they've played both rock (rounds 2\u21923) and paper (rounds 4\u21925, 7\u21928).\n\nPsychological Strategist: After another tie, they might be trying to gain an advantage. Looking at their overall pattern, they've played rock 3 times, scissors 3 times, and paper now 2 times. The most recent pattern suggests they might be establishing a new cycle.\n\nPattern Analyst: If we focus on what follows paper in their sequence, they played rock after paper in round 5\u21926. This would suggest rock as their likely next move.\n\nGame Theorist: However, we need to consider that they might be adapting to our moves as well. Given that we've just had a tie with paper, they might anticipate we'll switch to scissors to beat their expected rock, and therefore they might play rock to beat our scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is getting complex with multiple layers of anticipation. Given the tie with paper and their historical tendency to play rock after paper, I believe scissors is our best move here. It would beat their paper if they repeat it, and if they play rock as their pattern suggests, we would lose - but the strongest evidence points to them not repeating paper immediately after using it.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Looking at their complete sequence, they haven't repeated the same move in consecutive rounds at any point in the game. This strongly suggests they won't play paper again, making scissors a strategically sound choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They've now played rock 4 times, scissors 3 times, and paper 2 times, showing a preference for rock. Looking at their most recent moves, they played paper \u2192 rock, which matches what they did in rounds 5\u21926.\n\nPattern Analyst: There's a notable pattern in how they follow rock moves. After playing rock, they've played:\n- scissors (rounds 1\u21922)\n- scissors (rounds 3\u21924) \n- scissors (rounds 6\u21927)\nThis suggests that after playing rock, they have a strong tendency to play scissors next.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After winning the last round with rock, they might feel confident and stick with that winning strategy. However, their established pattern of following rock with scissors is quite strong (3 out of 3 previous instances).\n\nGame Theorist: Given their consistent pattern of playing scissors after rock, and the fact they just played rock, the highest probability move from them would be scissors. We should counter with rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: I strongly agree. The pattern of them playing scissors after rock has been consistent throughout the entire game. This is our strongest predictive signal so far.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I also agree with playing rock. While there's always a chance they break their pattern, the evidence for them playing scissors after rock is compelling and has held true throughout all previous rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Looking at what follows after they play scissors:\n- After scissors in round 2, they played rock (round 3)\n- After scissors in round 4, they played paper (round 5)\n- After scissors in round 7, they played paper (round 8)\n- Now after scissors in round 10, what will they play?\n\nPattern Analyst: In their most recent patterns, scissors has been followed by paper twice (rounds 4\u21925 and 7\u21928), versus rock once (rounds 2\u21923) which was earlier in the game. This suggests paper is more likely.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing the last round, they might switch strategies. Their overall pattern shows they've played rock 4 times, scissors 4 times, and paper 2 times. They might be due for another paper play based on both their recent tendency to follow scissors with paper and the overall distribution of their moves.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that paper is their most likely next move. It's consistent with their recent pattern of following scissors with paper, and it would also counter our rock from the previous round if they think we might repeat it after winning.\n\nPattern Analyst: Another observation: throughout the game, they've never played the same move three times in a row (e.g., never rock-rock-rock or scissors-scissors-scissors). Since they've just played scissors and before that rock, paper completes their typical cycle.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given all these factors, scissors would be our optimal move to counter their likely paper play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Previously, they consistently followed paper with rock, but this time they played scissors after paper. This suggests they might be adapting to our strategy or deliberately breaking their patterns.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing two rounds in a row, they likely felt pressure to change their predictable patterns.

However, they broke this pattern in the most recent paper\u2192scissors transition. This makes the prediction less certain.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing again, they might revert to their more established patterns or try something completely different.

They're now actively breaking their established patterns to be less predictable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at what follows after they play paper:\n- After paper in round 5, they played rock (round 6)\n- After paper in round 8, they played rock (round 9)\n- After paper in round 11, they played scissors (round 12)\n- After paper in round 13, they played rock (round 14)\n- Now after paper in round 15, what will they play?\n\nGame Theorist: Their pattern after paper has been mostly rock (3/4 instances), with scissors occurring once.

After paper, they've typically played rock (5/6 instances), but this time they played scissors. This suggests they might be adapting to our successful predictions.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing six rounds in a row, they likely felt extreme pressure to change their strategy. They've now broken one of their most consistent patterns, which indicates they're trying to become less predictable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at what follows after they play scissors:\n- After scissors in round 2, they played rock (round 3)\n- After scissors in round 4, they played paper (round 5)\n- After scissors in round 7, they played paper (round 8)\n- After scissors in round 10, they played paper (round 11)\n- After scissors in round 12, they played paper (round 13)\n- After scissors in round 17, they played paper (round 18)\n- After scissors in round 20, they played paper (round 21)\n- Now after scissors in round 22, what will they play?\n\nGame Theorist: Their pattern after scissors has strongly favored paper (6/7 instances), with rock occurring only once early in the game. Despite their recent pattern break with paper\u2192scissors, their scissors\u2192paper pattern has remained extremely consistent.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given they just broke one pattern but finally won a round after a long losing streak, they might be encouraged to continue mixing up their strategy. However, their scissors\u2192paper pattern has been their most consistent throughout the game.\n\nPattern Analyst: I believe paper remains their most likely next move after scissors, based on the strong historical evidence (6/7 instances). However, we should acknowledge the increased uncertainty after they demonstrated willingness to break patterns.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering all factors, scissors remains our optimal move to counter their most likely paper play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

However, their most recent paper\u2192scissors transition suggests they might be changing their strategy.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing again after a brief win, they might revert to more established patterns or continue trying to be unpredictable. The recency of their paper\u2192scissors break is significant.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a challenging prediction. Their historical tendency strongly favors rock after paper, but they just recently broke this pattern. If they're establishing a new pattern, they might play scissors again. If they're being deliberately unpredictable, they could play anything.\n\nPattern Analyst: Another consideration: they've played paper 8 times, scissors 8 times, and rock 7 times. From a balance perspective, rock is slightly \"due\" compared to the other moves.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given all factors, including their historical paper\u2192rock tendency, their recent pattern break, and the balance of their moves, I still believe rock is their most likely next move. They may view their recent pattern break as a one-time adjustment rather than a new strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that rock remains the most probable next move, despite the increased uncertainty.

They've now played paper\u2192scissors twice in a row, breaking away from their earlier paper\u2192rock pattern. This suggests they're adapting their strategy.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After winning with scissors twice recently, they might be gaining confidence in that move. Their overall strategy seems to be evolving.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at what follows after they play scissors:\n- After scissors in round 2, they played rock (round 3)\n- After scissors in round 4, they played paper (round 5)\n- After scissors in round 7, they played paper (round 8)\n- After scissors in round 10, they played paper (round 11)\n- After scissors in round 12, they played paper (round 13)\n- After scissors in round 17, they played paper (round 18)\n- After scissors in round 20, they played paper (round 21)\n- After scissors in round 22, they played paper (round 23)\n- Now after scissors in round 24, what will they play?\n\nGame Theorist: Their pattern after scissors has strongly favored paper (7/8 instances), with rock occurring only once early in the game.

They've now played scissors\u2192rock instead of their usual scissors\u2192paper. This is a significant strategic shift.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After winning with scissors against our paper, they might have anticipated we would adjust to their scissors\u2192paper pattern and played rock instead. They're becoming more sophisticated in their counter-strategy.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at what follows after they play rock:\n- After rock in round 1, they played scissors (round 2)\n- After rock in round 3, they played scissors (round 4)\n- After rock in round 6, they played scissors (round 7)\n- After rock in round 9, they played scissors (round 10)\n- After rock in round 14, they played paper (round 15)\n- After rock in round 16, they played scissors (round 17)\n- After rock in round 19, they played scissors (round 20)\n- Now after rock in round 25, what will they play?\n\nGame Theorist: Their pattern after rock has strongly favored scissors (6/7 instances), with paper occurring only once.

They appear to be deliberately breaking their established patterns.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After winning by breaking patterns, they're likely gaining confidence in this anti-pattern strategy.

This suggests they might be transitioning to a new paper\u2192scissors pattern.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given their success with breaking patterns and their recent tendency to play scissors after paper, scissors seems more likely than their historical tendency toward rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: The recency effect is important here.

Given their recent pattern-breaking behavior, prediction becomes more challenging.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing the last round, they might revert to more established patterns or continue their anti-pattern strategy. Their overall behavior suggests they're trying to be less predictable.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a complex situation. Their historical tendency strongly favors paper after scissors, but they recently broke this pattern. If they're establishing a new pattern, they might play rock again. If they're being deliberately unpredictable, they could play anything.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their recent behavior, they seem to be breaking established patterns after we successfully predict them multiple times. Since they just lost with scissors, they might revert to their more established scissors\u2192paper pattern.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I think paper remains their most likely move, despite the increased unpredictability. They've shown a strong preference for this transition throughout the game, and even with their recent pattern breaking, this remains their statistical favorite.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering all factors, scissors remains our optimal move to counter their most likely paper play, while acknowledging the increased uncertainty.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Earlier in the game, it strongly favored rock (5/6 in the first instances), but recently it has shifted to scissors (3 consecutive paper\u2192scissors transitions). This suggests scissors is now their most likely move after paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing two rounds in a row, they might be inclined to change their strategy again. However, their recent consistent paper\u2192scissors pattern suggests they've established a new pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their recent consistent paper\u2192scissors transitions, scissors seems to be their most likely next move. We should counter with rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. While their overall paper\u2192rock vs paper\u2192scissors ratio is 5:5, the recency effect is important here. Their last three paper transitions have all been to scissors, suggesting a clear new pattern.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I also agree with playing rock. Their recent behavior shows a clear shift to a paper\u2192scissors pattern, and after consecutive losses, they're more likely to stick with what has become their new established pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This double paper play breaks all their previous tendencies.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at what follows after they play paper:\n- After paper in round 5, they played rock (round 6)\n- After paper in round 8, they played rock (round 9)\n- After paper in round 11, they played scissors (round 12)\n- After paper in round 13, they played rock (round 14)\n- After paper in round 15, they played rock (round 16)\n- After paper in round 18, they played rock (round 19)\n- After paper in round 21, they played scissors (round 22)\n- After paper in round 23, they played scissors (round 24)\n- After paper in round 26, they played scissors (round 27)\n- After paper in round 28, they played paper (round 29)\n- Now after paper in round 29, what will they play?\n\nGame Theorist: This is now much more difficult to predict. They've broken their pattern consistency by playing paper twice in a row. Their overall distribution is now rock (8 times), scissors (10 times), and paper (11 times).\n\nPattern Analyst: Given they've just played paper twice in a row (something they've never done before), and their historical tendency after paper has been either rock or scissors, I think they're least likely to play paper a third time. Between rock and scissors, their recent pattern before the double paper favored scissors after paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This could be a deliberate attempt to confuse us. After winning with an unexpected paper, they might return to more established patterns. Given their historical tendencies and overall distribution, scissors seems more likely than rock (as they've played scissors more often than rock overall).\n\nGame Theorist: Considering all factors, including their historical patterns after paper, their overall move distribution, and the psychological aspects of having just broken a pattern, rock would be our safest move. It would beat their scissors if they play that, and tie with their rock if they revert to that pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"
