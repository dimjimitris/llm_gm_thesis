Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

After winning with paper, my opponent has a few common options:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (status quo bias)\n   - They might anticipate me switching to paper (to beat their previous rock) and thus choose scissors\n   - They might completely randomize to be unpredictable\n4.

At this point, I need to try something radically different.\n7. One approach I haven't tried is to directly copy my opponent's previous move.\n8. This strategy, called \"copy-last,\" can sometimes be effective against opponents who are trying to anticipate complex patterns.\n9. By playing what they just played, I:\n   - Avoid any complex reasoning they might be anticipating\n   - Create a simple pattern that might disrupt their prediction algorithm\n   - Force them to either tie (by repeating their move) or develop a counter to their own previous move\n10. My opponent just played scissors, so following this strategy, I would play scissors.\n11. While this isn't guaranteed to work, it represents a completely different approach from what I've tried so far.\n12. Given that all my other strategies have failed, this simple approach might be worth trying.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round, copying my opponent's last move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

            "text": "I won with my new \"lose-to-opponent\" strategy! I'll continue with this approach.\n\nSteps:\n1. My opponent's moves so far: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n2. My moves so far: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n3. My counter-intuitive \"lose-to-opponent\" strategy just worked.\n4. Their move distribution is now: paper (11), rock (10), and scissors (8) out of 29 rounds.\n5. Since this new strategy was successful, I'll continue with it.\n6. My opponent just played rock, so what would lose to rock is scissors.\n7. This \"lose-to-opponent\" strategy:\n   - Creates a pattern that seems illogical but might be effective precisely because of that\n   - Could continue to work if my opponent is trying to anticipate more conventional strategies\n   - Might be hard for them to identify quickly since it's counter-intuitive\n8. My opponent might be confused by this approach since it doesn't follow traditional game theory.\n9. Given that it just worked after several losses with other strategies, I'll stick with it for at least another round.\n10. This strategy also has the advantage of being simple to implement while potentially being difficult for my opponent to predict.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round, playing what would lose to my opponent's previous move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
