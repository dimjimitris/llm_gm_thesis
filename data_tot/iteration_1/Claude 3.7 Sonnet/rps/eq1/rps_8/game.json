My opponent has now played scissors twice (once beating my paper, once losing to my rock). Their established pattern shows they tend to repeat moves multiple times before switching (5 papers, 3 rocks previously). Based on this pattern, there's a high probability they'll play scissors at least once more before changing tactics. Rock remains the optimal counter to their expected scissors play. If they do switch to paper, I'll adapt in the next round, but their historical behavior suggests continued scissors play is more likely.\n",

My opponent has now played scissors twice in a row, following their pattern of playing the same move multiple times (previously 5 papers, then 3 rocks).

        "Perfect! My rock has now beaten their scissors three times in a row, matching their previous pattern length with rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n\nI'll continue with rock for this round. My opponent has played scissors three consecutive times now, which matches the length of their previous rock sequence but is still shorter than their paper sequence (5 times). Their pattern shows variable-length repetitions, but they consistently repeat moves before switching. Since they've shown they can repeat moves beyond three times (as they did with paper), there's still a reasonable probability they'll play scissors again. Rock remains the optimal strategic choice against their expected scissors. I'll be prepared to switch if they adapt to paper.\n",

They've maintained their pattern of triple repetition for their last two moves (3 rocks, now 3 scissors).\n\n[move] Rock\n\nI'll continue with rock for this round. My opponent's pattern has become clearer: they played 5 papers initially, then settled into playing each move 3 times (3 rocks, 3 scissors so far). While they might switch to paper after 3 scissors based on this pattern, there's also precedent for them extending beyond 3 repetitions (as they did with paper). Given this analysis, rock remains the strategic choice with the highest probability of success. If they do switch to paper, I'll immediately adapt in the next round.\n",
