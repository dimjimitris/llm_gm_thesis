    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For identifying potential patterns and psychological aspects\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward trade-offs\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their playing style. In game theory, when facing uncertainty, it's often best to start with a balanced approach.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Without any historical data, we can't predict patterns yet. However, psychologically, many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that observation, we could counter with paper. However, if we're wrong, we risk losing to scissors. Each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing in a purely random scenario.\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is our first move and we have no prior information, I suggest we go with paper. It counters the common \"rock\" opening, and even if we lose to scissors, we'll gain valuable information about our opponent's style.\n\nPattern Analyst: I support this decision. Paper is also psychologically seen as less aggressive than rock or scissors, which might give us an advantage in reading the opponent's response in subsequent rounds.\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. The potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper This is a strategic opening move, considering that many players tend to start with rock.\n"

Now we need to consider if our opponent will adapt their strategy after losing.\n\nPattern Analyst: After losing with rock, players often exhibit one of two behaviors:\n1. They might stick to rock, believing we wouldn't expect them to use the same losing move\n2. More commonly, they might try to counter our previous winning move (paper) by using scissors\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has shown a conventional opening with rock. This suggests they might be using basic strategy, making the second scenario (switching to scissors) more likely.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. After losing, most players tend to adjust their strategy rather than repeat a losing move. Since we used paper and won, they are likely to expect us to use paper again and will try to counter with scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: Therefore, we should counter their expected scissors with rock. This plays into basic human psychology of adaptation and counter-strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: The risk of them sticking with rock is present but lower than the probability of them switching to scissors. I support the rock move as it protects against the most likely scenario.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's proceed with rock. If we're wrong, we'll gain more information about their pattern recognition and adaptation style.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on probability of opponent switching to scissors to counter our previous paper move.\n"

We correctly predicted they wouldn't use scissors, but they matched our rock instead of using their previous strategy.\n\nPattern Analyst: The tie with rock reveals something important - our opponent might be playing more conservatively now. After losing with rock, then switching to rock again, there's a psychological tendency to want to \"break\" this rock pattern.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n1. They might stick with rock for a third time (least likely after two rock moves)\n2. They might try to beat our expected rock with paper (quite likely)\n3. They might try to be unpredictable and use scissors (moderate probability)\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we've seen rock twice from them, and the last round was a tie, they're likely feeling pressure to change their strategy. The most logical choice for them would be paper to beat the rock pattern.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The psychology of rock-paper-scissors often shows that players feel uncomfortable using the same move three times in a row, especially after a tie. The pressure to win often leads to choosing the move that would have won the previous round.\n\nRisk Manager: If we predict they'll use paper, we should counter with scissors. The risk of them using rock for a third time is low, and if they use scissors, it would be a less likely scenario given the psychological factors at play.\n\nGame Strategist: Scissors is our best move here. It covers the most probable scenario (them using paper) and plays into the psychological aspects of the game.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Anticipating opponent will break their rock pattern with paper after two consecutive rock moves.\n"

The fact that we both switched from rock to scissors in the last round suggests our opponent might be thinking along similar strategic lines.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we've both shown adaptability and similar thinking patterns, we need to break this synchronization. Instead of trying to predict their next logical move, we might need to make a less obvious choice.\n\nPattern Analyst: Psychologically, after scissors, many players tend to choose rock as it feels \"strong\" against the previous scissors move. However, since we've both shown higher-level thinking, they might anticipate this and choose paper to beat the expected rock.\n\nRisk Manager: This is becoming a complex mind game. Since they've matched our last two moves, they might be trying to read our pattern. We need to be unpredictable here.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we use paper. Here's why:\n1. If they go with the obvious rock to beat last round's scissors, we win\n2. If they try to be clever and use scissors again, we lose but break the tie pattern\n3. If they try to outthink us and use paper, we tie but gain more information\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree.

Our opponent appears to be either:\n1. Extremely good at reading our strategy\n2. Following very similar logical patterns to ours\n3. Possibly using a mirroring strategy after the first round\n\nRisk Manager: The three consecutive ties suggest we need to dramatically change our approach. Continuing with logical progression is becoming predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: After paper, the logical progression would be scissors to counter expected paper, or rock to counter expected scissors. But given our opponent's demonstrated ability to match our moves, we need to break this mirror effect.\n\nPattern Analyst: The psychological pressure of three consecutive ties is significant. Both players will feel a strong urge to break this pattern. In such situations, players often resort to their \"comfort move\" or go for what they consider the \"strongest\" move - which is often rock.\n\nRisk Manager: However, if they're thinking at the same level we are, they might anticipate us thinking this way and choose paper to beat the expected rock. Or they might choose scissors to beat the expected paper.\n\nGame Strategist: We need to break this cycle. Instead of trying to outthink each level of logic, let's use rock for two reasons:\n1. It's the most straightforward move after paper, which makes it almost too obvious to be expected\n2. The very obviousness of it might make it unexpected at this level of play\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Sometimes in complex game theory, the most basic move becomes the most unexpected one. This is known as the \"first-level thinking paradox\" where high-level players occasionally revert to basic strategies to break patterns.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Using apparent simplicity as a strategy breaker after multiple ties and complex mind games.\n"

The opponent has shown they can not only mirror our moves but also break the pattern to their advantage. They've demonstrated sophisticated strategy by using paper against our attempt to break the pattern with rock.\n\nRisk Manager: We're now at a negative score (-1), which means we need to be especially careful. The opponent has proven they can:\n1. Mirror our moves effectively\n2. Break patterns strategically\n3. Possibly predict our attempt at pattern-breaking\n\nGame Strategist: After winning with paper, they might:\n1. Stick with their winning move (paper)\n2.

This suggests they might have been trying to establish a pattern to trap us, but we broke it successfully.\n\nRisk Manager: After losing with their third paper play, they're almost certainly going to change their move. The question is whether they'll play:\n1. Rock - as a \"reset\" move after a loss\n2. Scissors - trying to predict that we might stick with our winning move\n3. Paper - an unlikely fourth repeat\n\nGame Strategist: Given their sophisticated play earlier in the game (matching our moves, breaking patterns), they're likely to assume we'll either:\n- Stick with our winning scissors move\n- Switch to rock anticipating their scissors\n\nPattern Analyst: The psychology after losing to scissors is particularly interesting. Most players feel vulnerable to staying with paper but also feel that scissors is too obvious. This often leads to a rock play as it feels secure and beats the move that just defeated them.\n\nRisk Manager: Their pattern of sophisticated play followed by three paper moves suggests they might be mixing strategic levels - sometimes playing very advanced, sometimes more basic. After this loss, they might revert to a more basic strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest we use paper. Here's why:\n1. It beats the psychologically probable rock\n2.

They've won four of the last five rounds and have shown they can:\n1. Anticipate our pattern-breaking attempts\n2. Switch strategies effectively\n3. Use our desperation against us\n4. Successfully bait us into unfavorable moves\n\nRisk Manager: At -3 points, we're in a critical situation. Their last move (rock) was particularly clever as it:\n1. Countered our aggressive scissors play\n2. Showed they anticipated our attempt to break patterns\n3. Further strengthened their psychological advantage\n\nGame Strategist: After winning with rock, they might:\n1. Stick with rock, expecting us to avoid paper due to our recent losses\n2. Switch to paper, anticipating we might use rock as a \"reset\"\n3. Use scissors, expecting us to try paper to counter their rock\n\nPattern Analyst: Psychologically, players with a strong lead often:\n1. Play more conservatively to protect their lead\n2. Continue with what's working (rock just worked)\n3. Try to finish strongly with an aggressive move\n\nRisk Manager: Given our position, we need to make a move that has the best chance of success while accepting that we're playing against a very skilled opponent.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest paper for these reasons:\n1. If they're feeling confident and stick with their winning rock move, we win\n2. If they try to end strongly with scissors, we lose but at least we played the most logical counter to their last winning move\n3. If they use paper, we tie and deny them another win\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Paper is our best option because:\n1. It shows we're still playing logically despite our losses\n2.

Become slightly overconfident\n3. Try to prove their superiority with a complex strategy\n\nRisk Manager: Given our desperate position, we need to break their momentum while protecting against further losses.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest rock for these reasons:\n1. It directly counters their recent scissors plays\n2. It's a strong defensive move when we're significantly behind\n3. If they're getting overconfident with scissors, we can punish that\n4. Even if they counter with paper, we've shown we're still playing logically\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Rock also has psychological value here:\n1. It shows we're not tilting despite our losses\n2.

This triple paper sequence is similar to their earlier strategy in rounds 4-6. Last time after we broke their paper sequence with scissors, they countered with scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: We're still at -4 points, but breaking their winning streak is significant. After losing with a third consecutive paper play, they might:\n1. Switch to rock as a \"reset\" move (like they did last time after losing to scissors)\n2. Try scissors to counter our potential paper play\n3. Use paper again, though this seems unlikely after three papers\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated high-level play throughout the game, they'll likely expect us to:\n1. Stay with our winning scissors move\n2. Switch to paper expecting their rock\n3. Use rock to counter their potential scissors\n\nPattern Analyst: Psychologically, after having their streak broken, players often:\n1. Return to basics (rock)\n2. Try to immediately regain control with an aggressive move\n3. Attempt to bait the opponent into repeating their successful move\n\nRisk Manager: Given the history and their sophisticated play, rock would be their most strategic move here - it would beat our winning scissors if we repeat it, and it's a strong reset move after losing.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest paper for these reasons:\n1. It beats the psychologically and strategically probable rock\n2. It avoids the trap of repeating our winning move\n3.

We've had another tie with matching rocks\n2. They've moved from paper streak to rock plays\n3. We're still at -6 points\n4. The game continues to show high-level strategy\n\nRisk Manager: After the rock-rock tie:\n1. Both players will feel pressure to break the tie\n2. They've shown they can read our pattern-breaking attempts\n3. They might expect us to counter their rock\n\nGame Strategist: Their most likely moves are:\n1. Paper to beat our potential rock repeat\n2. Scissors to counter our expected paper\n3. Rock again to maintain the psychological pressure\n\nPattern Analyst: Psychologically:\n1. After a tie, players often want to win the next round\n2. They've consistently outthought our strategies\n3. They might expect us to make the obvious paper play\n4. The tie creates additional strategic complexity\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest scissors for these reasons:\n1. It counters the likely paper play (them expecting us to use paper to beat rock)\n2. It breaks from the obvious paper counter to rock\n3. If they use rock again, we lose but we avoided the obvious trap\n4. It shows we can think multiple levels ahead\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Scissors also:\n1. Takes an aggressive stance after the tie\n2. Anticipates their likely counter to our expected paper\n3. Shows we've learned from their strategic baiting\n\nRisk Manager: While paper might seem logical after rock, they've consistently punished obvious moves throughout the game.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Making an aggressive play that anticipates their paper counter to our expected paper, while accepting the risk of another rock play.\n"
