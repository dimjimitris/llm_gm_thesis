In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information:\n   - Rock, paper, and scissors each have an equal 1/3 probability of being played\n   - No move has an inherent advantage\n\n3. Since there's no historical data to base a decision on, I need to consider:\n   - Rock is often a common first move for many players as it feels \"strong\"\n   - However, anticipating this, some players might choose paper\n   - This creates a circular reasoning pattern\n\n4. In this situation of complete uncertainty:\n   - Making an unpredictable move is important\n   - Any move is theoretically equally valid\n   - Over-thinking might lead to predictability\n\n5. I will choose paper because:\n   - It can counter the common \"first-move rock\" tendency\n   - It's slightly less commonly chosen as a first move\n   - Even if I'm wrong, it's not worse than any other choice in this situation\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In this situation of complete uncertainty:\n   - Making an unpredictable move is important\n   - Any move is theoretically equally valid\n   - Over-thinking might lead to predictability\n\n5. I will choose paper because:\n   - It can counter the common \"first-move rock\" tendency\n   - It's slightly less commonly chosen as a first move\n   - Even if I'm wrong, it's not worse than any other choice in this situation\n\n[move] paper\n",

Common strategy suggests rock is often chosen first by many players\n   - Players tend to choose rock as first move because it feels \"strong\" and \"safe\"\n5. To counter this tendency, paper would be a strategic first move\n   - If they play rock, I win\n   - If they play paper, it's a tie\n   - If they play scissors, I lose\n6.

Without any historical data, all moves are equally viable:\n   - Each move wins against one option\n   - Each move loses against one option\n   - Each move ties against itself\n\n4. In game theory, when all options have equal expected value and there's no prior information, a random choice is often optimal to avoid being predictable.\n\n5. In many cases, new players tend to choose rock as their first move (as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\"), but this is not reliable enough information to base my decision on.\n\n6.

Without any additional information, there's no mathematical advantage to any particular move.\n\n4.
