Pattern insights:\n   - They're now showing three consecutive rock plays\n   - Similar to their earlier scissors pattern (5 in a row)\n   - They've demonstrated they're willing to maintain patterns\n   - But we know they eventually break patterns strategically\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - They might be replicating their earlier scissors strategy with rock\n   - Three ties in recent rounds shows synchronized thinking\n   - Both players are deeply engaged in the meta-game\n   - The predictability of their rock plays feels intentional\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - After three rock plays, they might:\n   - Continue rock pattern as they did with scissors\n   - Expect me to finally play paper to counter rock\n   - Switch to scissors expecting my paper counter\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll stick with rock\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given their history of using long patterns as traps\n   - And our recent mirror plays\n   - And their demonstrated sophisticated strategy\n   - They likely expect me to finally break and play paper\n   - Therefore, they'll probably switch to scissors to punish this paper play\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for the fourth time. While it seems overly simple, they're likely expecting me to overthink and finally play paper to counter their rock pattern, which they would counter with scissors. By maintaining rock, I either tie with their rock or beat their scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Complete game history analysis:\n   - Early: Long scissors pattern (5 plays)\n   - Recent: FOUR consecutive rock-rock ties\n   - Their sequence: paper \u2192 scissors(\u00d75) \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n2. Pattern insights:\n   - We're now mirroring each other with rock for 4 straight rounds\n   - This mirrors their earlier scissors strategy, but with ties\n   - The symmetry is remarkable - they did 5 scissors, now 4 rocks\n   - The mind game has reached a deep level of mutual prediction\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - We're both showing extreme patience\n   - They proved with scissors they'll break patterns at the perfect moment\n   - The fourth tie might create pressure to break the stalemate\n   - This feels like a psychological endurance test\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - Key question: Will they break the pattern at 4 rocks, or push to 5?\n   - Their scissors pattern went to 5 before breaking\n   - They might expect me to finally break and play paper\n   - They might break now because we're anticipating 5\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Critical factors:\n   * Their history of 5-move patterns\n   * The mounting pressure of ties\n   * The mutual awareness of pattern-breaking\n   * Their proven ability to set and break patterns\n   - If I play rock: I tie with rock, beat scissors\n   - If I play paper: I beat rock, lose to scissors\n   - If I play scissors: I lose to rock, beat paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to paper. Here's why: They've shown their patterns break at strategic moments. Four consecutive rock ties creates immense pressure to change. Their previous pattern went to 5, which makes breaking at 4 more surprising. They know I know their 5-pattern history, making 4 the perfect breaking point. Paper beats their likely continued rock play.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Here's why:\n- They're very likely to play paper because:\n  * It beats my successful rock play\n  * It's the logical counter to my recent wins\n  * They need to break their losing streak\n  * It's their safest play against my likely rock\n- Scissors beats their likely paper play\n- Even if they expect this scissors counter, paper is still their safest play\n- The game has become about immediate tactical counters rather than long patterns\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In this case, I need to consider the base game theory:\n   - Each move beats one option and loses to another\n   - All moves are equally viable in a single isolated round\n   - Without prior information, no move has inherent advantage\n\n3. Given complete uncertainty about opponent's strategy:\n   - Rock, paper, and scissors each have 1/3 probability of being optimal\n   - No move can be exploited in this first round\n   - Any move is equally rational\n\n4. I will choose rock because:\n   - It's a psychologically strong opening move\n   - Many players tend to choose scissors in their first move\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I win\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I can learn from this loss\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I can build on this tie\n\n[move] rock\n",

In such a situation with no prior information, any move is equally strategic.\n\n5. Given this is the first move, I'll choose rock as it's considered a common opening move since:\n   - It's seen as a \"strong\" gesture\n   - Many new players tend to choose scissors first\n   - Even if they choose paper, I can learn from this initial interaction\n\n[move] rock\n",
