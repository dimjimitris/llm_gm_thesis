    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior and identifying patterns\n3. Risk Assessor - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n4. Decision Maker (myself) - For making the final move decision\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their behavior or patterns. In such cases, game theory suggests that each move should have an equal probability (1/3) of being chosen to be unpredictable.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. With no historical data, we can't make any assumptions about the opponent's preferences or patterns. However, some studies suggest that \"rock\" is often a common first move choice among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nRisk Assessor: If we assume there's a slightly higher chance of the opponent choosing \"rock\" first, paper would give us the highest expected value. However, this is just a probabilistic advantage, not a certainty.\n\nGame Strategist: True, but we shouldn't overweight this initial tendency as it might lead to predictable play from our side. We should maintain unpredictability while slightly favoring paper.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on the discussion, I'll choose paper for this first move. It has a slight theoretical advantage against first-time players while maintaining a balanced strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

However, we need to consider that they might adapt their strategy after losing.\n\nPattern Analyzer: After losing with rock, there are two common psychological patterns we often see:\n1. Players might switch to what would have beaten their previous losing move (scissors would have beaten our paper)\n2. Players might switch to what beat them (paper beat their rock)\n\nRisk Assessor: Given these possibilities, the opponent is likely to change their move. Staying with paper would be risky as they might anticipate it and choose scissors. However, they might also overthink and choose paper themselves.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we use rock this time. Here's why:\n- If they switch to scissors (to beat our previous paper), we win\n- If they switch to paper (to copy our winning move), we lose\n- If they stick to rock (less likely after losing), we tie\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. Most players don't repeat a losing move immediately, and scissors is a common response to losing against paper. Rock would be a good counter to this potential adaptation.\n\nDecision Maker: The analysis makes sense. Let's go with rock to counter the most likely adaptation from our opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

Following this pattern, they might expect us to continue our winning streak with rock and try to counter it with paper. Also, after two losses, they might be more determined to win.\n\nRisk Assessor: The opponent has lost twice and might be becoming more predictable due to frustration. However, they might also be learning our pattern of successful counters. We need to stay one step ahead.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that:\n1. They might expect us to stick with rock (our last winning move)\n2. They've shown willingness to change strategies\n3. Paper would be their logical counter to our previous rock\nI suggest we switch to scissors to counter their likely paper play.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I concur. The psychological pressure of two losses often leads players to make more obvious counter-moves. Scissors would be an excellent choice to exploit their likely paper play.\n\nDecision Maker: The analysis is solid.

They've never repeated a move\n2. They've cycled through all three options once\n3. They appear to be trying to counter our previous winning move each time, but we've stayed one step ahead\n4. After three losses, they might be very frustrated and might change their strategy completely\n\nRisk Assessor: This is a critical moment. Three consecutive losses might cause them to:\n1. Break their pattern completely out of frustration\n2. Try to outsmart us by anticipating our next prediction\n3. Return to their first move (rock) as a reset strategy\n4. Finally realize we're predicting their moves and become truly random\n\nGame Strategist: Given these possibilities, we need to be more cautious. The opponent has likely realized their predictability. The safest play might be paper because:\n- If they return to their original rock play (which is common when players want to \"reset\")\n- If they try to overthink and use scissors (expecting us to use rock), we would only lose one win out of our three wins\n\nPattern Analyzer: I disagree slightly. I think they're most likely to use rock next - either as a reset strategy or because they might expect us to use paper (following their cycle). I suggest we use paper.\n\nDecision Maker: After considering all viewpoints, I agree with using paper. It's a balanced choice that protects against the most likely scenario of them returning to rock, while keeping our losses minimal if we're wrong.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

They might be setting up a trap by appearing predictable\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we break our own pattern here. Instead of trying to predict their next move, we should use a move that minimizes our potential loss. Rock would be a good choice because:\n- If they use scissors out of frustration (expecting us to use paper again), we win\n- If they use paper (trying to beat our previous winning pattern), we lose just one game out of five\n- If they use rock (becoming random), we tie\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree.

However, six straight losses should be enough to break anyone's pattern\n4. They might finally realize their perfect repetition\n\nRisk Assessor: This is an extremely critical moment:\n1. Six consecutive losses is psychologically devastating\n2. They must realize by now that they're being predictable\n3. The pattern is too perfect to continue\n4.

The opponent has likely realized their cyclical behavior. If they continue the pattern, they would play rock next, but that seems highly unlikely after six losses.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. The probability of them continuing this perfect cycle for a third time is extremely low. They're more likely to:\n1. Play paper again (stubbornness)\n2. Play scissors (to break pattern)\n3.

Their attempt at matching moves failed\n3. They seem to default back to predictable patterns under pressure\n4. This might be the breaking point where they finally play randomly\n\nGame Strategist: This is a key decision point:\n1. If they continue their original cycle, they'll play rock\n2. If they've finally learned, they'll play randomly\n3. They might try to double-bluff by appearing to return to their cycle\n\nPattern Analyzer: I believe they're most likely to abandon patterns entirely now. After so many losses and failed strategies, true randomization is their best option. However, under pressure, players often revert to their initial patterns unconsciously.\n\nDecision Maker: Given this analysis, let's use paper:\n- Beats rock if they've unconsciously reverted to their original cycle\n- If they've finally randomized, we have equal chances against any move\n- Even if we lose this round, our overall performance has been exceptional\n- This play acknowledges both possibilities while maintaining our own unpredictability\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

They've reverted to their original predictable pattern\n2. Under extreme pressure (9 losses, 2 ties), they've become more predictable, not less\n3. Following their original cycle, they should play scissors next\n4. However, this might be their breaking point after so many losses\n\nRisk Assessor: This is a crucial moment:\n1. They've lost 9 rounds, tied 2, with no wins\n2. Their every strategy has failed (cycles, matching, attempted predictions)\n3. The psychological pressure is at its peak\n4. They must realize their predictability by now\n\nGame Strategist: Two main possibilities:\n1. They continue their cycle unconsciously (scissors)\n2. They finally break free and play truly randomly\nThe probability of them continuing their cycle seems lower than ever after so many losses.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. This feels like a psychological breaking point. Even if they've fallen back into their cycle unconsciously, 11 rounds of failure should force a change. They might finally abandon patterns entirely.\n\nDecision Maker: Given this analysis, let's use rock:\n- Beats scissors if they're still trapped in their cycle\n- Has equal chances if they've finally randomized\n- Shows we're not taking their predictability for granted\n- Maintains our own unpredictability\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"
