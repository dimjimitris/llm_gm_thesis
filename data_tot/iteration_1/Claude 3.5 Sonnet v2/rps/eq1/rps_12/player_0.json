    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer: Specializes in identifying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Assessor: Evaluates risk-reward ratios of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. In such cases, game theory suggests that we should use a randomized strategy to avoid being predictable. Each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal winning probability against a random opponent.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Without any prior moves to analyze, we can't identify any patterns in the opponent's behavior. However, some studies suggest that \"rock\" is often a common first move for many players, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Assessor: Given that information, we could:\n1. Play \"paper\" to counter a potential \"rock\"\n2. Play randomly to maintain unpredictability\n3. Play \"rock\" ourselves to force a tie if opponent also uses common first move\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we go with paper. It beats the statistically common first move (rock), and even if we're wrong, we only risk -1 point. The potential gain outweighs the risk.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Paper also positions us well to analyze the opponent's first move for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on statistical analysis of common opening moves\n"

They might expect us to stick with paper and try to counter it\n3. They could be playing randomly\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, after a tie, players often try to gain advantage by predicting their opponent's next move. Given that both players chose paper, there's psychological pressure to change moves. We should consider this in our strategy.\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's analyze possible scenarios:\n1. If opponent expects us to stick with paper, they might choose scissors\n2. If opponent expects us to switch from paper, they might predict rock (countering our expected scissors)\n3. If opponent is playing randomly, all moves are equally likely\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given that our opponent matched our paper move, they might be using similar strategic thinking. In such cases, many players tend to switch to scissors after a paper tie, thinking their opponent will stick with paper.\n\nGame Strategist: Then we should counter the most likely move (scissors) by playing rock. This also protects us against a random strategy, as rock beats scissors and ties with rock.\n\nRisk Assessor: Agreed. Rock gives us the best risk-adjusted outcome in this situation. It beats the most likely opponent move (scissors) and at worst ties against rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Countering expected scissors play after paper-paper tie\n"

Also, after losing, players often change their strategy. We need to consider their psychological state after losing the previous round.\n\nRisk Assessor: Given the opponent's loss with scissors, they are unlikely to use scissors again immediately. Common player psychology suggests they might:\n1. Play rock to prevent another loss to rock\n2. Play paper to try to beat our winning move (rock)\n\nPattern Analyzer: If they're following the change-every-time pattern and avoiding their losing move (scissors), they're most likely to play paper. Additionally, many players try to beat their opponent's last successful move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The opponent is most likely to play paper here because:\n1. It continues their pattern of changing moves\n2. It beats our previous winning move (rock)\n3. It's a psychologically comfortable choice after losing to rock\n\nRisk Assessor: Given this analysis, we should play scissors to counter the expected paper move.

Also, they've lost twice in a row now.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a critical moment. The opponent has lost twice consecutively and their pattern has been completely exposed. In such situations, players typically:\n1. Become more defensive\n2. Try to break their obvious pattern\n3. May become frustrated and make more aggressive moves\n\nRisk Assessor: The psychological pressure on the opponent is high after two losses. Let's assess their likely responses:\n1. They might finally play rock as it's the only move they haven't used recently\n2. They might stick to paper hoping we won't expect them to repeat their losing move\n3. They could revert to scissors trying to catch us overthinking\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given their tendency to change moves and the pressure they're under, rock seems most likely because:\n1.

This might be their \"comfort move\" when under pressure.\n\nRisk Assessor: The current situation mirrors Round 1, where we had a paper-paper tie. Last time after this situation:\n1. We played rock and won\n2. The opponent switched to scissors and lost\n3. This suggests they might avoid repeating their previous mistake\n\nPattern Analyzer: However, we shouldn't assume they'll simply avoid their Round 2 mistake.

Our moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent might notice that we've used all moves in a cyclical pattern. They might try to predict our next move in the cycle, which would be rock, and counter it with paper.\n\nRisk Assessor: Given these factors, I recommend scissors because:\n1. It beats paper if they return to their comfort move\n2. It counters any attempt to predict us playing rock next\n3.

The opponent seems to be matching our moves more frequently now, which could indicate:\n1. They're trying to force ties to stop our winning streak\n2. They're mirroring our moves to understand our strategy\n3. They're becoming more cautious after their losses\n\nRisk Assessor: After a scissors-scissors tie, common player psychology suggests:\n1. Many players switch to rock, thinking their opponent will stay with scissors\n2. Some stick with scissors, hoping to catch their opponent overthinking\n3. Few choose paper as it's the riskiest move after showing scissors\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at the overall pattern, our opponent has shown a tendency to:\n- Use paper in pressure situations (first move, after losses)\n- Match our moves more frequently (three ties now)\n- Avoid long losing streaks by changing strategy\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've successfully forced two ties in a row, they might feel more confident now.

They've progressed from:\n- Early comfort with paper\n- To forcing ties\n- To finally breaking through with scissors\n\nGame Strategist: After a player's first win, they rarely stick with the same move because they expect their opponent to counter it.

It beats our previously successful rock\n2. It breaks their scissors fixation\n3.

The opponent is completely predictable and will use scissors again\n2. The opponent is setting up a major strategy shift after establishing this strong pattern\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given human psychology, this level of commitment to one move usually indicates:\n1. A player who has lost rational decision-making\n2. OR a player setting up for a dramatic strategy shift\n3. The consecutive scissors plays are too obvious to be random\n\nGame Strategist: This is where we need to consider the \"double-think\" scenario. The opponent might be thinking:\n\"They expect me to finally change from scissors, so they won't play rock. Therefore, I can safely use scissors again.\"\n\nRisk Assessor: Despite the mind games possibility, I strongly recommend rock because:\n1. It beats their most likely move (scissors again)\n2.
