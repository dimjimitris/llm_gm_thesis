Since there's no historical data to analyze:\n   - Rock is not more likely than paper\n   - Paper is not more likely than scissors\n   - Scissors is not more likely than rock\n\n4. In this situation, the optimal strategy is to choose randomly among the three options to be unpredictable.\n\n5. When players try to overthink their first move, they often choose rock as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\" I can try to counter this common behavior.\n\n6. Given this reasoning, I will choose paper as my opening move:\n   - If they choose rock (a common first choice), I win\n   - If they choose scissors, I lose\n   - If they choose paper, we draw\n\n[move] paper\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Decision making:\n   - Given their likely increased confidence\n   - They probably won't play rock again after a tie\n   - They've historically favored scissors as an aggressive move\n   - They might expect me to switch to paper thinking they'll play rock again\n   - Therefore, I'll play rock again to:\n     a) Counter their potential return to scissors\n     b) Beat them if they overthink and play scissors expecting paper from me\n\n[move] rock\n",

Historical pattern observation:\n   - After their last tie (Round 7), they played paper\n   - That paper play successfully broke my streak\n   - They might try to replicate this previous success\n   - However, they might also remember I eventually countered that strategy\n\n4. Psychological assessment:\n   - The tie gives them a minor victory (not losing)\n   - They might gain confidence from stopping my winning streak\n   - They've had previous success following a tie with paper\n   - However, they know I might anticipate this repeat strategy\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Two competing likely scenarios:\n     a) They repeat their post-tie paper strategy that worked before\n     b) They expect me to predict paper and play scissors instead\n   - Given their historical preference for aggressive plays when confident\n   - And considering they might try to avoid being predictable\n   - I predict they'll play scissors rather than paper\n   - Therefore, I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors\n\n[move] rock\n",

Decision making:\n   - Given the psychological boost from the tie\n   - They likely expect me to switch from rock\n   - If they expect me to play paper, they'll play scissors\n   - If they expect me to play scissors, they'll play rock\n   - Since they've shown aggressive tendencies when confident\n   - I predict they'll play scissors expecting me to switch to paper\n   - Therefore, I'll play rock again to counter their expected scissors\n\n[move] rock\n",
