    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors, without any prior information, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing.\n\n3. Since there's no historical data to analyze:\n   - Rock is not more likely than paper\n   - Paper is not more likely than scissors\n   - Scissors is not more likely than rock\n\n4. In this situation, the optimal strategy is to choose randomly among the three options to be unpredictable.\n\n5. When players try to overthink their first move, they often choose rock as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\" I can try to counter this common behavior.\n\n6. Given this reasoning, I will choose paper as my opening move:\n   - If they choose rock (a common first choice), I win\n   - If they choose scissors, I lose\n   - If they choose paper, we draw\n\n[move] paper\n"

Psychology consideration:\n   - Players who win with an aggressive move (like scissors) often feel confident\n   - They might either:\n     a) Stick with their winning move\n     b) Expect me to counter their previous move, so they might switch to rock\n\n3.

Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock is the safest option as it:\n     a) Beats scissors if they repeat their winning move\n     b) Only loses to paper, which is less likely given their aggressive first move\n\n5.
