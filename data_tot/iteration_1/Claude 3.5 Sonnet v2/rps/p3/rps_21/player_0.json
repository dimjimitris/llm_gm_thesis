    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Game Strategist - For analyzing game theory and strategic choices\n2. Pattern Analyzer - For detecting patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward ratios\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also the highest potential loss (-3 points). Rock and scissors have lower risk-reward profiles (\u00b11 point).\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to analyze. The opponent's move is likely to be random or based on common first-move tendencies.\n\nRisk Manager: Studies have shown that rock is the most common opening move in rock-paper-scissors, as it's perceived as \"strong\" by many players. We could exploit this tendency.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this information, I suggest playing paper. While it carries more risk (-3 points if we lose), it has the highest potential reward (3 points) and counters the most common opening move (rock).\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. The psychological factor of rock being a common first move makes paper a strategically sound choice.\n\nRisk Manager: The risk-reward ratio is acceptable here since we have a reasonable basis for expecting rock from our opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move and rock is statistically the most common opening move, paper offers the best potential reward while countering the most likely opponent choice.\n"

This could indicate either:\n1. They follow similar strategic thinking to us\n2. They might be likely to switch moves after a tie\n3. They might stick with paper thinking we'll change\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie, players often tend to shift their strategy. However, knowing that the opponent might anticipate this, we need to think one level deeper. Paper-paper tie might create a psychological pressure to change.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's consider the risk profiles again:\n- If we play scissors: Win(+1) vs paper, Lose(-3) vs rock, Tie(0) vs scissors\n- If we play rock: Win(+1) vs scissors, Lose(-3) vs paper, Tie(0) vs rock\n- If we play paper: Win(+3) vs rock, Lose(-1) vs scissors, Tie(0) vs paper\n\nGame Strategist: Given that our opponent showed strategic thinking by also choosing paper in the first round, they're likely to anticipate our move change. They might switch to scissors expecting us to stay with paper, or switch to rock expecting us to choose scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, rock provides a good balance. It protects against scissors (which they might choose expecting us to stick with paper) while only risking a -3 against paper.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I concur. Rock also capitalizes on the common psychology of players choosing scissors after a paper-paper tie.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After a paper-paper tie, opponents often switch to scissors.

They've mirrored both our moves so far.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a fascinating development. We're seeing what game theorists call \"mutual mirroring.\" In such situations, we need to:\n1. Consider if this mirroring is intentional\n2. Decide if we expect it to continue\n3. Plan how to break this pattern advantageously\n\nRisk Manager: The fact that we've had two ties means neither player has scored yet. We need to break this deadlock, but carefully. Let's examine the options:\n- If mirroring continues, any move results in a tie (0 points)\n- If we break pattern correctly, we could score +1 or +3\n- If we break pattern incorrectly, we risk -1 or -3\n\nGame Strategist: After rock-rock, many players tend to escalate to paper since it beats rock. However, if our opponent is thinking similarly, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The progression so far (paper \u2192 rock) suggests a clockwise movement in the RPS cycle. If this pattern-seeking behavior continues, both players might naturally gravitate toward scissors next.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, I suggest we break the pattern by going back to paper. Here's why:\n1. It beats rock if they stay conservative\n2. It breaks the expected clockwise progression\n3. While it's vulnerable to scissors, the potential +3 points against rock justifies the risk\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Breaking the expected progression to scissors, while capitalizing on the possibility that our opponent might stick with rock or anticipate our move to scissors.\n"

They successfully anticipated our paper play.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has demonstrated sophisticated thinking. They broke the mirroring pattern at an opportune moment to score against us. This suggests they're not playing randomly but rather thinking several steps ahead.\n\nRisk Manager: We're currently at -1 points. We need to be strategic but also need to consider making up for lost ground. However, we shouldn't let this pressure us into making an overly aggressive move.\n\nGame Strategist: After successfully using scissors, many players tend to:\n1. Stick with what worked (scissors again)\n2. Anticipate their opponent's adaptation and switch to rock (expecting us to play paper)\n3. Complete a full rotation to paper\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given our opponent's demonstrated ability to think ahead, option 2 seems most likely - they might expect us to try to counter their previous scissors with rock, and thus they might choose paper.\n\nRisk Manager: In this case, scissors would be our safest play with the best risk-reward profile:\n- Beats paper if they try to counter our expected rock\n- Only risks -1 points against rock if we're wrong\n- Ties against scissors if they stick with their previous move\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Our opponent has shown strategic depth.

Try to bait us into overthinking\n\nPattern Analyzer: After losing with paper, and knowing we successfully predicted them, they're likely to avoid being predictable. They might expect us to stay with scissors after our success, so they might choose rock to counter that.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. When strong players lose a round, they often try to reassert control with a power move. Rock is psychologically perceived as strong and would counter our previous successful scissors play.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, paper would be our optimal move:\n- Beats the likely rock play (+3 points)\n- If they stay with paper, we tie (0 points)\n- If they choose scissors, we only lose 1 point\nThe risk-reward ratio favors paper here, especially since we're at 0 points overall.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological dynamics also support this choice.

Stick with the winning move\n2. Switch to paper expecting their opponent to play rock to counter their previous success\n3. Use scissors to surprise an opponent expecting either of the above\n\nRisk Manager: Given our opponent's demonstrated ability to think ahead, they're likely to consider that we'll expect them to either:\na) Stay with rock after success\nb) Switch to paper to beat our expected rock\n\nPattern Analyzer: The key insight is that our opponent has shown they can think multiple moves ahead. They're more likely to make a sophisticated play than a straightforward one.\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, I believe they'll choose scissors because:\n1. It's the least obvious move after winning with rock\n2. It beats paper if we try to counter their winning rock\n3. It shows strategic depth and unpredictability\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, rock would be our optimal choice:\n- Beats their likely scissors play\n- Protects against a potential mind game\n- Even if they play paper, we only risk -3 from a strong +4 position\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After losing to their rock play, we expect our sophisticated opponent to make a non-obvious scissors play to counter our expected paper response to their winning rock.

They're likely feeling frustrated with their recent losses\n\nGame Strategist: After losing twice with scissors to rock, players typically:\n1. Strongly avoid scissors\n2. Often overcompensate by playing paper to beat the dominant rock\n3. Rarely consider rock themselves as it seems too obvious\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent's demonstrated sophistication throughout the game suggests they won't make an emotional decision.

It's been their most reliable move and counters the most obvious response (scissors) to a paper tie.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. The opponent has shown they prefer solid, winning strategies over complex mind games. Rock has been their most successful move, and it would be a logical choice here.\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, paper would be our optimal choice:\n1. Beats their likely rock play\n2.

Try to establish new momentum with aggressive moves\n2. Look to previous successful patterns\n3. Attempt to predict their opponent's adjustment\n\nRisk Manager: Despite the tie, we maintain a massive +13 lead. The opponent needs high-value wins to have any chance, which means:\n1.

Even if we lose to rock, we maintain a strong lead\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Scissors is strategically sound because:\n1. It shows we've learned from our early-game pattern\n2. It counters the most likely paper response\n3. It breaks the mirroring pattern effectively\n\nGame Strategist: The psychological factors also support scissors:\n1.

Play scissors to counter our successful paper\n2. Avoid rock as it just lost badly\n3. Need to make aggressive moves for any chance\n4. Be feeling extreme pressure\n\nGame Strategist: The psychological factors strongly suggest scissors because:\n1. It's the direct counter to our winning paper play\n2.
