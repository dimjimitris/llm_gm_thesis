Psychological breaking point:\n   - They've now:\n     * Used paper four consecutive times\n     * Been punished twice for it\n     * Seen all possible outcomes\n     * Must feel extremely predictable\n   - Pattern is clearly not working\n\n3. Historical comparison:\n   - Earlier in game they showed:\n     * Similar fixation with scissors\n     * Eventually broke pattern after losses\n     * Made significant strategy changes\n     * Capable of adaptation\n\n4. Pattern breaking likelihood:\n   - Four consecutive same moves is extreme\n   - Pressure to change is now very high\n   - They've been punished multiple times\n   - Change is almost certain\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - After four papers and two recent losses:\n     * They almost must switch strategy\n     * Likely to avoid paper completely\n     * Might try rock as defensive move\n     * Could try scissors as complete reversal\n\n[move] rock I choose rock because after four consecutive paper plays and multiple punishments, they're highly likely to switch to scissors as a complete pattern break and to counter expected paper or scissors from me.\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
