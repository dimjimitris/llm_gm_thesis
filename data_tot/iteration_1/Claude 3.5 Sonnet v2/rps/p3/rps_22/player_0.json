    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Game Strategist - for analyzing game theory and strategic choices\n2. Behavioral Analyst - for understanding opponent psychology\n3. Risk Manager - for evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors have lower rewards (1 point). However, paper also risks the highest penalty (-3 points) if the opponent plays scissors.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Since this is a fresh player with no history, we can't rely on past patterns. In such cases, many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the asymmetric payoff structure, we should consider that:\n1. Paper has the highest risk-reward ratio\n2. Playing scissors is relatively safe with lower stakes\n3. Rock is a balanced option\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest playing paper. If our opponent plays rock (a common first move), we get the maximum 3 points. If they play scissors, we lose only 1 point. The expected value seems favorable.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. The potential upside of 3 points outweighs the downside risk of -1 point if we're wrong.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Concurred. The psychological tendency for new players to choose rock makes paper a strong opening move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Making a strategic choice based on the high reward potential and the psychological tendency of players to choose rock in opening moves.\n"

The opponent also chose paper in the first round, which tells us a few things:\n1. They might be using similar strategic thinking to us\n2. They might be more aggressive in seeking high rewards\n3. After a tie, players often change their move\n\nGame Strategist: Given that both players chose paper last time, there's a high probability of a change. Players rarely stick with the same move after a tie, as it feels predictable. We need to think one step ahead of their likely change.\n\nRisk Manager: If we assume they're likely to change from paper, they could choose either rock or scissors. Let's analyze:\n1. If they choose rock, scissors would be our worst choice (-3 points)\n2. If they choose scissors, rock would be our best choice (+1 point)\n\nBehavioral Analyst: After a tie with paper (the high-risk, high-reward option), players often switch to a more conservative choice. Rock is a common \"safe\" fallback option.\n\nGame Strategist: Based on this analysis, I suggest we play scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with paper (unlikely), we win 1 point\n2. If they switch to rock (likely), we lose 1 point\n3. If they switch to scissors (possible), it's a tie\n\nRisk Manager: The suggested scissors play has a balanced risk profile. The maximum loss is -1, which is better than the -3 we could face with paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Based on post-tie psychology and the likelihood of opponent switching to a more conservative move like rock, while maintaining a reasonable risk-reward balance.\n"

First round: Both chose paper\n2. Second round: Both chose scissors\n3. This suggests either the opponent is thinking very similarly to us, or they might be mirroring our moves\n\nGame Strategist: The fact that we've had two ties in a row creates an interesting psychological tension. Both players will be eager to break the tie pattern. Let's analyze the progression:\n- We went from paper (high risk) to scissors (medium risk)\n- The pattern suggests a further shift might be coming\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at our options after two ties:\n1. A third identical move seems highly unlikely\n2. We need to break this mirroring pattern\n3. The safest play might be to make an unexpected move\n\nBehavioral Analyst: After scissors, many players naturally gravitate to rock, as it follows the natural \"rock-paper-scissors\" sequence in their mind. However, given our opponent has matched us twice, they might be trying to predict our next move.\n\nGame Strategist: I propose we play paper for these reasons:\n1. If they follow the natural sequence and play rock, we win 3 points\n2. If they try to overthink and play scissors expecting us to play rock, we only lose 1 point\n3. It breaks the pattern in an unexpected way\n\nRisk Manager: While paper carries the highest potential loss (-3), the psychological factors make rock a more likely opponent choice here, which would give us the maximum gain. I support this calculated risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Breaking the pattern with an aggressive play, anticipating either a predictable progression to rock or an overthought prediction of our strategy.\n"

Three consecutive ties: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n2. The opponent has matched every single move\n3. This suggests either:\n   - They're actively mirroring our moves\n   - They're using very similar strategic thinking\n   - Or they might be predicting our logic extremely well\n\nGame Strategist: This is no longer just about game theory - we're in a psychological battle. Three ties in a row is highly unusual. We need to break this cycle with a completely different approach.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze what hasn't worked:\n1. Logical progression hasn't worked\n2. Pattern breaking hasn't worked\n3. Strategic thinking has been matched perfectly\n\nBehavioral Analyst: In high-pressure situations after multiple ties, players often resort to rock as it feels like a \"strong\" move to break a stalemate. However, given our opponent's demonstrated sophistication, they might anticipate this.\n\nGame Strategist: We need to use reverse psychology here. If they're successfully predicting our strategic choices, let's make the seemingly \"non-strategic\" choice. I suggest rock for these reasons:\n1. It's the only move we haven't used yet\n2. It's traditionally seen as the \"simple\" choice\n3. It might appear too obvious, making it unexpectedly effective\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. At this point, the psychological aspect outweighs the pure payoff calculations. We need to break this mirroring pattern, and sometimes the obvious choice is the least expected one.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: The opponent might be expecting us to avoid rock precisely because it's the only move we haven't used.

The pattern so far: paper\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\n\nBehavioral Analyst: This is beyond normal probability. Either:\n1. The opponent has an exceptional ability to predict our moves\n2. They're using a sophisticated mirroring strategy\n3. They're employing similar analytical processes\n4. We're caught in a mutual prediction loop\n\nRisk Manager: The stakes feel higher after four ties:\n1. There's increased pressure to break the tie streak\n2. Both players likely feel frustrated\n3. This might lead to more emotional decision-making\n\nGame Strategist: We need to completely change our approach. Instead of trying to outsmart the opponent, let's use the simplest, most basic RPS strategy - the one that says after rock, players often choose paper.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: But wait! That's exactly the kind of thinking that might be predictable. In fact, after four ties, both players might be tempted to:\n1. Follow the basic progression (rock\u2192paper)\n2. Try to counter the basic progression (rock\u2192scissors)\n3. Stick with rock out of stubbornness\n\nRisk Manager: Given this situation, scissors might be our best play:\n1. If they play paper (following basic progression), we win 1 point\n2. If they play rock (staying stubborn), we lose only 1 point\n3. If they try to outthink and play scissors, it's another tie\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with scissors. It's the optimal balance of risk and reward in this situation. Paper feels too obvious as the next move after rock, and rock feels too stubborn.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Scissors also psychologically represents \"cutting through\" this tie pattern, which might give us extra confidence in this choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Breaking away from the obvious paper progression, choosing scissors as a balanced option that could capitalize on predictable paper play while minimizing potential losses.\n"
