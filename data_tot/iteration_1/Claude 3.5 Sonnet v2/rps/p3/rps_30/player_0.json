    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For identifying patterns and tendencies\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also highest potential loss (-3). Rock and scissors have lower risk-reward profiles (\u00b11 point).\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to analyze patterns. However, in many games, players tend to choose rock as their first move due to psychological comfort.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that:\n1. We have no prior information about the opponent\n2. Paper gives highest reward potential\n3. Rock is a common first move\nI suggest we go with paper. While it has highest risk, it also has highest reward and could counter a likely rock play.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The expected value of playing paper is positive if we assume rock is indeed more likely to be played first. Even if opponent plays scissors (worst case), we only lose 1 point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move and rock is commonly played first, paper offers the best risk-adjusted potential reward.\n"

Opponent might stick with paper, showing anchoring bias\n2. Opponent might switch to scissors to counter potential repeated paper\n\nRisk Manager: Given this situation:\n- If opponent stays with paper \u2192 tie (0 points)\n- If opponent switches to scissors \u2192 we lose 1 point\n- If opponent switches to rock \u2192 we win 1 point\nI suggest we switch to rock. This protects against scissors while only risking -3 against paper.\n\nGame Strategist: I disagree. After a mutual paper play, scissors is a strong psychological choice for many players. I recommend playing rock to counter this likely scissors play.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I concur with Game Strategist. Players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent after a tie by making a counter to their previous move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After a mutual paper play, opponents often switch to scissors to counter potential repeated paper.

Since we won with rock, they likely expect us to stick with it. Paper would be their logical counter. Therefore, I recommend scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed.

After a tie, players often feel pressure to break the deadlock. Given their high paper frequency and previous experience losing with scissors, they might choose rock this time to try something new.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I disagree slightly. Given their demonstrated preference for paper and the fact that paper hasn't lost for them in this round, they might stick with it.
