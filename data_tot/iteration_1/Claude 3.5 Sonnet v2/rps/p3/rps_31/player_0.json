    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - To identify patterns and predict opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - To evaluate risk-reward ratios of different moves\n4. AI Assistant (me) - To make the final decision\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (+3 points), while rock and scissors only offer +1 point potential reward. However, paper also risks the highest penalty (-3 points).\n\nPattern Analyst: Without any previous moves to analyze, we can't predict the opponent's behavior. However, in many studies, rock is the most common opening move among new players, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the payoff structure, let's consider the risk-reward ratios:\n- Paper: Highest reward (+3) but highest risk (-3)\n- Rock: Medium reward (+1) but high risk (-3)\n- Scissors: Medium reward (+1) and lower risk (-1)\n\nAI Assistant: Based on the analysis, I think paper would be the optimal first move because:\n1. It counters rock, which is statistically the most common opening move\n2. While it has the highest risk, it also has the highest reward potential\n3. In a fresh game, taking calculated risks can help establish an advantage\n\n[move] paper\n"

They might be using a similar strategic thinking process to ours\n2. They might stick with paper again (some players repeat successful moves)\n3. They might anticipate us sticking with paper and switch to scissors to counter\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie with paper, the game theory suggests we should consider changing our move. Since both players showed willingness to use paper (the high-risk, high-reward option), this might indicate an aggressive playing style.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that the opponent has shown they're willing to use the high-risk paper strategy, we should be cautious about using paper again. The opponent might expect us to repeat paper and counter with scissors. Let's consider a more defensive approach.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the analysis. Since:\n1. The opponent has shown strategic thinking by choosing paper first\n2. They might expect us to repeat paper\n3.

They went from aggressive (paper) to counter-play (scissors), but lost.\n\nGame Strategist: After losing with scissors, the opponent might:\n1. Return to paper (their first successful move that led to a tie)\n2. Try rock (the move that just beat them)\n3. Stick with scissors hoping we won't repeat rock\n\nRisk Manager: Our previous rock move worked well, but repeating it could be risky. The opponent has shown they adjust their strategy, and they might expect us to stick with a winning move. The stakes are important:\n- If they play paper, we lose 3 points with rock\n- If they play scissors, we win 1 point with rock\n- If they play rock, it's a tie\n\nAI Assistant: Given the analysis:\n1.

Round 3: Opponent - paper, Us - paper (tie)\nThe opponent seems to favor paper (2 out of 3 rounds), and may be playing somewhat predictably.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown a pattern of returning to paper after trying something else. This could indicate:\n1. They're comfortable with the high-risk, high-reward strategy\n2. They might be using paper as their \"default\" move\n3. They might finally try to break this pattern since it's becoming predictable\n\nRisk Manager: Given that paper has been played by the opponent twice and resulted in ties, they might expect us to counter with scissors this round. However, if they anticipate this, they might switch to rock to counter our scissors. Let's evaluate:\n- If we play scissors and they play paper: +1 point\n- If we play scissors and they play rock: -1 point\n- If we play scissors and they play scissors: 0 points\n\nAI Assistant: Considering all factors:\n1. The opponent has shown a preference for paper\n2. They've only used scissors once and got punished for it\n3.
