    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern analysis:\n   - Following their clockwise rotation pattern, they might play paper next\n   - However, they've lost twice now and might break their pattern\n   - They might realize I've won twice and try to predict my next move\n\n3. Psychological considerations:\n   - After two losses, they're likely to change their strategy\n   - They might expect me to be overconfident\n   - They might try to predict that I'll play rock again after its success\n\n4.

Pattern evaluation:\n   - Their brief paper strategy has completely dissolved\n   - They've reverted to their original scissors comfort zone\n   - Rock has consistently beaten their scissors throughout the game\n   - They show difficulty maintaining strategic adaptations\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   - After failing with paper strategy, they've regressed to familiar scissors\n   - They seem to prefer familiar losses over strategic adaptation\n   - They might be thinking:\n     * \"Rock has beaten me many times before\"\n     * \"They must expect me to change after losing\"\n     * \"Paper would be the obvious counter to rock\"\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they finally adapt and play paper: rock loses (-3)\n   - If they stick with scissors: rock wins (+1)\n   - If they play rock: rock ties (0)\n   - Their history suggests they resist changing even when logical\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   - Given their strong historical preference for scissors\n   - Given their pattern of returning to scissors after failed adaptations\n   - Given their demonstrated resistance to change even after losses\n   - Given their psychological attachment to scissors\n   - Rock remains the optimal choice despite its obviousness\n\n[move] rock\n"
