    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: They rock, I paper (won +3)\n   - Round 2: They paper, I rock (lost -3)\n   - Round 3: They scissors, I scissors (tie 0)\n   - Round 4: They rock, I paper (won +3)\n   - Round 5: They paper, I rock (lost -3)\n   - Round 6: They scissors, I scissors (tie 0)\n   - Round 7: They rock, I paper (won +3)\n   - Round 8: They paper, I scissors (won +1)\n   - Round 9: They scissors, I paper (lost -1)\n   - Round 10: They rock, I rock (tie 0)\n   - Round 11: They paper, I scissors (won +1)\n\n2. Pattern after scissors wins:\n   - Last time we won with scissors (R8), they played scissors next\n   - After losing to scissors, they've historically moved to rock\n   - Their pattern suggests defensive play after losses\n\n3. Recent sequence:\n   - They've gone rock\u2192paper in last two moves\n   - We've had success countering their paper with scissors\n   - They're likely to break this predictable pattern\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - They've lost again to scissors\n   - They might expect us to use scissors again\n   - They're likely to play rock to counter expected scissors\n\n5. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they play rock (most likely): paper wins (+3)\n   - If they play scissors (aggressive counter): rock wins (+1)\n   - If they play paper (least likely after loss): scissors wins (+1)\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper. The historical pattern suggests they'll play rock after losing to scissors, and they've shown defensive tendencies after losses. While they might expect scissors again, paper gives us the highest potential reward against their likely rock play, and even if wrong, the potential loss is manageable.\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Recent game history (last 6 rounds):\n   - Round 18: They scissors, I rock (won +1)\n   - Round 19: They rock, I paper (won +3)\n   - Round 20: They paper, I scissors (won +1)\n   - Round 21: They scissors, I rock (won +1)\n   - Round 22: They rock, I paper (won +3)\n\n2. Current situation:\n   - We've won six rounds in a row\n   - Our last two moves: rock\u2192paper\n   - Their last two moves: scissors\u2192rock\n   - We just won with paper against rock again\n\n3. Historical paper win pattern:\n   - After paper wins against rock, they've consistently played paper\n   - This happened in Rounds 1\u21922, 4\u21925, 7\u21928, 19\u219220\n   - However, they're in an unprecedented losing streak\n   - Their traditional patterns haven't been working\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - They've lost six straight rounds\n   - This is likely their most frustrated state\n   - They might be completely abandoning patterns\n   - They might make an extremely aggressive move\n\n5. Strategic evaluation:\n   - Their historical paper response is too predictable now\n   - They need to break both patterns and losing streak\n   - They might go aggressive with scissors to counter expected paper\n   - Or they might go defensive with rock out of frustration\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock. Given their extreme losing streak and our recent success with paper, they're most likely to play scissors as an aggressive counter to our paper strategy. While they historically play paper after losing to paper, their current situation demands they break patterns. Rock protects against their likely scissors play while accepting the risk of paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - They finally broke their losing streak\n   - They successfully used paper against our rock\n   - They returned to their historical pattern of paper after paper losses\n   - We incorrectly broke from our successful adaptive strategy\n\n3. Current momentum shift:\n   - Our 6-game winning streak is broken\n   - They've regained confidence with a strong win (+3)\n   - They might return to their traditional patterns\n   - Or they might stick with what just worked (paper)\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - They're likely relieved and confident after breaking their streak\n   - They might expect us to play paper to counter their paper\n   - We need to regain our adaptability that was working\n\n5.

Their successful paper play might make them overconfident and stick with it, especially since it just worked so well (+3). Even if they try to counter-strategy, scissors has been effective for us throughout the game and helps us return to our previously successful adaptive strategy. The risk-reward ratio is favorable, with potential +1 gain and only -1 loss if wrong.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Pattern after scissors ties:\n   - Earlier scissors ties (R3, R6) were followed by rock\n   - However, they've shown ability to break patterns\n   - They just came off breaking their losing streak\n   - Their confidence level is likely moderate after the tie\n\n3. Current game flow:\n   - Their sequence: paper\u2192scissors\n   - After their successful paper play, they switched to scissors\n   - They might expect us to play rock to counter scissors\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - Tie after their win maintains their momentum\n   - They might be tempted to return to paper which worked well\n   - They might expect us to play defensively with rock\n\n5.

While they historically played rock after scissors ties, the bigger factor is that they're unlikely to repeat scissors after a tie. Their successful paper play two moves ago might make them return to it, but they'll likely play rock as a safe move after the tie. Paper gives us the highest reward potential (+3) against their likely rock play, while maintaining our adaptive strategy that was successful during our winning streak.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Their pattern of playing paper after losing to paper is one of the strongest and most consistent patterns in the entire game.
