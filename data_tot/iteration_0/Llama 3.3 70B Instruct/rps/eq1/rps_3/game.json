Since we are playing against a fresh player, we don't have any information about their previous moves. In this case, a good starting point is to choose a move that has a high probability of winning. \n\nPsychologist: I agree with the Strategist. Since we don't have any information about the opponent, we should focus on making a move that is less likely to be predicted. \n\nStatistician: From a statistical perspective, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of being chosen.

In this case, choosing rock could be a good initial move, as it is often the most intuitive choice for new players.\n\nStrategist: Considering the Analyst's and Psychologist's insights, I suggest we make our initial move as rock.
