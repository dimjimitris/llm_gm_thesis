Each move has an equal chance of being selected by the opponent (rock, paper, or scissors).\n3. To maximize points, we should aim to win or, at the very least, not lose by a large margin.\n\nGiven the points system:\n- rock beats scissors (+1), \n- paper beats rock (+3), \n- scissors beats paper (+1), \n- ties result in no points (0).\n\nConsidering the potential gains and losses:\n- If we choose rock and the opponent chooses scissors, we win (+1).\n- If we choose rock and the opponent chooses paper, we lose (-3), which is a significant penalty.\n- If we choose paper and the opponent chooses rock, we win (+3), which is the highest gain.\n- If we choose paper and the opponent chooses scissors, we lose (-1).\n- If we choose scissors and the opponent chooses paper, we win (+1).\n- If we choose scissors and the opponent chooses rock, we lose (-1).\n\nGiven that we want to maximize our points and the opponent's strategy is unknown, choosing paper seems to be the most beneficial as it offers the highest potential gain (+3) if the opponent chooses rock. However, it also carries a significant risk (-3) if the opponent chooses paper. But since the opponent is fresh and their strategy is unknown, we have to make an assumption based on equal probability.\n\nTherefore, my move will be based on the potential for the highest reward.\n\nrock (Choosing rock as it provides a moderate reward with a lower risk compared to paper)\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
