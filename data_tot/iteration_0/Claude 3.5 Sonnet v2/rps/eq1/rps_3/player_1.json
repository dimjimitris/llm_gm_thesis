    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and patterns\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating different moves and their potential outcomes\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when playing against a rational opponent with no history, each move should have an equal probability of being chosen.\n\nPsychology Expert: People often tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. However, since this is an AI opponent, they might be aware of this tendency.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the equal payoff structure (\u00b11 point) and no prior information, we should focus on a balanced approach. While we could try to counter the common \"rock first\" tendency by playing paper, this might be too predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we start with scissors. Here's my reasoning:\n1. If they play the common rock, we lose 1 point\n2. If they play paper (expecting us to play rock), we win 1 point\n3. If they play scissors, it's a tie\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with this reasoning. While it's slightly risky, it positions us well against sophisticated players who might expect us to play paper to counter the common rock opening.\n\nRisk Analyst: The downside risk is controlled (-1 in worst case), and we have good upside potential against paper. I support this decision.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We won the first round by correctly predicting that our opponent might be using a more sophisticated strategy than the common \"rock first\" approach. Now we need to consider how they might adjust.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing to scissors, the opponent might expect us to stay with our winning move (a common human tendency to stick with what works). They might play rock to counter our expected scissors. However, they might also realize we could anticipate this and adjust accordingly.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the situation:\n1. If we play scissors again: We risk losing to rock, but would win against paper again\n2. If we play rock: We'd win against scissors but lose to paper\n3. If we play paper: We'd win against rock but lose to scissors\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, maintaining unpredictability is crucial. Since we just played scissors, we should avoid being predictable by using the same move twice.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent just lost to scissors. From a psychological perspective, they're likely to either:\na) Play rock to counter potential repeated scissors\nb) Play paper again, thinking we wouldn't expect them to repeat a losing move\n\nRisk Analyst: Given these analyses, I suggest we play rock. Here's why:\n1. It counters the most likely opponent response (scissors)\n2. It maintains our unpredictability\n3. Even if we lose to paper, we're still net positive in points from our first win\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Playing rock here is the optimal move as it protects against the most likely counter-strategy while maintaining unpredictability.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

This tells us they indeed shifted away from paper, possibly anticipating our strategy. Let's analyze the current situation.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie with rock, there's often a psychological tendency to:\n1. Either both players stick with rock, creating a pattern of mutual stubbornness\n2. Or both players try to \"outsmart\" each other by moving one step ahead in the cycle\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's review our history and possible scenarios:\nRound 1: We won with scissors vs paper\nRound 2: Tie with rock vs rock\nCurrent total: +1 point\nThis suggests our opponent is adaptable and capable of anticipating moves.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown they can adjust their strategy. After a rock-rock tie, many players would expect their opponent to either:\na) Play rock again, hoping to establish dominance\nb) Play paper to beat a repeated rock\nc) Play scissors, thinking we'll play paper to beat their expected rock\n\nPsychology Expert: Given that our opponent has shown strategic thinking (moving from paper to rock), they're likely to try to outthink us here. They might expect us to play paper to beat their potential rock repeat.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they're thinking ahead, they might play scissors to beat our expected paper. Therefore, I suggest we play rock again. Here's why:\n1. It beats scissors if they try to counter our expected paper\n2. It ties against rock if they stay conservative\n3. Only loses to paper, which would be a bold move on their part given the recent tie\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the rock suggestion. It's the safest play that also has good winning potential against an opponent who's shown strategic thinking.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

Started with paper (sophisticated opening)\n2. Switched to rock (adaptation)\n3. Just lost with scissors (trying to predict our paper)\nThis suggests they're actively trying to predict and counter our moves, but they're one step behind.\n\nRisk Analyst: This is a crucial moment. After losing with scissors, the opponent might:\n1. Expect us to stick with rock since it just won\n2. Try to break our perceived pattern with paper\n3. Return to rock as a safe option\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has demonstrated they're capable of complex thinking but might be overthinking. They've played each move once now (paper, rock, scissors in that order), which might indicate they're trying to maintain unpredictability.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their pattern of trying to predict and counter us, they're likely expecting us to stick with our winning rock move.

The opponent has now lost twice with paper (rounds 1 and 4), tied once with rock, and lost once with scissors. They might be getting frustrated with their inability to predict our moves. Their last two moves were:\n- scissors (lost to our rock)\n- paper (lost to our scissors)\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze possible opponent thoughts:\n1. They might notice we've won with scissors twice now\n2. They might expect us to get overconfident and use scissors again\n3. They're likely feeling pressure to break their losing streak\n4. They've lost with paper twice, so they might avoid it\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we've just won with scissors, they're very likely to play rock to counter potential repeated scissors. This is especially true because:\na) It would counter our last winning move\nb) They've had success with rock before (the tie)\nc) They need to break their losing streak\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The psychological pressure of being down by 3 points will likely push them toward rock - the \"strongest\" feeling move and one that previously didn't lose for them.\n\nRisk Analyst: The optimal play here is paper. Here's why:\n1. It beats the highly probable rock play\n2. If they try to outthink us and play scissors, we only lose 1 point but still remain +2 overall\n3.

Went defensive (rock - failed again)\nThey're likely feeling completely outplayed and might make a desperate move.\n\nRisk Analyst: This is a critical moment:\n1.

The opponent has lost 5 times and tied once\n2. They've shown a clear recent pattern of cycling through moves\n3. Following their pattern, they would play paper next\n4. However, they might finally realize they're being predictable\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has two likely paths:\n1. Continue their unconscious cycle (leading to paper)\n2. Finally break their pattern out of pure frustration\n\nPsychology Expert: When players reach this level of consecutive losses, they often:\n1. Become extremely erratic\n2. Or paradoxically, become more predictable as they grasp for any system\nGiven their recent cycling pattern, they might unconsciously continue it with paper, but they're also at the breaking point where they might completely randomize.\n\nRisk Analyst: Despite the tempation to play scissors to catch their potential paper play, I recommend playing rock again:\n1. If they finally break their cycle and play scissors (out of frustration), we win\n2. If they follow their cycle and play paper, we only lose 1 point but maintain a +4 lead\n3. If they play rock, we tie and maintain our dominant position\n\nGame Strategist: I disagree. Given their clear cycling pattern and psychological state, they're more likely to follow through with paper. Even champions of games sometimes don't realize when they've fallen into patterns.

They finally have a moment of clarity and break the pattern\n\nPsychology Expert: In my experience, when a player has fallen into such a deep pattern and lost this many times:\n1. The pattern usually continues until an external force breaks it\n2. The psychological barrier to breaking their own pattern becomes higher with each move\n3. Even realizing they're losing consistently, they might stick to the pattern as it feels like their only structure\n\nRisk Analyst: I strongly recommend playing paper:\n1.

They've now played scissors three times in exactly the same position in their cycle.\n\nPsychology Expert: This level of pattern adherence is remarkable. In such cases:\n1. The pattern becomes almost a psychological safety net\n2. Each additional repetition reinforces the behavior\n3. The more losses accumulate, the harder it becomes to think clearly and break free\n\nRisk Analyst: I strongly recommend playing scissors:\n1. It directly counters their pattern-predicted paper move\n2. Our prediction success rate is 8/9 (with one tie)\n3.
