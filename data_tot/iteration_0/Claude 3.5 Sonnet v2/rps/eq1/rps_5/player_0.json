    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors, all moves are equally viable as initial choices:\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Scissors beats paper\n\n3. Without any historical data, each move has a 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing.\n\n4. In this situation, a random but strategic choice is reasonable.\n\n5. Studies have shown that in RPS, rock is the most common opening move among players (roughly 35% of the time), likely because:\n   - Rock is perceived as \"strong\"\n   - It's often the first option people think of\n   - It's a comfortable gesture to make\n\n6. Given this psychological tendency, paper would be a good counter to a likely rock opening.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper to counter the statistical likelihood of a rock opening.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analysis of last round:\n   - Both players chose paper\n   - This reveals the opponent might think similarly to me strategically\n   - They may also be using game theory principles\n\n2. Common player behavior after a tie:\n   - Many players tend to change their move after a tie\n   - They often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent by predicting the next move\n\n3. Given we both played paper, the opponent might:\n   - Expect me to switch to something else\n   - Switch to scissors to beat my paper if I stick with it\n   - Or switch to rock thinking I'll choose scissors\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they expect me to switch from paper, they might choose scissors\n   - Rock would be a safe play against their potential scissors\n\n5. Psychological element:\n   - The opponent might overthink and try to be too clever\n   - Sometimes the unexpected move is to not change at all\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock as it protects against the likely scissors play while also being effective if they overthink and choose paper again.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Recent history analysis:\n   - Last 5 rounds show dominant pattern:\n     * Won with paper vs their rock\n     * Won with rock vs their scissors\n     * Won with paper vs their rock\n   - I'm on a remarkable 4-win streak\n   - They've played rock twice in last three moves\n\n2. Psychological assessment:\n   - They've lost 4 straight rounds\n   - Extreme frustration likely\n   - Their confidence is severely damaged\n   - Every counter-strategy has failed\n   - They're in a desperate position\n\n3. Pattern breakdown:\n   - Their recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - My moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They're stuck in a reactive pattern\n   - Each move has been countered successfully\n\n4. Under extreme pressure:\n   - Players often:\n     * Make aggressive moves out of desperation\n     * Abandon logical patterns completely\n     * Try anything to break a losing streak\n     * Or paradoxically become more predictable\n   - After losing with rock twice, scissors is their most likely aggressive counter\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - They know paper has beaten them twice recently\n   - Scissors is the obvious counter to paper\n   - They're likely to make this straightforward counter\n   - In their frustrated state, complex strategy is unlikely\n\nFinal decision: After losing to paper twice with rock, and being in a highly frustrated state, they're most likely to make the aggressive scissors play to finally counter paper. I'll choose rock to beat their expected scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current situation analysis:\n   - I'm on an incredible 5-win streak\n   - Last 5 rounds show complete dominance\n   - I've perfectly predicted their every move\n   - They've become extremely predictable\n\n2. Opponent's psychological state:\n   - Lost 5 consecutive rounds\n   - Likely in complete tilt\n   - Maximum frustration level\n   - Every strategy has failed\n   - May be completely demoralized\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - Their last moves: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - My last moves: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They've tried both defensive (rock) and aggressive (scissors)\n   - Nothing has worked for them\n\n4. Critical psychological breaking point:\n   - After 5 straight losses, players typically either:\n     * Make completely random moves\n     * Return to rock as a \"reset\" move\n     * Try something totally unexpected\n     * Or become totally predictable due to mental collapse\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - Rock just beat their scissors\n   - They might expect me to stay with rock\n   - Paper would beat rock if they try to reset\n   - But they might also try scissors out of desperation\n\nFinal decision: Given their complete frustration and the tendency for players to return to rock as a \"reset\" move after multiple losses (especially after losing with scissors), I'll choose paper. Rock is their most likely choice as they try to stabilize and reset their strategy.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent situation analysis:\n   - 5-win streak just ended with a tie\n   - Both played paper last round\n   - First tie after long streak of decisive rounds\n   - This might give them a psychological boost\n\n2. Psychology after breaking a streak:\n   - The tie breaks their losing spiral\n   - They might feel relieved to stop the losses\n   - Their decision-making might become clearer\n   - Could regain some confidence\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - My recent moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - Their recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - We ended up thinking alike last round\n   - This suggests similar strategic thinking\n\n4. Common post-tie behavior:\n   - Players typically switch moves after a tie\n   - Most expect their opponent to switch\n   - Some try to be clever by not switching\n   - The tie creates a strategic reset point\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - After a tie with paper, common responses are:\n     * Switch to scissors to beat expected paper\n     * Switch to rock expecting opponent's scissors\n     * Stay with paper hoping opponent overthinks\n   - The tie gives them a chance to reset strategy\n\nFinal decision: After a tie, most players switch their move. Given they finally broke their losing streak with paper, they're likely to feel more confident and make an aggressive play with scissors to beat potential repeated paper. I'll choose rock to counter their expected scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Last 3 rounds:\n     * Paper vs paper (tie)\n     * Rock vs rock (tie)\n     * Two consecutive ties\n   - History is repeating - similar to earlier game pattern\n\n2. Current situation:\n   - We're thinking very similarly again\n   - Two ties have reset the game momentum\n   - Previous winning/losing streaks are less relevant\n   - Playing field has leveled\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - Double ties create interesting dynamics:\n     * Both players want to break the mirroring\n     * Neither wants a third tie\n     * There's pressure to outsmart opponent\n     * But also risk of overthinking\n\n4. Pattern recognition:\n   - Earlier in game, similar paper\u2192rock ties occurred\n   - Last time after double ties, they played paper\n   - But they might remember that pattern\n   - They might expect me to remember it too\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - After double ties, players often:\n     * Try to break the synchronization\n     * Avoid obvious next moves\n     * Look for psychological advantage\n     * Make unexpected choices\n\nFinal decision: Given our rock tie and the natural progression, many would play paper next to beat rock. However, since we've been thinking alike and they might anticipate this obvious move, they're likely to play scissors to counter expected paper. I'll stay with rock to beat their likely scissors play.\n\n[move] rock\n"
