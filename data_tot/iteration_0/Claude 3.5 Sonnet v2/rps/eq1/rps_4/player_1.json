    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors with a completely unknown opponent:\n   - Rock, paper, and scissors each have equal 1/3 probability of being played\n   - Each move beats one option and loses to another\n   - No single move has an inherent advantage\n\n3. In the absence of any strategic information:\n   - Playing any move is theoretically equivalent\n   - Rock is often a common first move for many players as it feels \"strong\"\n   - Therefore, paper might be a good counter to this potential tendency\n\n4. However, if the opponent is thinking at this level, they might anticipate paper and play scissors.\n\n5. Given this uncertainty, I'll choose rock as my opening move:\n   - It's a solid defensive choice\n   - If opponent overthinks, they might not choose paper\n   - It provides a baseline for future rounds\n\n[move] rock\n"

Psychology for this round:\n   - The opponent succeeded with paper, which might:\n     a) Make them more likely to use paper again (success bias)\n     b) Make them less likely to use paper (avoiding predictability)\n   \n3. Considering my options:\n   - If they repeat paper, scissors would be optimal\n   - If they anticipate my scissors and switch to rock, I would lose\n   - If they think I'll play rock again, they might stick with paper\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - Scissors directly counters their previous successful move\n   - Even if they change strategies, scissors is no worse than any other choice against a random move\n   - The psychological advantage of countering their previous success makes scissors attractive\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at their sequence:\n   - They went paper \u2192 rock\n   - This shows they're not simply repeating successful moves\n   - They might be anticipating my countermoves\n\n3.
