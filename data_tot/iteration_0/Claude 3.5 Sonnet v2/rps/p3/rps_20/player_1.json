    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the risk/reward:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - But also the highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Rock and Scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1)\n\n4. Since this is the first move:\n   - I don't want to be too risky\n   - Rock is traditionally a common first move for many players\n   - Paper would beat the common rock choice\n   - The reward for paper beating rock (+3) is higher than other combinations\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - While paper has higher risk, the potential reward and likelihood of opponents choosing rock makes it worth trying\n   - This could establish a strong position early in the game\n\n[move] paper I choose paper as it offers the highest reward potential and could counter a common opening rock move.\n"

Analyzing the previous round:\n   - I chose paper and won against rock\n   - The opponent showed they might be a traditional/straightforward player by choosing rock first\n   - They lost 3 points, which might influence their next move\n\n2. Psychological consideration:\n   - After losing significantly (-3 points), players often change their strategy\n   - They might anticipate me playing paper again and try to counter it\n   - Common response would be to switch to scissors to beat my previous paper\n\n3. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they switch to scissors as predicted, rock would be my best counter\n   - If they stay with rock (less likely), paper would win again\n   - If they choose paper (possible but least likely), scissors would win\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock is the safest play here:\n     * Beats scissors (likely opponent move)\n     * Only loses to paper (less likely opponent move)\n     * Risk/reward ratio is better (+1/-3)\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given the psychological factors and risk assessment\n   - Rock provides good defense against the most likely opponent response\n   - Even if wrong, the potential loss is minimized\n\n[move] rock I choose rock to counter the likely scissors play after their previous loss.\n"

Behavioral analysis:\n   - The opponent has lost twice now (-3, -1 points)\n   - They might be frustrated and looking to break their losing streak\n   - They've shown a pattern of changing their move after each loss\n   - Their moves have rotated: rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3.
