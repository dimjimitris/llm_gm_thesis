Throughout the game, they've been excellent at predicting my strategic adjustments. I'm going to stick with rock again - while it might seem stubborn, it goes against the common urge to switch after a tie and might catch them if they try to counter an expected switch on my part.\n\n[move] rock Maintaining rock after the tie, resisting the obvious paper switch\n"
