    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock vs Scissors: +1/-1 points\n   - Paper vs Rock: +3/-3 points\n   - Scissors vs Paper: +1/-1 points\n\n3. Key observations:\n   - Paper has the highest potential payoff (+3 if it wins)\n   - Paper also has the highest potential loss (-3 if it loses)\n   - Rock and Scissors have more modest payoffs/losses (+1/-1)\n\n4. Strategic considerations for first move:\n   - Without prior information, all moves are equally likely from opponent\n   - Paper offers highest reward but also highest risk\n   - Rock or Scissors offer more balanced risk-reward\n\n5. Given this is the first move, I'll choose a balanced approach:\n   - I'll go with rock as it has moderate risk-reward\n   - It protects against scissors\n   - Even if I lose to paper, the penalty (-3) is acceptable given the information available\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern insights:\n   - Rock wins are often followed by:\n     * Opponent playing paper to counter\n     * Me losing when trying to predict their counter\n     * Complex mind games and adaptation\n   - Similar situation to Round 22\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - Opponent just lost to rock\n   - They've shown they:\n     * Adapt well after losses\n     * Counter predictable patterns\n     * Use paper effectively against rock\n     * Think multiple steps ahead\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If I repeat rock: likely to face paper (-3)\n   - If I play scissors: vulnerable to rock again (-1)\n   - If I play paper: could win big (+3) or lose small (-1)\n   - Need to consider opponent's strong adaptation skills\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Will play paper because:\n     * Breaks my pattern of rock success\n     * Has potential for high reward (+3)\n     * They might play rock again as it's been successful overall\n     * Shows aggressive adaptation rather than defensive play\n     * Even if they predict with scissors, only lose 1 point\n     * They haven't shown consistent scissors usage\n     * Takes initiative rather than reacting to their expected counter\n\n[move] paper\n"
