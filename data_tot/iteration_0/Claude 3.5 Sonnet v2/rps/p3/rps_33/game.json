Key observations:\n   - Paper has the highest potential payoff (+3 if it wins)\n   - Paper also has the highest potential loss (-3 if it loses)\n   - Rock and Scissors have more modest payoffs/losses (+1/-1)\n\n4. Strategic considerations for first move:\n   - Without prior information, all moves are equally likely from opponent\n   - Paper offers highest reward but also highest risk\n   - Rock or Scissors offer more balanced risk-reward\n\n5. Given this is the first move, I'll choose a balanced approach:\n   - I'll go with rock as it has moderate risk-reward\n   - It protects against scissors\n   - Even if I lose to paper, the penalty (-3) is acceptable given the information available\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current situation:\n   - I just had a big win with paper\n   - Opponent just lost significantly to paper\n   - Similar situation to Round 11 where I won with paper\n   - After that win, I played rock and lost badly\n\n3. Opponent psychology:\n   - They just lost to paper\n   - They're likely to:\n     * Avoid rock (their losing move)\n     * Try to counter paper with scissors\n     * Be aggressive to recover from loss\n   - They might remember how they successfully countered my post-win rock play before\n\n4. Pattern recognition:\n   - Must avoid repeating my Round 11 mistake (playing rock after paper win)\n   - Opponent has shown they learn from patterns\n   - They adapt well after losses\n   - They expect conservative plays after wins\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Will play scissors because:\n     * Counters their likely paper play if they try to mirror my success\n     * Meets their expected scissors play equally if they try to counter my paper\n     * Avoids the trap of playing rock (which they've punished consistently)\n     * Only risks -1 points if they play rock\n     * Shows adaptation rather than predictability\n     * Breaks the pattern of my previous post-win behavior\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Round 23: paper vs paper (tie)\n   - Round 24: rock (me) vs scissors (them) - I won (+1)\n   - Round 25: paper (me) vs rock (them) - I won big (+3)\n   - On a strong winning streak\n\n2. Current momentum:\n   - Two consecutive wins\n   - Just won with a high-scoring paper play\n   - Opponent lost significantly\n   - Similar to previous high-stakes situations\n\n3. Historical pattern recognition:\n   - After my paper wins:\n     * Opponent often uses scissors successfully\n     * They adapt quickly to big losses\n     * They punish predictable follow-ups\n     * They make aggressive recovery plays\n\n4. Opponent's likely mindset:\n   - Just lost heavily (-3)\n   - Will want to break my winning streak\n   - Likely to counter paper strategy\n   - May be more aggressive to recover points\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Will play rock because:\n     * Counters likely scissors play after their paper loss\n     * Opponent has historically used scissors to counter paper success\n     * Protects against aggressive recovery attempt\n     * Shows adaptation rather than staying with winning paper\n     * Reasonable risk (-3 if they read ahead with paper)\n     * They're less likely to use paper right after losing with rock\n     * Breaks the pattern they might expect after my paper win\n\n[move] rock\n"

Critical observations:\n   - Opponent successfully:\n     * Countered my rock play\n     * Used paper for big win\n     * Read my defensive strategy\n     * Recovered from their loss\n\n3.

Pattern observations:\n   - Recent trend of:\n     * Big swings with paper plays (+/-3)\n     * Successful counters to rock\n     * Multiple scissors ties\n     * Complex mind games\n\n3. After scissors tie psychology:\n   - Common responses include:\n     * Stick with scissors (triple bluff)\n     * Switch to rock to beat scissors\n     * Switch to paper to beat expected rock\n   - But opponent shows deeper thinking\n\n4. Risk/Reward analysis:\n   - Paper: Highest reward (+3) but risky vs scissors\n   - Rock: Safe against scissors but vulnerable to paper (-3)\n   - Scissors: Led to multiple ties\n   - Need to break tie pattern\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Will play paper because:\n     * Beats rock if they try to counter scissors\n     * Has highest reward potential (+3)\n     * Breaks the scissors tie pattern\n     * They might avoid scissors after multiple ties\n     * Even if they stick with scissors, only lose 1 point\n     * Shows unexpected aggression rather than defensive rock\n     * They haven't shown consistent scissors usage outside of ties\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern observations:\n   - Paper plays leading to big point swings\n   - Scissors ties occurring regularly\n   - Rock plays being punished\n   - Complex mind games developing\n\n3.

Risk/Reward analysis:\n   - Paper: Highest reward (+3) but risky against scissors\n   - Rock: Safe against scissors but vulnerable to paper (-3)\n   - Scissors: Could lead to another tie\n   - Need to break predictable patterns\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Will play paper because:\n     * Most unexpected move after scissors tie\n     * Beats rock if they try to counter scissors\n     * Has highest reward potential (+3)\n     * Opponent might avoid scissors after tie\n     * They've shown tendency to use rock after scissors plays\n     * Even if they stick with scissors, only lose 1 point\n     * Breaks the pattern of defensive plays after ties\n     * Shows willingness to take calculated risks\n\n[move] paper\n"
