    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and patterns\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n4. AI Assistant (me) - For coordinating and making the final decision\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors only offer 1 point. However, paper also risks the highest penalty (-3 points) if the opponent plays scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they have no prior information about our strategy. In such cases, players often default to rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the payoff structure, we should consider that:\n- Paper gives highest reward but highest risk\n- Rock and scissors have lower risk-reward profiles\n- Against a fresh player, a balanced approach might be best\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest playing paper because:\n1. It counters the common \"rock\" opening\n2. It offers the highest potential reward\n3. Even if we lose, we can learn from the opponent's first move\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. First-time players often choose rock, making paper a strategically sound choice.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on the collaboration, I'll make my move.\n\n[move] paper\nThis choice offers the highest potential reward and counters the common \"rock\" opening move from new players.\n"

They are also using strategic thinking\n2. They might anticipate us sticking to paper and adjust accordingly\n3. They might be pattern players who stick to the same move\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie, players often:\n- Switch to a different move to break the pattern\n- Try to predict their opponent's switch\n- Sometimes stubbornly stick to the same move expecting the opponent to switch\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that both players demonstrated strategic thinking with paper (highest reward potential), we should expect a more sophisticated response. If they expect us to stick with paper, they might switch to scissors. If they expect us to switch to rock (to counter potential scissors), they might stick to paper.\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, I suggest playing rock because:\n1. It protects against the likely scissors play from opponent\n2. Even if they stick to paper, we only risk -3 points\n3. It breaks the previous pattern\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The opponent has shown strategic thinking by choosing paper first, so they're likely to switch to scissors expecting us to repeat paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis makes sense.

Even if they play rock, we only risk -1 point\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. After two ties, players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent.
