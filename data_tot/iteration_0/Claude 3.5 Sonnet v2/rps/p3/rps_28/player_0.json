    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and patterns\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n4. Statistical Analyst - For probability analysis\n\nLet's start collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors only give 1 point. However, paper also risks the highest loss (-3 points). Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we should consider basic game theory principles.\n\nPsychology Expert: In first-time encounters, many players tend to choose rock as their initial move. This is a common psychological pattern as rock is perceived as a \"strong\" move.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the asymmetric payoff structure, paper is high-risk-high-reward, while scissors and rock have lower risk-reward profiles. Against a new player, we should balance potential gains against risks.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without prior data, each move has a theoretical 33.33% probability. However, considering the psychology expert's input about first-move bias toward rock, we might adjust these probabilities.\n\nGame Theorist: Based on these inputs, I suggest choosing paper. If the opponent plays rock (which is psychologically likely), we get the maximum 3 points. If they play scissors, we lose only 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. The potential 3-point gain outweighs the risk of losing 1 point to scissors, and paper also covers the psychologically likely rock play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

They may be an experienced player who anticipated our paper strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a successful move, players often tend to either:\n1. Stick with their winning move (scissors again)\n2. Anticipate that we'll switch to rock to counter their previous scissors, and thus they might switch to paper\n\nRisk Analyst: Our last move cost us -1 points. While not the worst possible outcome, we need to adjust our strategy. The opponent has shown they're willing to go against common first-move patterns.\n\nStatistical Analyst: With only one data point, we can't establish a strong pattern yet. However, the opponent's first move suggests they might be using more sophisticated strategies than basic first-move tendencies.\n\nGame Theorist: Given these insights, I recommend playing rock for this round. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with scissors (continuation behavior), we win with 1 point\n2. If they switch to paper (anticipating our rock), we lose 3 points\n3. If they switch to rock (completely new strategy), we tie\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. People who win with an unexpected move often become more predictable in the next round, either by repeating their success or by overthinking their next move.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock provides a good balance here. It protects against scissors repetition while not risking as much against paper as our previous move did.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

After a tie, players often:\n1. Feel a need to \"break the deadlock\" with a different move\n2. Try to outthink their opponent by predicting their next move\n3. Sometimes stubbornly stick to the same move, believing the opponent will change\n\nStatistical Analyst: So far, our opponent has played scissors\u2192rock. This could indicate they're cycling through moves in a strategic way. If they're following a classic rotation, paper might be next.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's look at our current position:\n- Total score: -1 points\n- Need to make up for early loss\n- Opponent has shown tactical flexibility\n\nGame Theorist: Given these factors, I suggest playing scissors. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they play paper (following a rotation pattern), we win 1 point\n2. If they stick with rock, we lose 1 point\n3. If they go back to scissors, we tie\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The tie situation often prompts players to switch moves, and paper would be a logical choice for them after rock, especially if they're trying to establish dominance after their early win.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors is a balanced choice here. The potential loss (-1) is manageable, and we have good chances of catching them if they switch to paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

However, they might also recognize that we'll eventually adapt to counter their rock strategy. At this point, they might:\n1. Continue with their successful rock strategy\n2. Anticipate our adaptation and switch to scissors\n3. Make a complete switch to paper to surprise us\n\nStatistical Analyst: Rock has appeared in 2/3 of their moves, and it's been especially successful in the last round. Statistical probability suggests a high likelihood of them sticking with a winning strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: We're down -2 points total. We need to take calculated risks to recover:\n- Paper would give us +3 against rock\n- But paper is vulnerable to scissors (-1)\n- Rock would be safe but only maintains status quo\n\nGame Theorist: Given our negative score and their clear rock preference, we need to take the calculated risk of playing paper. The potential 3-point gain outweighs the risk, especially given their demonstrated preference for rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Players who find success with a particular move (rock in this case) often develop an attachment to it. Even if they suspect we might play paper, they might stick with rock out of confidence or habit.\n\nRisk Analyst: While paper is risky, we're already in a negative position (-2 points).

Their strategic paper play suggests high-level thinking.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend scissors for this round. Here's why:\n1. After revealing paper as a surprise, they might stick with it to capitalize on their success\n2. If they return to scissors (their most frequent move), we tie\n3. If they play rock, we only lose 1 point\n4. We need to break out of our predictable rock pattern that they just punished\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. Players often feel emboldened after a successful surprise move and might repeat it. Additionally, they might expect us to avoid rock now after such a big loss, making paper an attractive option for them again.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors offers a balanced risk-reward profile here. We can't afford another -3 point loss, and scissors gives us a chance to catch them if they maintain paper while limiting our potential losses.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They might expect us to play rock to counter their potential paper repeat\n5. The three-tie streak creates pressure to break pattern\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. After three consecutive ties with different moves, they're likely to:\na) Return to their most comfortable move (scissors)\nb) Try to predict our counter to their paper play\nc) Avoid repeating paper since it's their least used move\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors provides a balanced risk-reward profile here. Their completion of a full move rotation suggests they might return to their most-used move (scissors), and even if they play rock, we only risk 1 point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Five consecutive ties is extraordinary!\n\nPsychology Expert: Unique psychological situation:\n- Five consecutive ties creates extreme pressure\n- Their last five moves have been: rock->paper->scissors->scissors->rock\n- They've matched our every move in this tie streak\n- The frustration level must be at its peak\n- They might be trying to read our pattern rather than create their own\n\nStatistical Analyst: Updated distribution:\n- Scissors: 11 times\n- Rock: 8 times (including last round)\n- Paper: 2 times\nLast five moves show they're using all options but favoring scissors/rock\n\nRisk Analyst: The five-tie streak maintains -3 points. This unprecedented streak suggests both players are reading each other's strategies closely.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend paper. Here's why:\n1. They've just used rock, and might stick with it out of frustration\n2. After five ties, they might avoid scissors (their usual go-to)\n3. They've only used paper twice, making it unlikely they'll choose it\n4. If they go back to scissors, we only lose 1 point\n5. The psychological pressure might make them stick with rock as a \"safe\" move\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly agree. Five consecutive ties creates a unique psychological state where:\na) Players often stick with their last move out of decision paralysis\nb) They avoid their most obvious strategy (scissors in their case)\nc) The pressure to break the tie streak might make them more predictable\nd) They might avoid their least comfortable move (paper) in this high-pressure situation\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper offers our best risk-reward ratio here. If they stick with rock (which seems likely given the extreme pressure), we gain 3 points. If they revert to scissors, we only lose 1 point.

They might feel overconfident after breaking the tie streak\n4. If they switch to paper, we're only one point worse than now\n5. Their extreme preference for scissors (12 times now) suggests they'll return to it\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed.

Their three consecutive scissors plays suggest they've become predictable under pressure.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend keeping rock. Here's why:\n1. After losing to rock, they often switch to rock themselves\n2. If they stubbornly stick with scissors (13 times used), we win again\n3. They rarely use paper (only 2 times in 23 rounds)\n4. Their recent predictability suggests possible tilt\n5. Rock has been our most successful move throughout the game\n\nPsychology Expert: I disagree. After three consecutive scissors and losing to rock, they're very likely to switch strategies. Historical patterns show they often switch to rock after losing to rock, but given their recent predictability, they might try to surprise us with paper, which they've used least.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given this disagreement, let's consider paper. Here's why:\n1. They've shown a pattern of switching to rock after losing to rock\n2. Paper gives us 3 points if they switch to rock\n3. If they stick with scissors, we only lose 1 point\n4. They're likely feeling pressured to change strategy after becoming so predictable\n5. The potential 3-point gain outweighs the 1-point risk\n\nAfter this discussion, I recommend paper.

They've returned to scissors after a long break!\n\nPsychology Expert: Critical analysis:\n- They successfully returned to scissors after many rounds\n- Their last seven moves: rock->rock->rock->paper->rock->scissors\n- They're showing increased unpredictability\n- They might feel renewed confidence in scissors after this win\n- They've successfully broken their rock-heavy pattern\n\nStatistical Analyst: Updated distribution:\n- Scissors: 14 times (including last round)\n- Rock: 12 times\n- Paper: 3 times\nFirst scissors play in several rounds\n\nRisk Analyst: We're still positive at +2 points. Their successful return to scissors shows they're adapting better.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend rock. Here's why:\n1. They just succeeded with scissors after a long break\n2. Success might encourage them to stick with scissors\n3. They might view this as a successful return to their original strategy\n4. If they switch to paper, we only lose 3 points when we're still positive\n5. They've shown a pattern of sticking with successful moves\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. After successfully returning to a previously abandoned strategy, players often:\na) Feel validated in their original approach\nb) Stick with what just worked\nc) Regain confidence in their primary strategy\nd) Become temporarily predictable due to renewed confidence\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock is our best option here. Their successful return to scissors might make them overconfident and predictable. Even if they switch to paper, we can afford the loss given our +2 position, and we need to protect against their possible return to their most-used move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"
