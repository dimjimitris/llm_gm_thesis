    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock gives highest points (3)\n   - Rock beating scissors gives 1 point\n   - Scissors beating paper gives 1 point\n\n3. Since this is a first move:\n   - Many players tend to choose rock as their first move\n   - Paper would be most profitable against rock (3 points)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I'd lose only 1 point\n   - If opponent chooses paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n4. Risk vs reward analysis:\n   - Paper has highest potential gain (3)\n   - With paper, worst case loss is -1\n   - This makes paper the most attractive risk/reward option\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Paper provides best balance of potential gain vs limited loss\n   - No prior patterns to consider\n   - Going with the statistically advantageous choice\n\n[move] paper\n"

Risk assessment:\n   - If they switch to paper (highly likely): scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they stay with scissors (unlikely after losses): rock wins (+1)\n   - If they use rock (defensive mirror): paper wins (+3)\n\n6. Final reasoning:\n   - Strong historical precedent of paper counter\n   - They need to break rock's success\n   - Paper has been their go-to counter\n   - Best to anticipate paper with scissors\n   - Scissors also safe against potential mind games\n\n[move] scissors\n"
