Since this is a first move:\n   - Many players tend to choose rock as their first move\n   - Paper would be most profitable against rock (3 points)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I'd lose only 1 point\n   - If opponent chooses paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n4. Risk vs reward analysis:\n   - Paper has highest potential gain (3)\n   - With paper, worst case loss is -1\n   - This makes paper the most attractive risk/reward option\n\n5.

Current streak analysis:\n   - Four consecutive wins:\n     * Rock vs scissors (+1)\n     * Scissors vs paper (+1)\n     * Paper vs rock (+3)\n   - Perfect read on opponent's moves\n   - Building significant momentum again\n\n2. Opponent psychology:\n   - Lost four straight rounds\n   - Last move was defensive (rock)\n   - Failed defensive strategy might trigger change\n   - Likely feeling frustrated and pressured\n   - Similar to their previous tilt situations\n\n3. Historical pattern matching:\n   - When losing to paper\n   - They often switch to scissors\n   - This happened multiple times in game\n   - Especially when under pressure\n\n4. Strategic depth:\n   - They need to break my prediction streak\n   - Scissors is logical counter to my paper win\n   - They know I might expect scissors\n   - But might be too tilted for complex strategy\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If they use scissors (logical counter): rock wins (+1)\n   - If they stay rock (unlikely after loss): paper wins (+3)\n   - If they use paper (complete switch): scissors wins (+1)\n\n6. Final reasoning:\n   - Given their historical responses\n   - After losing to paper, scissors is likely\n   - Their frustrated state supports this\n   - Rock would counter their probable scissors\n   - Also safest play against potential mind games\n\n[move] rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Current domination analysis:\n   - Seven consecutive wins:\n     * Perfect prediction streak continues\n     * Last three: scissors vs paper, paper vs rock\n     * Maintaining perfect read on opponent\n\n2. Opponent psychology:\n   - Lost seven straight rounds\n   - Following completely predictable patterns\n   - Just lost to paper with rock\n   - Historical pattern suggests scissors counter\n   - In worst psychological state of game\n\n3. Pattern consistency:\n   - When losing to paper\n   - They've consistently switched to scissors\n   - This pattern held true multiple times\n   - Even more likely in tilted state\n\n4. Meta-game consideration:\n   - They might finally realize their predictability\n   - Could try random move to break pattern\n   - But psychological tilt suggests basic responses\n   - Complex thinking unlikely in current state\n\n5. Risk analysis:\n   - If they use scissors (most likely): rock wins (+1)\n   - If they stay rock (unlikely after loss): paper wins (+3)\n   - If they use paper (pattern break): scissors wins (+1)\n\n6. Final reasoning:\n   - Seven straight losses suggest maximum tilt\n   - After paper loss, scissors is their pattern\n   - Too tilted for complex strategy\n   - Rock would counter their probable scissors\n   - Safe play with consistent success\n\n[move] rock\n",
        "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Dominant streak analysis:\n   - Seven consecutive wins:\n     * Perfect prediction streak continues\n     * Last three: scissors vs paper, paper vs rock\n     * Following opponent's psychological patterns\n\n2. Opponent's current state:\n   - Lost seven straight rounds\n   - Following completely predictable patterns\n   - Maximum tilt/frustration level\n   - Showing rock-paper-scissors basic cycle\n\n3. Pattern recognition:\n   - After losing to paper\n   - Historical tendency to switch to scissors\n   - This has happened multiple times\n   - Especially when heavily tilted\n\n4. Psychological dynamics:\n   - They're in worst position of game\n   - Likely to revert to aggressive move\n   - Scissors is aggressive counter to paper\n   - Might finally try to break their own pattern\n   - But tilt suggests basic reactions\n\n5. Risk analysis:\n   - If they use scissors (likely counter): rock wins (+1)\n   - If they stay rock (unlikely repeat): paper wins (+3)\n   - If they use paper (pattern break): scissors wins (+1)\n\n6. Final reasoning:\n   - Given their tilted state\n   - After paper loss, scissors is high probability\n   - Need to maintain simple counters\n   - Rock would beat their likely scissors\n   - Keep exploiting their predictable responses\n\n[move] rock\n"
