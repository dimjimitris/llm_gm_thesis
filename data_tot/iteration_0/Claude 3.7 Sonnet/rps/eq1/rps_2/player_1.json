    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n\n2. My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 16: rock\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: paper\n   \n3. I've now won 12 out of 18 rounds, with 6 ties and no losses\n\n4. Interestingly, my opponent has completed a standard cycle in their last three moves (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper)\n\n5. After tying with paper in round 18, they might:\n   a) Switch to rock (starting a new cycle)\n   b) Try scissors (to beat my paper if they think I'll repeat)\n   c) Stick with paper (thinking I might switch to rock)\n\n6. If they're continuing their standard cycle pattern, they would play rock next\n\n7. My last three moves have been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - This doesn't show a clear pattern, which makes it harder for them to predict\n\n8. Given our tie with paper, they might expect me to:\n   - Play paper again (thinking they'll switch to scissors)\n   - Switch to scissors (to beat their expected paper)\n   - Switch to rock (thinking they'll switch to scissors)\n\n9. The most straightforward adjustment after a tie is to try to win the next round by countering what they think I'll play again\n\n10. If they think I'll play paper again, they would play scissors\n\n11. However, given their apparent cycle pattern and the fact that rock would be next in their cycle, rock seems like a strong possibility\n\n12. Considering both their possible cycle continuation (rock) and their potential tactical response to our paper tie (scissors), scissors seems slightly more likely\n\n13. To counter their expected scissors, I should play rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this nineteenth round, reasoning that they'll most likely play scissors to counter my repeated paper play, though they might also play rock to continue their cycle.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: paper\n   - Round 19: paper\n   \n3. I've now won 12 out of 19 rounds, with 6 ties and 1 loss\n\n4. This was my first loss in the entire game, which is a significant event\n\n5. My opponent has now played paper twice in a row, breaking their previous cycle pattern\n\n6. After winning with paper in round 19, they might:\n   a) Stick with paper (thinking it's working for them)\n   b) Switch to scissors (anticipating I'll play paper to counter their paper)\n   c) Switch to rock (thinking I'll play scissors to counter their repeated paper)\n\n7. Given that they just had their first win, option (a) seems plausible - they might stick with what finally worked\n\n8. However, they might also expect me to adjust after my loss and play paper to beat their expected rock\n\n9. My last three moves have been rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - This doesn't show a clear pattern, but they might expect me to avoid rock after losing with it\n\n10. If they think I'll avoid rock and play paper, they would play scissors\n\n11. If they think I'll play scissors to counter their repeated paper, they would play rock\n\n12. Given that they've finally found success after 19 rounds, they're most likely to either:\n    - Stick with paper (banking on their success)\n    - Play scissors (expecting me to counter with paper)\n\n13. Between these two options, scissors seems slightly more likely as it's the more strategic adjustment expecting me to counter their previous winning move\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this twentieth round, reasoning that they'll most likely play scissors, expecting me to play paper to counter their previous winning paper move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After their first win in round 19, they switched from paper to rock and we tied\n\n5. After tying with rock in round 20, they might:\n   a) Stick with rock (thinking I might switch to scissors)\n   b) Switch to paper (to beat my expected rock)\n   c) Switch to scissors (thinking I'll switch to paper after our rock tie)\n\n6. Rock has been their most common move throughout the game (9 out of 20 rounds)\n   - This suggests it might be their default or comfort move, especially after uncertainty\n\n7. My last three moves have been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - After playing rock twice and getting a loss and a tie, they might expect me to switch\n\n8. If they think I'll switch to paper to beat their rock, they would play scissors\n\n9. However, given their history of often playing rock, especially after ties (see rounds 7-8, 13-14), they might stick with rock again\n\n10. Alternatively, they might try to replicate their only winning strategy by playing paper (which beat my rock in round 19)\n\n11. Considering all factors:\n    - Their tendency to play rock after ties suggests rock\n    - Their possible desire to replicate their only win suggests paper\n    - Their strategic thinking might lead them to play scissors expecting me to switch to paper\n\n12. Among these options, paper seems slightly more likely given that:\n    - It's their only proven winning move against me\n    - It would be a logical counter if they expect me to play rock again\n\n13. To counter their expected paper, I should play scissors\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this twenty-first round, reasoning that they'll most likely play paper to counter my repeated rock plays and/or try to replicate their only winning move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Additionally, they've played rock in 10 out of 21 rounds (almost 50% of the time), but recently they've had more success with it\n\n10. They might also notice that whenever I've played scissors (rounds 6, 9, 12, 15, 21), they've either lost or, most recently, won with rock\n\n11. This might reinforce their confidence in playing rock against my potential scissors\n\n12.

Additionally, I've now played scissors in 3 out of my last 4 moves, which might lead them to believe I favor scissors\n\n10. If they believe I favor scissors, they might play rock to counter\n\n11. Given their recent success with scissors and the complexity of our meta-game:\n    - They might stick with scissors, expecting me to overthink and play paper again\n    - They might play rock, expecting me to revert to scissors\n    - They're less likely to play paper as it would lose to both scissors and rock\n\n12. Between scissors and rock, scissors seems slightly more likely given their recent success with it\n\n13. To counter their expected scissors, I should play rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this twenty-fifth round, reasoning that they'll most likely stick with scissors after their recent win with it.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 23: scissors\n   - Round 24: scissors\n   - Round 25: paper\n   \n3. I've now won 12 out of 25 rounds, with 9 ties and 4 losses\n\n4. Significantly, they've won the last three rounds in a row, showing increasing strategic success\n\n5. Their pattern has shifted from scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors to scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n6. After winning with paper in round 25, they might:\n   a) Stick with paper (continuing their winning move)\n   b) Switch to scissors (thinking I'll play paper to counter their paper)\n   c) Switch to rock (thinking I'll play scissors to counter their paper)\n\n7. My last three moves have been scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - After losing with rock, they might expect me to switch to paper to counter their expected rock\n\n8. If they expect me to play paper, they would play scissors\n\n9. However, they've now won with both scissors and paper in the last few rounds\n   - This suggests they're reading my strategy well and adapting effectively\n\n10.

My last three moves have been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - After tying with rock, they might expect me to switch to paper to try to win\n\n8. If they expect me to play paper, they would play scissors\n\n9. Their pattern has evolved considerably throughout the game:\n   - Early on they had a predictable cycle\n   - Recently they've shown more strategic adaptation\n   - They've won several recent rounds by correctly anticipating my moves\n\n10.

We've now had three consecutive rounds where I've played rock\n   - This creates a strong expectation that I'll either continue with rock or switch\n\n7. If they expect me to play rock a fourth time, they would play paper to counter\n\n8. If they expect me to switch to paper (to counter their rock), they would play scissors\n\n9.

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 27: rock\n   - Round 28: rock\n   - Round 29: scissors\n   \n3. I've now won 12 out of 29 rounds, with 11 ties and 6 losses\n\n4. They've switched from playing rock three times in a row to playing scissors, winning against my paper\n\n5. They've now won three rounds in a row (rock vs scissors, rock vs scissors, scissors vs paper)\n   - This indicates significantly improved strategic play on their part\n\n6. After winning with scissors in round 29, they might:\n   a) Stick with scissors (continuing their winning move)\n   b) Switch to rock (to beat my expected scissors)\n   c) Switch to paper (thinking I'll play rock to counter their scissors)\n\n7. My last three moves have been rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - This completes a full cycle, making my next move harder to predict\n\n8.

Given that they just won with scissors and might expect me to counter with rock, paper seems like a plausible move for them\n\n14. However, rock has been their safest and most successful move overall\n\n15. Between paper and rock as their likely moves, rock seems slightly more probable given their overall history and success with it\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this thirtieth round, reasoning that they'll most likely revert to rock after their successful scissors play, expecting me to play scissors to counter their scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"
