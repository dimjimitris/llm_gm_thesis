    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing against a fresh player, so I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n2. In this situation, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n3. Since there's no strategic advantage to any particular move in the first round, I could choose randomly.\n4. However, some research suggests that rock is often chosen slightly more frequently by first-time players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n5. If I anticipate this tendency, choosing paper would give me a slight edge.\n6. But without confirmed information about this specific opponent, this is just a reasonable guess.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this first round as it might have a slight advantage against a new player who might favor rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I won the previous round by playing paper against my opponent's rock.\n2. Now I need to anticipate how my opponent might adjust their strategy.\n3. After losing with rock, many players will switch to a different move.\n4. The most straightforward adaptation would be for them to choose paper (which would have beaten my previous move) or scissors (which beats the paper I just played).\n5. Of these two options, scissors seems more likely since it directly counters my winning move.\n6. If I expect my opponent to play scissors, my best response would be rock.\n7. However, they might also anticipate this reasoning and stick with rock or switch to paper.\n8.

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 24: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 25: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 26: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 27: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's moves have consistently followed the sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   This confirms they're using a simple cyclical pattern of rock, paper, scissors.\n\n3. If they continue this pattern, they will play rock next.\n\n4. I've now won 26 out of 27 rounds by recognizing and exploiting this pattern.\n\n5. My opponent has shown absolutely no deviation from their pattern through twenty-seven rounds.\n\n6. If they play rock as the pattern suggests, my best counter would be paper.\n\n7. The pattern is completely established and there's virtually no chance they will deviate from it.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the rock I predict they'll play based on their established pattern.\n\n[move] paper\n"
