However, they might also think I'll anticipate this obvious move and switch to scissors myself, in which case they might stick with scissors or switch to rock.

        "Great! My scissors successfully beat their paper. Let me continue adapting my strategy.\n\n[move] Scissors\n\nI'm choosing scissors again for this round. Since my opponent played paper in the last round and lost to my scissors, they might switch to rock to counter my expected scissors. However, they might also think I'll anticipate this and switch to paper, in which case they might stick with paper again. By staying with scissors, I'm making a calculated decision that they might try paper again thinking I'll switch to rock expecting them to switch to scissors. This continues my approach of trying to read their patterns and stay one step ahead in our psychological game.\n"
