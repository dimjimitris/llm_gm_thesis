Since pattern breaks have been successful for me, I'll continue with this approach. Instead of playing rock again (which might be expected after a win), or scissors (which would follow the opponent's last move), I'll play paper. This counters a potential rock from my opponent while continuing my unpredictable play style.\n"

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

        "[move] Rock\n\nAfter another tie with scissors, I'll play rock. This continues the natural rock-paper-scissors progression that has frequently resulted in ties between us. However, given that my successful rounds have come from breaking expected patterns, my opponent might anticipate me doing something unexpected this time. By actually following the standard sequence with rock, I might catch them off guard if they're overthinking my strategy.\n",
        "[move] Rock\n\nWe've tied again with scissors. Given our history of frequent ties followed by successful pattern breaks, I'll play rock now. This is both the natural progression after scissors and a strong strategic choice. If my opponent plays scissors again, my rock will win. If they follow the progression to rock as well, we'll tie again. If they anticipate my move and play paper, I'll lose. Based on our game dynamics, rock seems optimal.\n",
        "[move] Rock\n\nWe've tied again with scissors. Following my successful strategy of breaking patterns at key moments, I'll play rock instead of returning to the beginning of the standard sequence (which would be rock anyway in this case). This choice counters scissors if my opponent plays it again, while acknowledging they might switch to paper expecting me to play rock. Given our history of multiple ties followed by strategic breaks, rock seems appropriate.\n"

        "[move] Scissors\n\nAfter yet another tie with rock, I'll break the expected sequence (which would suggest paper next) by playing scissors instead. This pattern-breaking approach has worked for me in previous rounds. If my opponent follows the standard progression and plays paper, my scissors will win. If they anticipate my deviation and play rock, I'll lose. Given our history of frequent ties and my occasional successful pattern breaks, this calculated risk seems worthwhile.\n",
        "[move] Scissors\n\nAfter yet another tie with rock, I'll break the expected sequence (which would suggest paper next) by playing scissors instead. This strategic deviation has worked for me twice before when I broke patterns. If my opponent plays the expected paper, my scissors will win.

        "[move] Scissors\n\nAfter yet another tie with rock, I'll skip the expected paper and jump straight to scissors. Breaking the standard sequence has worked for me before, and continuing to play predictably has resulted in ties. If my opponent plays the expected paper following our rock tie, my scissors will win. If they anticipate a pattern break and play rock, I'll lose. If they make the same unconventional choice, we'll tie again. I believe this strategic deviation gives me the best chance to win.\n"
