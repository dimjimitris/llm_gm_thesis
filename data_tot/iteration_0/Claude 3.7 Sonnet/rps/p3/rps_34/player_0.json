    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing against a fresh player, so I don't have any information about their past behavior or patterns.\n2. In the absence of information about the opponent, I should consider the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n3. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3).\n4. Rock and scissors both have lower potential rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n5. Since I have no prior data on my opponent, I'll consider what a typical first-time player might choose.\n6. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n7. If the opponent chooses rock, paper would beat it and give me +3 points.\n8. The risk of playing paper is that if they choose scissors, I lose only 1 point.\n9. This risk-reward ratio favors choosing paper for the first move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Given that they've stuck with rock for two rounds now, there's a reasonable chance they'll continue with it\n8. If they stick with rock, paper would be my best move (+3 points)\n9. If they switch to scissors anticipating my paper, I would lose 1 point\n10. If they switch to paper and I choose paper, it would be a tie\n11. The highest expected value comes from choosing paper, assuming there's a good chance they'll stick with rock again\n12. Even if they switch to scissors, the loss is only 1 point compared to the potential gain of 3 points\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round, anticipating they might stick with rock for a third time or at least considering the risk-reward ratio is favorable.\n\n[move] paper\n"

If they choose scissors as well, it would be another tie\n10. If they choose rock anticipating my scissors, I would lose 1 point\n11.

If they choose rock instead, I would lose 1 point\n10. If they choose scissors again, it would be a tie\n11. Given my consistent success in predicting their moves and their clear pattern, scissors seems the optimal choice\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, anticipating they'll choose paper to counter my previous rock move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: We both chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: We both chose scissors (tie)\n   - Round 3: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 4: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 5: We both chose scissors (tie)\n   - Round 6: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 7: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 8: We both chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 9: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 10: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 11: We both chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 12: We both chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 13: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 14: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 15: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 16: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 17: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 18: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 19: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 20: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 21: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 22: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 23: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 24: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 25: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 26: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won 3 points)\n2. My opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n3. My recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n4. I've now won 19 consecutive rounds where there was a winner, demonstrating perfect prediction ability.\n5. My opponent's pattern remains absolutely consistent throughout the entire game: they choose the move that would have beaten my previous move.\n6. Now I need to consider what they might do next:\n   - Based on their pattern, they would choose scissors (to beat my paper)\n   - They've shown no deviation from this pattern in 26 rounds\n   - There's virtually no chance they'll change their strategy now\n7. Given their extremely consistent pattern throughout the game, they're almost certainly going to choose scissors\n8. To counter their anticipated scissors move, rock would be my best choice\n9. If they choose paper instead, I would lose 3 points\n10. If they choose rock again, it would be a tie\n11. Given my consistent success in predicting their moves and their unwavering pattern, rock seems the optimal choice\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, anticipating they'll choose scissors to counter my previous paper move.\n\n[move] rock\n"
