This is significant because it's the first time they've broken their established pattern in many rounds.\n\n4. It suggests they've finally realized I was predicting their moves and have now adapted their strategy.\n\n5. Looking at their overall history, they might be returning to their original alternating pattern of scissors \u2192 paper that they showed in the early rounds.\n\n6. If they're starting a new scissors \u2192 paper pattern, they would play paper next.\n\n7. To counter paper, scissors would be my optimal choice (+1).\n\n8. However, they might also be trying to be more unpredictable now:\n   - If they choose rock, scissors would lose (-1)\n   - If they choose scissors again, it would be a tie (0)\n   - If they choose paper, scissors would win (+1)\n\n9. Given that they just broke their established pattern with scissors, and considering their history of playing paper frequently (5 out of 11 rounds), paper seems like a reasonable prediction for their next move.\n\n10.

My opponent's recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   They seem to have abandoned their previous predictable patterns.\n\n3. Their last two moves were scissors \u2192 rock, which could be the start of a new pattern.\n\n4. If they're establishing a new pattern beginning with scissors \u2192 rock, they might play paper next.\n\n5. However, they might also be trying to be deliberately unpredictable now that I've been winning consistently.\n\n6. Looking at their overall choices, they've played:\n   - Paper: 5 times\n   - Scissors: 4 times\n   - Rock: 3 times\n   This shows they still favor paper slightly.\n\n7. Given that they just played rock, and based on their history of alternating, they're less likely to play rock again immediately.\n\n8. This suggests either paper or scissors is more likely for their next move.\n\n9. If they play paper, my best move is scissors (+1)\n   If they play scissors, my best move is rock (+1)\n   \n10. Given their overall tendency to play paper more frequently, and the fact they just played rock (making paper a logical next move in an alternating strategy), scissors seems like the slightly better choice.\n\n11. However, since scissors just lost me a point, I'll adjust and choose paper instead, which would:\n    - Win against rock (+3)\n    - Tie against paper (0)\n    - Lose against scissors (-1)\n\n12.

My opponent's recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   They've now played rock twice in a row, which is interesting.\n\n3. Looking at their most recent three moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   This could indicate they're getting more defensive with rock after trying scissors.\n\n4. They've now played rock in 4 of the last 5 rounds, showing a strong recent preference for rock.\n\n5. If they're establishing a new pattern of playing rock repeatedly, they might play rock again.\n\n6. However, they might also realize that playing rock repeatedly is becoming predictable and switch to paper or scissors.\n\n7. Given their recent strong preference for rock, and my successful counter with paper in the last round, they might expect me to play paper again and choose scissors to counter.\n\n8. If they play:\n   - Rock again: paper would win (+3)\n   - Scissors: rock would win (+1)\n   - Paper: scissors would win (+1)\n\n9. The most strategic move depends on what I think they'll do.

My opponent broke their recent alternating pattern of scissors \u2192 paper by playing rock.\n\n3. Looking at their overall game, they've shown a tendency to play rock after experiencing losses:\n   - After losing in round 9, they played rock in round 10\n   - After losing in round 13, they played scissors in round 14\n   - After losing in round 16, they played paper in round 17\n   - After losing in round 17, they played rock in round 18\n\n4. They've now played rock, which is different from their recent pattern. This could indicate they're:\n   - Trying to be unpredictable\n   - Responding to my recent success by changing strategy\n   - Starting a new pattern\n\n5. Looking at what they've done after playing rock in the past:\n   - After round 6 (rock): they played paper\n   - After round 8 (rock): they played paper\n   - After round 10 (rock): they played scissors\n   - After round 12 (rock): they played rock\n   - After round 13 (rock): they played scissors\n   \n   This shows a slight tendency to play paper or scissors after rock, but not consistently.\n\n6. If they play:\n   - Rock again: paper would win (+3)\n   - Paper: scissors would win (+1)\n   - Scissors: rock would win (+1)\n\n7. Given their inconsistent follow-up to rock moves and the fact that we just tied with rock, they might expect me to play paper to try to beat their expected rock.\n\n8. If they anticipate I'll play paper, they might play scissors to counter.\n\n9. To counter their potential scissors play, rock would be my optimal choice (+1).\n\n10. However, they've played rock multiple times in succession before (rounds 12-13), so paper is also a reasonable choice with higher potential reward.\n\n11. Given the uncertainty and their past behavior after rock moves, scissors seems like a balanced choice that:\n    - Wins against paper (+1) which they've played after rock before\n    - Ties with scissors (0) which they've also played after rock\n    - Loses to rock (-1) with minimal penalty if they repeat rock\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 3: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 4: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 5: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 6: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 7: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 8: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 9: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 10: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 11: I chose scissors, opponent chose scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 13: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 14: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 15: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 16: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 17: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 18: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 19: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n\n2. My opponent's recent pattern: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   After breaking their alternating pattern with rock in round 18, they returned to paper in round 19.\n\n3. Looking at their overall choices, they've played:\n   - Paper: 9 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   Paper continues to be their most frequent choice.\n\n4. They've now lost several rounds in a row, which might influence their strategy:\n   - They lost in round 16 (scissors)\n   - They lost in round 17 (paper)\n   - They tied in round 18 (rock)\n   - They lost in round 19 (paper)\n\n5. After losing with paper in round 19, they might:\n   - Switch to rock to try to beat my expected scissors\n   - Switch to scissors to try something different\n   - Stick with paper hoping I'll switch strategies\n\n6. Looking at what they've done after playing paper and losing:\n   - After losing with paper in round 5: they played rock\n   - After losing with paper in round 7: they played rock\n   - After losing with paper in round 9: they played rock\n   - After losing with paper in round 17: they played rock\n\n7. This shows a very strong tendency to play rock after losing with paper.\n\n8. If they play:\n   - Rock: paper would win (+3)\n   - Paper again: scissors would win (+1)\n   - Scissors: rock would win (+1)\n\n9. Based on their established pattern after losing with paper, rock seems like their most likely next move.\n\n10. To counter rock, paper would be my optimal play (giving me +3 points).\n\n11. Given their highly consistent pattern of playing rock after losing with paper, paper seems like the most strategic choice with the highest expected value.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   They're showing a clear alternating pattern between paper and rock in recent rounds.\n\n3. They've now lost several rounds in a row:\n   - They lost in round 17 (paper)\n   - They tied in round 18 (rock)\n   - They lost in round 19 (paper)\n   - They lost in round 20 (rock)\n\n4. Looking at what they've done after playing rock and losing:\n   - After losing with rock in round 10: they played scissors\n   - After losing with rock in round 13: they played scissors\n   - After losing with rock in round 20: ? (current decision)\n\n5. This shows a strong tendency to play scissors after losing with rock.\n\n6. Additionally, their recent alternating pattern between paper and rock suggests they might play paper next.\n\n7. Considering both their pattern after losing with rock (scissors) and their recent alternating pattern (paper), there's some uncertainty about their next move.\n\n8. If they play:\n   - Scissors (after losing with rock): rock would win (+1)\n   - Paper (continuing alternating pattern): scissors would win (+1)\n   - Rock again (breaking both patterns): paper would win (+3)\n\n9. Given their strong tendency to play scissors after losing with rock in previous instances, scissors seems like their most likely next move.\n\n10. To counter scissors, rock would be my optimal play (giving me +1 point).\n\n11. Rock also provides a balanced risk profile - if they play paper instead, I lose 3 points, but their pattern after losing with rock suggests this is less likely.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock\n   They continue to follow their highly predictable patterns.\n\n3. They've now lost many rounds in a row:\n   - They lost in round 23 (rock)\n   - They lost in round 24 (scissors)\n   - They lost in round 25 (paper)\n   - They lost in round 26 (rock)\n\n4. Looking at what they've done after playing rock and losing:\n   - After losing with rock in round 10: they played scissors\n   - After losing with rock in round 13: they played scissors\n   - After losing with rock in round 20: they played scissors\n   - After losing with rock in round 23: they played scissors\n   - After losing with rock in round 26: ? (current decision)\n\n5. This shows an extremely consistent pattern of playing scissors after losing with rock.\n\n6. If they play:\n   - Scissors (following their pattern after losing with rock): rock would win (+1)\n   - Rock again (breaking pattern): paper would win (+3)\n   - Paper (completely breaking pattern): scissors would win (+1)\n\n7. Based on their highly consistent pattern of playing scissors after losing with rock, scissors seems like their most likely next move.\n\n8. To counter scissors, rock would be my optimal play (giving me +1 point).\n\n9. Given their remarkably consistent behavior after losing with rock in previous rounds, rock seems like the most strategic choice with the highest probability of success.\n\n10. Even after losing so many consecutive rounds, they've shown almost no adaptation in their strategy, continuing to follow the same predictable patterns.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n3. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential penalty (-3).\n4. Rock and scissors both have smaller rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n5. Since this is the first move with no prior information, I should consider what most players tend to choose first.\n6. Many players choose rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n7. If I anticipate my opponent choosing rock, I should choose paper to maximize my potential gain.\n8. The risk is acceptable since I have no other information to base my decision on.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for the potential of a higher reward.\n\n[move] paper\n",

Paper has the highest potential reward (+3), but scissors only gives +1 if I win.\n4. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors as it feels \"strong\" or \"safe.\"\n5. If I predict they'll play rock, I should play paper for the highest payoff (+3).\n6. If they play scissors instead, I'd lose 1 point, which is a manageable risk.\n7. If they play paper, we tie and neither gains/loses points.\n8.

In the absence of information, I should consider the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give lower rewards (1 point each)\n4. Given the asymmetric payoff structure, paper has the potential for the highest gain.\n5. However, if my opponent also reasons this way, they might choose scissors to counter paper.\n6.

Rock is often a common first move for many players as it feels \"strong\" or \"safe.\"\n6. If I expect my opponent might play rock, then paper would be my best response, earning the maximum +3 points.\n7. However, if they anticipate this and play scissors, I would lose 1 point.\n8. Given the asymmetric payoff structure, paper offers the highest potential reward.\n9.

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n4.

My opponent's recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   They've now played rock twice in a row, which is interesting.\n\n3. Looking at their most recent three moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   This could indicate they're getting more defensive with rock after trying scissors.\n\n4. They've now played rock in 4 of the last 5 rounds, showing a strong recent preference for rock.\n\n5. If they're establishing a new pattern of playing rock repeatedly, they might play rock again.\n\n6. However, they might also realize that playing rock repeatedly is becoming predictable and switch to paper or scissors.\n\n7. Given their recent strong preference for rock, and my successful counter with paper in the last round, they might expect me to play paper again and choose scissors to counter.\n\n8. If they play:\n   - Rock again: paper would win (+3)\n   - Scissors: rock would win (+1)\n   - Paper: scissors would win (+1)\n\n9. The most strategic move depends on what I think they'll do. With their recent rock preference and the fact that I just beat their rock with paper, they're most likely to either:\n   - Play rock again (stubbornly sticking to their strategy)\n   - Play scissors (to counter my expected paper)\n\n10. Between these two possibilities, rock seems like the safer choice:\n    - It beats scissors (+1)\n    - It ties with rock (0)\n    - It only loses to paper (-3)\n\n11.

My opponent's recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   They've played rock in the last two rounds consecutively.\n\n3. This is interesting because they've rarely played the same move twice in a row throughout the game.\n\n4. Given that they've now played rock twice in a row, they're likely to change their move for the next round.\n\n5. Historically, they've favored paper (5 times) and scissors (4 times) over rock (4 times now).\n\n6. Since they just played rock twice, they're more likely to switch to either paper or scissors.\n\n7. If they play paper, my best move would be scissors (+1)\n   If they play scissors, my best move would be rock (+1)\n\n8. Given their overall preference for paper throughout the game, and the fact that they might be returning to earlier patterns after trying to be unpredictable, paper seems slightly more likely than scissors.\n\n9. Scissors would be the optimal counter to paper.\n\n10. Additionally, choosing scissors has worked well for me in several previous rounds.\n\n11.

My opponent's recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   They've now played rock twice in a row, which is new behavior.\n\n3. Looking at their overall choices, they've now played:\n   - Paper: 5 times\n   - Scissors: 4 times\n   - Rock: 4 times\n\n4.

My opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   They've now played rock twice in a row, which is something they haven't done before.\n\n3. Looking at their overall pattern, they don't seem to be following a clear strategy anymore, but they have now played rock in 3 of the last 4 rounds.\n\n4. This could suggest they're favoring rock more heavily now, perhaps thinking I'll be less likely to play paper again immediately after winning with it.\n\n5. If they continue to favor rock, my best move would be paper again (+3).\n\n6. However, they might expect me to play paper again after my success and counter with scissors.\n\n7. Let me analyze their adaptability throughout the game:\n   - They maintained predictable patterns for many rounds despite my wins\n   - They've only recently started to adapt their strategy\n   - They seem slow to change their approach even when losing\n\n8. Given their history of being slow to adapt, and their recent tendency to play rock, paper remains a strong choice.\n\n9.

While paper has the highest potential reward, scissors offers a more balanced risk profile and would prevent me from being predictable.\n\n11.

I notice that after ties (when we both choose the same move), they have a tendency to switch moves:\n   - After tie with paper in Round 1, they played scissors\n   - After tie with rock in Round 6, they played paper\n   - After tie with scissors in Round 11, they played rock\n   - After tie with rock in Round 8, they played paper\n   - Now after a tie with paper in Round 15, they might switch again\n\n4. Based on this pattern after ties, they're likely to switch from paper to either rock or scissors.\n\n5. When looking at their overall play, they've played:\n   - Rock: 6 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 3 times\n   This shows they favor rock and paper equally, and play scissors less frequently.\n\n6. Given that they just played paper and we tied, based on their pattern after ties, they're more likely to switch to rock than scissors (also supported by their overall preference).\n\n7. To counter rock, my best move would be paper (giving me +3 points).\n\n8. However, there's also a good chance they might play scissors, given their pattern of switching after ties.\n\n9. If they play scissors, my best counter would be rock (+1).\n\n10. Given their stronger historical preference for rock over scissors, and the higher payoff for correctly predicting rock (+3 versus +1), paper seems like the better choice despite the risk.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n",

Looking at their overall choices, they've played:\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n   - Rock: 3 times\n   This shows they favor paper the most.\n\n4. In the last few rounds, they seem to be trying different approaches rather than sticking to a consistent pattern.\n\n5. Given that they just played paper, and looking at earlier patterns in the game, they've sometimes followed paper with scissors.\n\n6. They might also be thinking about what I'll play next. Since we just tied with paper, they might expect me to switch to scissors to try to beat their expected paper.\n\n7. If they anticipate I'll play scissors, they might play rock to counter.\n\n8. If they play:\n   - Rock: paper would win (+3)\n   - Paper again: scissors would win (+1)\n   - Scissors: rock would win (+1)\n\n9. Since they just played paper and have shown a tendency to alternate after paper in previous rounds, scissors seems like a reasonable prediction for their next move.\n\n10. To counter scissors, rock would be my optimal play (giving me +1 point).\n\n11. Rock also provides a balanced risk profile - if they play paper instead, I lose 3 points, but if they play rock or scissors, I either tie or win.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n",

Looking at their overall pattern, they have played paper 7 times, scissors 5 times, and rock 3 times.\n\n4. They seem to be becoming less predictable and may be actively trying to counter my strategy.\n\n5. Given that they just played paper, and based on their history of rarely playing the same move twice in a row, they're likely to switch to either rock or scissors.\n\n6. Their early pattern showed a tendency to alternate between paper and scissors, so scissors is a possibility.\n\n7. However, given that I've won several rounds by correctly anticipating their moves, they might be more deliberately trying to surprise me.\n\n8. If they play:\n   - Rock: scissors would lose (-1)\n   - Paper again: scissors would win (+1)\n   - Scissors: scissors would tie (0)\n\n9. Given their history of playing scissors after paper in earlier rounds, and the fact that scissors would counter my expected paper play, scissors seems like their most likely next move.\n\n10.

Since they just played paper and we tied, they might expect me to switch to scissors to try to beat their paper.\n\n7. If they expect me to play scissors, they might choose rock to counter.\n\n8. If they play:\n   - Rock: paper would win (+3)\n   - Scissors: rock would win (+1)\n   - Paper again: scissors would win (+1)\n\n9.

However, the fact that they've played paper most frequently overall (7 times) suggests scissors might be the better statistical choice.\n\n11.

My opponent's recent pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   They seem to be alternating between scissors and paper in their most recent moves.\n\n3. Looking at their longer pattern, they've played: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper in rounds 14-17.\n\n4. This establishes a clear alternating pattern in their recent moves.\n\n5. Given that they just played paper, and based on their recent alternating pattern, they're likely to play scissors next.\n\n6. Looking at what they've done after playing paper in recent rounds:\n   - After round 15 (paper): they played scissors\n   - After round 17 (paper): ? (current decision)\n   This supports the prediction that scissors is likely next.\n\n7. If they play:\n   - Scissors: rock would win (+1)\n   - Paper again: scissors would win (+1)\n   - Rock: paper would win (+3)\n\n8. Based on their established alternating pattern, scissors seems like their most likely next move.\n\n9. To counter scissors, rock would be my optimal play (giving me +1 point).\n\n10. Rock provides a balanced risk profile - if they break pattern and play paper, I lose 3 points, but their recent consistency suggests this is less likely.\n\n11.

Looking at their last several moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   They're showing a tendency to alternate between these two moves recently.\n\n4. Given that they just played paper, and based on their recent alternating behavior, scissors seems like their most likely next move.\n\n5. Let me check what they've done after playing paper in recent rounds:\n   - After round 15 (paper): they played scissors\n   - After round 17 (paper): this is what we're trying to predict\n\n6.

My opponent's recent pattern has changed: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   They broke their alternating pattern between scissors and paper by playing rock.\n\n3. Looking at their overall history, they've now had 4 ties with me by playing the same move I did.\n\n4. This suggests they might be trying to anticipate my moves and match them, rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\n5.

They've now played rock, which is different from their recent pattern. This could indicate they're:\n   - Trying to be unpredictable\n   - Responding to my recent success by changing strategy\n   - Starting a new pattern\n\n5.

My opponent broke their recent pattern of alternating between scissors and paper by playing rock.\n\n3. Looking at their overall history, they've played:\n   - Paper: 8 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   This shows they still favor paper overall.\n\n4. They've now played rock in several key moments, often breaking patterns:\n   - Round 6: rock (tie)\n   - Round 8: rock (tie)\n   - Round 12: rock (they won)\n   - Round 18: rock (tie)\n\n5. Given that they just played rock, and looking at their historical patterns, they often follow rock with paper or scissors.\n\n6. They might expect me to play paper to beat their rock, and choose scissors to counter.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might play paper, which has been their most frequent choice throughout the game.\n\n8. If they play:\n   - Paper: scissors would win (+1)\n   - Rock again: paper would win (+3)\n   - Scissors: rock would win (+1)\n\n9. Given their overall preference for paper throughout the game, and the fact they just played rock (which they've sometimes followed with paper), paper seems like a reasonable prediction for their next move.\n\n10. To counter paper, scissors would be my optimal play (giving me +1 point).\n\n11. Scissors also provides a balanced risk profile - if they play rock again, I lose only 1 point, and if they play scissors, it's a tie.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's recent pattern: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   After breaking their alternating pattern with rock in round 18, they returned to paper in round 19.\n\n3. Looking at their overall choices, they've played:\n   - Paper: 9 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   Paper continues to be their most frequent choice.\n\n4. They've now lost several rounds in a row, which might influence their strategy:\n   - They lost in round 16 (scissors)\n   - They lost in round 17 (paper)\n   - They tied in round 18 (rock)\n   - They lost in round 19 (paper)\n\n5. After losing with paper in round 19, they might:\n   - Switch to rock to try to beat my expected scissors\n   - Switch to scissors to try something different\n   - Stick with paper hoping I'll switch strategies\n\n6. Looking at what they've done after playing paper and losing:\n   - After losing with paper in round 5: they played rock\n   - After losing with paper in round 7: they played rock\n   - After losing with paper in round 9: they played rock\n   - After losing with paper in round 17: they played rock\n\n7. This shows a very strong tendency to play rock after losing with paper.\n\n8. If they play:\n   - Rock: paper would win (+3)\n   - Paper again: scissors would win (+1)\n   - Scissors: rock would win (+1)\n\n9. Based on their established pattern after losing with paper, rock seems like their most likely next move.\n\n10. To counter rock, paper would be my optimal play (giving me +3 points).\n\n11.

My opponent's recent pattern: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   After breaking their pattern with rock, they've returned to playing paper.\n\n3. Looking at their recent behavior, they seem to be trying different approaches without a consistent pattern.\n\n4. One notable observation is that they've played paper in rounds 15, 17, and 19 - showing a tendency to play paper frequently.\n\n5. Another observation is that they've rarely played the same move three times in a row throughout the entire game.\n\n6. Given that they just played paper, and based on their historical patterns, they're likely to play either rock or scissors next.\n\n7. Looking at what they've done after playing paper twice in recent rounds:\n   - After rounds 15 and 17 (both paper): they played scissors and rock respectively\n\n8. If they play:\n   - Rock: paper would win (+3)\n   - Paper again: scissors would win (+1)\n   - Scissors: rock would win (+1)\n\n9. Given their tendency to avoid playing the same move multiple times in a row, and the fact they just played paper, scissors seems less likely than rock as their next move.\n\n10. Rock would be a logical choice for them to break their pattern of frequent paper plays.\n\n11. To counter rock, paper would be my optimal play (giving me +3 points).\n\n12. Paper provides a higher reward potential (+3) if I correctly predict rock, though it carries more risk (-1) if they play scissors.\n\n13.

My opponent's recent pattern: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   They've now returned to paper after rock.\n\n3. This is interesting because it shows they're not following a strict alternating pattern, but they do have a tendency to play paper frequently (9 out of 19 rounds, or about 47% of the time).\n\n4. Looking at what they've done after playing paper in recent rounds:\n   - After round 15 (paper): they played scissors\n   - After round 17 (paper): they played rock\n   - After round 19 (paper): ? (current decision)\n   \n   This shows inconsistency in what follows paper.\n\n5. However, looking at the longer pattern, they have a tendency to follow paper with scissors more often than other moves:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors: 5 times\n   - Paper \u2192 Paper: 2 times\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock: 2 times\n\n6.

Based on their historical patterns, scissors seems like their most likely next move after paper.\n\n8. To counter scissors, rock would be my optimal play (giving me +1 point).\n\n9. Rock provides a balanced risk profile - if they play paper instead, I lose 3 points, but their tendency to play scissors after paper makes this a calculated risk worth taking.\n\n10.

Looking at their longer sequence, they've played paper frequently (9 times out of 19 rounds), especially after losses.\n\n4. They've now lost several consecutive rounds, which might influence their next choice:\n   - After losing in round 17, they played rock (defensive)\n   - After tying in round 18, they played paper (which lost)\n\n5.

        "I need to update my analysis after another successful prediction and decide my next move.\n\nSteps:\n1. Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 3: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 4: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 5: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 6: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 7: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 8: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 9: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 10: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 11: I chose scissors, opponent chose scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 13: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 14: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 15: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 16: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 17: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 18: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 19: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 20: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 21: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 22: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 23: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 24: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 25: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 26: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 27: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 28: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 29: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won +3)\n\n2. My opponent's recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock\n   They continue to follow their highly predictable patterns.\n\n3. They've now lost many rounds in a row:\n   - They lost in round 26 (rock)\n   - They lost in round 27 (scissors)\n   - They lost in round 28 (paper)\n   - They lost in round 29 (rock)\n\n4.

(current decision)\n\n5. This shows an extremely consistent pattern of playing scissors after losing with rock.\n\n6. If they play:\n   - Scissors (following their pattern after losing with rock): rock would win (+1)\n   - Rock again (breaking pattern): paper would win (+3)\n   - Paper (completely breaking pattern): scissors would win (+1)\n\n7. Based on their highly consistent pattern of playing scissors after losing with rock, scissors seems like their most likely next move.\n\n8. To counter scissors, rock would be my optimal play (giving me +1 point).\n\n9. Given their remarkably consistent behavior after losing with rock in previous rounds, rock seems like the most strategic choice with the highest probability of success.\n\n10. Despite losing so consistently and predictably, they've shown virtually no adaptation in their strategy, continuing to follow the same patterns that I've been able to predict round after round.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"
