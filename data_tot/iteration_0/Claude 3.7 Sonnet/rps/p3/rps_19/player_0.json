    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My total score is now +2 (5-3=2).\n\nLet's analyze our recent pattern:\n- Round 22: Paper vs Paper (tie, 0)\n- Round 23: Paper vs Rock (I won, +3)\n- Round 24: Rock vs Scissors (I won, +1)\n- Round 25: Scissors vs Rock (I lost, -1)\n- Round 26: Paper vs Scissors (I lost, -1)\n- Round 27: Rock vs Paper (I lost, -3)\n\nMy opponent has now won three consecutive rounds by correctly anticipating and countering my moves. They've shown good adaptability in their strategy.\n\nAfter winning with paper against my rock, my opponent might:\n1. Stay with paper since it just worked\n2. Switch to scissors anticipating I'll play paper to counter their paper\n3. Switch to rock expecting me to play scissors to counter their expected scissors\n\nGiven their three consecutive wins, they've clearly found a way to predict my moves effectively. I need to break this pattern and be less predictable.\n\nSince they've been successfully countering my moves, I'll try to disrupt their expectations. Instead of making the \"logical\" next move in the sequence, I'll play scissors. This would beat their paper if they repeat it, and would tie with scissors if they switch.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
