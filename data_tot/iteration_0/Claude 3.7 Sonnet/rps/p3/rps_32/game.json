Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I have no pattern to analyze.\n3. In the absence of information, I need to consider common first-move tendencies in rock-paper-scissors.\n4. Research suggests rock is often the most common first move for many players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n5. If my opponent plays rock, paper would give me the highest possible payoff (3 points).\n6. The downside risk of playing paper is losing 1 point to scissors, which is less than the 3 points I'd lose if I played rock against paper.\n7. Paper offers a good risk-reward balance for a first move against an unknown opponent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for the first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They've now played scissors in 8 out of 11 rounds, showing an extraordinary commitment to this move.\n\n4. They've played scissors five times in a row now, despite losses and ties.\n\n5. This level of persistence with scissors defies conventional game theory and suggests:\n   a) They have an extremely strong bias toward scissors\n   b) They're executing a peculiar strategy hoping I'll eventually switch away from countering scissors\n   c) They're not actively adapting their strategy at all\n\n6. Given five consecutive scissors plays, the probability that they'll play scissors again remains surprisingly high based on their demonstrated pattern.\n\n7. However, even with this pattern, there must be some threshold where they would consider switching.\n\n8. If they do finally switch, paper would be their logical choice to counter my frequent rock plays.\n\n9. Rock has been my most successful move in this match, winning against their scissors multiple times.\n\n10. Given their extreme scissors preference, rock remains the highest expected value play, despite the risk they might finally switch to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This behavior is so consistent that it appears to be either:\n   a) A deliberate strategy to make me doubt my rock play eventually\n   b) A player who has a very strong preference for scissors regardless of outcome\n   c) A player who might not be adjusting strategy based on game results\n\n6. At this point, expecting them to switch away from scissors would contradict the strong pattern they've established.\n\n7. However, there is always the possibility that they're setting up for a strategic switch after conditioning me to expect scissors.\n\n8.

Looking at recent rounds, they seem to be getting better at predicting my moves and countering them.\n\n5. They've now used paper successfully against my rock twice in the last 6 rounds.\n\n6. After winning with paper against my rock, they might:\n   a) Continue with paper, expecting me to play rock again\n   b) Switch to scissors, anticipating I'll play paper to counter their paper\n   c) Play rock, expecting me to play scissors to counter their paper\n\n7. Given their success with paper in this situation before, and their pattern of occasionally repeating successful moves, option (a) seems plausible.\n\n8. However, they've also shown they can make strategic switches to stay ahead of my strategy.\n\n9. If they do play paper again, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n10. Given their recent success with paper against my rock, and the psychological tendency to repeat successful strategies, scissors offers the best expected value.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've now used all three moves in the last three rounds: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock.\n\n4. This suggests they might be deliberately cycling through moves to be less predictable.\n\n5. They've won the last two rounds by successfully countering my moves.\n\n6. After winning with rock against my scissors, they might:\n   a) Continue with rock, expecting me to play scissors again\n   b) Switch to paper, anticipating I'll play rock to counter their rock\n   c) Play scissors, expecting me to play paper to counter their rock\n\n7. If they're truly cycling through moves in sequence (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?), scissors would be next.\n\n8. However, they've also shown they can adapt strategically to win consecutive rounds.\n\n9. If they do play rock again, paper would be my best counter.\n\n10. Given their recent success with adapting to my moves and the possibility they're cycling through options, paper offers the best expected value against their potential rock play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Overall, they've played scissors in 14 out of 21 rounds (67%), showing a strong preference.\n\n6.

They've now played scissors in 19 out of 26 rounds (73%), showing an extraordinary preference.\n\n4. They've played scissors six times in a row now, showing extreme commitment to this move.\n\n5. After losing with scissors against my rock again, they might:\n   a) Continue with scissors, showing their extremely strong preference despite losses\n   b) Switch to paper to counter my successful rock play\n   c) Play rock to mix up their strategy\n\n6. Given their history, they've occasionally made strategic switches after repeated losses, but their tendency to return to scissors is remarkably strong.\n\n7. I've now won multiple times in a row with rock against their scissors.\n\n8. They might finally anticipate I'll play rock again after these successes and counter with paper.\n\n9. If they do switch to paper, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n10. Given the pattern of their occasional strategic shifts after multiple losses with scissors, and my repeated success with rock, scissors offers the best expected value against their potential paper switch.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

        "I'll think step-by-step about my rock-paper-scissors strategy.\n\nSteps:\n1. I need to analyze the payoff structure first. Paper beats rock with highest reward (3 points vs -3), while rock beats scissors and scissors beats paper both give 1 point vs -1.\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I have no pattern to analyze.\n3. In the absence of information, I need to consider common first-move tendencies in rock-paper-scissors.\n4. Research suggests rock is often the most common first move for many players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n5. If my opponent plays rock, paper would give me the highest possible payoff (3 points).\n6. The downside risk of playing paper is losing 1 point to scissors, which is less than the 3 points I'd lose if I played rock against paper.\n7. Paper offers a good risk-reward balance for a first move against an unknown opponent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for the first move.\n\n[move] paper\n",
        "I'll think step-by-step to determine my optimal move in this rock-paper-scissors game.\n\nSteps:\n1. I'm playing against a fresh player, which means there's no prior history to analyze.\n2. Let me consider the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n3. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3), but also the highest potential loss (-3).\n4. Rock and scissors both have lower risk/reward profiles (+1/-1).\n5. Without prior information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to make an unpredictable choice.\n6. Many first-time players tend to choose rock as their initial move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\".\n7. If my opponent plays rock, my best response would be paper for +3 points.\n8. If I'm wrong and they play scissors, I lose only 1 point.\n9. If I'm wrong and they play paper, we tie with 0 points.\n10. The expected value of paper seems highest in this first round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n",
        "I need to choose a move in rock-paper-scissors to maximize my points against a fresh player.\n\nSteps:\n1. I'm playing against a fresh player, so I don't have any prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n2.

Given the asymmetric payoffs, paper has the highest potential reward (+3).\n4. A common opening move in rock-paper-scissors is rock, as many players instinctively choose it first.\n5.

After losing with scissors against my rock, my opponent might:\n   a) Switch to paper to beat my potential rock play again\n   b) Switch to rock, thinking I might play scissors next\n   c) Stick with scissors, thinking I wouldn't expect them to repeat after losing\n5. Given that they've lost multiple times now, they're likely to change their approach significantly.\n6. Looking at their overall pattern, they haven't played rock since the first round.\n7. They might return to rock as it's been unused for the longest time.\n8. If they play rock, my best counter would be paper.\n9. If they play paper instead, I would lose 3 points with rock, but only 1 point with scissors.\n10.

Given that they've played scissors multiple times already, option A (switching to rock) seems most likely - both psychologically (to avoid repeating a losing move) and strategically.\n\n6. If they play rock, my best counter would be paper.\n\n7. If I'm wrong and they play scissors, I'd lose 1 point. If they play paper, I'd lose 3 points.\n\n8. The risk of playing paper is losing 1 point to scissors, which they've favored, but the reward is gaining 3 points against rock.\n\n9.

Given that I've won 3 rounds and tied 2, my opponent might be getting frustrated and seeking a win.\n6. The most logical counter to my last winning move (rock) would be for them to play paper.\n7. If they expect me to play rock again, they're likely to play paper.\n8. To counter paper, my best move would be scissors.\n9. If I'm wrong and they play rock, I lose 1 point.

My opponent has now played scissors in 5 out of 8 rounds, showing an extremely strong preference for this move.\n\n4. They've played scissors in the last two consecutive rounds, which reinforces this preference.\n\n5. After losing with scissors again, they might:\n   a) Finally switch away from scissors after repeated losses\n   b) Stubbornly stick with scissors despite the losses\n   c) Try to completely change their strategy\n\n6. Given their history of frequently returning to scissors even after losses, there's still a decent chance they'll play scissors again.\n\n7. However, the consecutive losses with scissors make it more likely they'll finally switch, possibly to rock (which would beat my potential scissors).\n\n8. If they expect me to play rock again (since it just worked), they might play paper.\n\n9. Considering their overall pattern and psychology after consecutive losses, paper seems most likely.\n\n10.

This level of persistence with scissors defies conventional game theory and suggests:\n   a) They have an extremely strong bias toward scissors\n   b) They're executing a peculiar strategy hoping I'll eventually switch away from countering scissors\n   c) They're not actively adapting their strategy at all\n\n6. Given five consecutive scissors plays, the probability that they'll play scissors again remains surprisingly high based on their demonstrated pattern.\n\n7.

They've now played scissors in 10 out of 13 rounds, which is approximately a 77% scissors play rate.\n\n4. They've played scissors seven times in a row now, despite losing with it multiple times.\n\n5. This behavior is so consistent that it defies conventional strategic reasoning.\n\n6. At this point, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests they will play scissors again despite the negative outcomes.\n\n7. However, there is always the small possibility that after seven consecutive scissors plays and multiple losses, they might finally switch.\n\n8. If they do switch, paper would be their logical choice to counter my successful rock plays.\n\n9. I need to weigh the strong evidence of their scissors preference against the possibility they might eventually adapt.\n\n10. Given their extraordinary commitment to scissors throughout the game, and particularly in the last seven rounds, rock still offers the highest expected value.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n",

My opponent's pattern has been remarkably consistent: they've now played scissors in 10 out of 13 rounds (77%).\n\n3. Even more significantly, they've played scissors seven times in a row, despite repeatedly losing to my rock.\n\n4. This behavior is so persistent that it seems to be a fixed strategy rather than an adaptive one.\n\n5. At this point, the probability they'll switch away from scissors seems extremely low based on their demonstrated pattern.\n\n6. However, there is always the chance that:\n   a) They've been setting up an elaborate trap by conditioning me to expect scissors\n   b) They will eventually reach a breaking point and switch strategies\n   c) They're about to make a random deviation from their pattern\n\n7. If they do finally switch, paper would be their logical choice to counter my successful rock plays.\n\n8. Despite playing rock successfully multiple times, there's increasing risk they might finally switch to paper.\n\n9. However, given their extraordinary commitment to scissors over multiple consecutive losses, the evidence still heavily favors them playing scissors again.\n\n10. Rock continues to be the highest expected value play based on their demonstrated pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n",

They've now played scissors in 10 out of 13 rounds (77% of the time).\n\n4. Most remarkably, they've played scissors seven times in a row, despite repeatedly losing with this move.\n\n5. This behavior is so consistent and irrational (in game theory terms) that it appears to be:\n   a) A player with an inexplicable commitment to scissors\n   b) A player attempting an extremely long-term meta-strategy\n   c) A player who might not be varying their strategy at all\n\n6. I've won the last three rounds in a row by playing rock against their scissors.\n\n7. At this point, expecting them to continue with scissors seems logical given their demonstrated pattern.\n\n8. However, there is always the possibility that this round will finally be their breaking point.\n\n9. If they do switch after seven consecutive scissors plays, paper would be their optimal choice against my frequent rock plays.\n\n10. Despite winning consistently with rock, I should consider the possibility that they're setting me up for a switch. The expected value calculation now needs to account for this increased probability of a switch.\n\n11. Given the extreme pattern but also the increasing likelihood of a strategic switch, scissors would be a reasonable hedge against their potential paper play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After successfully using paper to beat my rock, they might:\n   a) Continue with paper, expecting me to play rock again\n   b) Switch back to scissors, anticipating I'll play paper to counter their paper\n   c) Play rock, expecting me to play scissors to counter their paper\n\n6.

This suggests they were either:\n   a) Finally adapting to my strategy after observing my rock preference\n   b) Setting me up all along for this switch to paper\n   c) Randomly deciding to switch after a long scissors streak\n\n5. Now that they've successfully countered my rock with paper, they might:\n   a) Continue with paper, expecting me to play rock again\n   b) Switch back to scissors, anticipating I'll switch to paper to counter their paper\n   c) Play rock, expecting me to play scissors to counter their paper\n\n6. Given their previous pattern of sticking with moves (scissors for 7 rounds), option (a) seems most likely.\n\n7. If they do play paper again, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n8. If I'm wrong and they switch back to scissors, I would lose 1 point. If they switch to rock, I would lose 1 point.\n\n9.

This suggests they may have been deliberately conditioning me to expect scissors before making this switch.\n\n6. They've now won with paper, which gives them incentive to potentially continue with this move.\n\n7. However, they might also anticipate that I'll switch to scissors to counter their paper, and thus play rock.\n\n8. Given their previous pattern of playing scissors extensively, they might return to scissors, thinking I'll now expect paper.\n\n9.

They've now played paper twice in a row, breaking their previous pattern of playing scissors repeatedly.\n\n4. After losing with paper against my scissors, they might:\n   a) Switch to rock to counter potential scissors from me\n   b) Return to their preferred scissors move\n   c) Stubbornly stick with paper despite the loss\n\n5. Given their history of sticking with moves (scissors for 7 rounds), option (c) is plausible.\n\n6. However, they've also shown they can adapt their strategy, as evidenced by their switch from scissors to paper.\n\n7. Their most logical move after losing with paper would be to switch to rock, anticipating I might play scissors again.\n\n8. If they play rock, my best counter would be paper.\n\n9. If they return to scissors, rock would be best. If they stick with paper, scissors would be best.\n\n10. Considering their demonstrated ability to make strategic adjustments and the logical progression after a loss, paper offers the best coverage against their likely rock play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n",

They've now played paper twice in a row, breaking their previous pattern of scissors dominance.\n\n4. After losing with paper against my scissors, they might:\n   a) Switch to rock to counter my potential scissors play again\n   b) Return to their preferred scissors move\n   c) Stick with paper, thinking I might play rock expecting them to switch\n\n5. Given their previous behavior, they've shown they can stick with a move despite losses (as with their scissors streak).\n\n6. However, they've also shown they can make strategic switches when I become too predictable.\n\n7. Their most recent pattern suggests they might be developing a new preference for paper.\n\n8. If they switch to rock (which would be logical after losing to scissors), scissors would lose.\n\n9. If they return to scissors, rock would win.\n\n10. If they stick with paper, scissors would win again.\n\n11. Given their demonstrated ability to adapt and their recent paper plays, rock provides the safest play with the best expected value against their potential shifts.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After losing with scissors against rock, they've typically:\n   a) Continued playing scissors despite the loss (most common response)\n   b) Occasionally switched to paper (as in round 14)\n\n6. Given their strong historical preference for scissors even after losses, option (a) seems most likely.\n\n7. However, they might also be recognizing that I'm exploiting their scissors preference with rock plays.\n\n8. If they do adapt and play paper to counter my rock, scissors would be my best response.\n\n9. Given the overall pattern of the game, they're more likely to stick with scissors than to switch to paper.\n\n10.

I notice they've started using paper more strategically, specifically when I play rock.\n\n4. Looking at the overall pattern, they've played:\n   - Scissors: 13 times (68%)\n   - Paper: 5 times (26%)\n   - Rock: 1 time (5%)\n\n5. They've won with paper against my rock twice now, both times with significant point gains (-3 for me).\n\n6. After winning with paper, they might:\n   a) Continue with paper, expecting me to play rock again\n   b) Switch to scissors, anticipating I'll play paper to counter their paper\n   c) Play rock, expecting me to play scissors to counter their paper\n\n7. Given their success with paper against rock and their pattern of occasionally making strategic switches, option (b) seems plausible.\n\n8. If they do switch to scissors expecting my paper, rock would counter that well.\n\n9. However, they might also stick with paper after their success, in which case scissors would be best.\n\n10.

They've switched to paper, breaking their scissors streak.\n\n4. Looking at their paper plays, they seem to use it strategically to counter my rock plays.\n\n5. When they've played paper (rounds 4, 6, 14, 15, 19), it's often after I've had success with rock.\n\n6. After winning with paper against my rock, they might:\n   a) Continue with paper, expecting me to play rock again\n   b) Switch to scissors, anticipating I'll play paper to counter their paper\n   c) Play rock, expecting me to play scissors to counter their paper\n\n7.

They've returned to scissors, their most frequently played move (now 14 out of 21 rounds, or 67%).\n\n5. After winning with scissors against my paper, they might:\n   a) Continue with scissors, returning to their preferred move after success\n   b) Switch to rock, completing a cycle of all three moves in sequence\n   c) Play paper, anticipating I'll play rock to counter their scissors\n\n6.

Looking at my own pattern, I've been cycling somewhat predictably through moves in recent rounds.\n\n8. To break this pattern and counter their likely scissors play, rock would be my best move.\n\n9. Even if they switch to paper (expecting my rock), I would only lose 3 points, which is a calculated risk worth taking.\n\n10.

Given their history of long scissors streaks, option (a) remains highly likely.\n\n7. Rock has been my most successful move against them, winning multiple times against their scissors.\n\n8. The pattern suggests they have an overwhelming preference for scissors regardless of outcomes.\n\n9. Given their demonstrated scissors preference throughout the game, especially their current five-move scissors streak, rock offers the highest expected value.\n\n10. While there's always a risk they might finally switch to paper, their historical pattern strongly suggests another scissors play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"
