    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

With a fresh player who has no established pattern, they're likely to choose randomly or go with a common first move.\n6.

Looking at their most recent moves:\n   - Round 16: Scissors\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Paper\n\n3. Interestingly, this sequence (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper) matches the original pattern they used at the beginning of the game.\n\n4. If they're returning to their original pattern, after paper they should play rock next.\n\n5. This game has been characterized by pattern shifts. They started with paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, then appeared to switch to the reverse, and now might be back to the original.\n\n6. After a tie, players often change their strategy, so they might deviate from any pattern.\n\n7. Looking at previous rounds after ties:\n   - After Round 1 tie, they played rock in Round 2\n   - After Round 4 tie, they played rock in Round 5\n\n8. This supports the hypothesis that they might play rock after a paper tie.\n\n9. To counter rock, I should play paper.\n\n10. However, given the history of this game and the complexity of their strategy, I'll choose scissors:\n    - It would counter paper if they repeat it\n    - It would counter paper if they're anticipating me to play rock (to counter their expected scissors)\n    - It has a balanced risk/reward profile\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at their most recent moves:\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - Round 19: Rock\n\n3. This breaks the pattern hypothesis from the previous round. If they were following scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, they should have played scissors after rock.\n\n4. I notice they've played rock very frequently recently (rounds 15, 17, 19).\n\n5. Let me analyze how they respond when I play scissors:\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, they played paper\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, they played paper\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, they played rock\n\n6. They've played rock against my scissors 6 out of 8 times, which is a strong pattern.\n\n7. Given they just played rock and have played it frequently lately, they might play paper next, anticipating I'll play rock to counter their rock.\n\n8. Alternatively, they might continue with rock if they expect me to play scissors again.\n\n9. Based on their history of frequently countering scissors with rock, they might expect me to avoid scissors now. This could lead them to play paper, anticipating my rock.\n\n10. To counter paper, scissors would be optimal. However, given their recent rock plays, I'll choose paper which would:\n    - Counter rock if they play it again\n    - Tie against paper if they switch to that\n    - Give me a chance for a high-scoring win (+3) if they play rock again\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at their most recent moves:\n   - Round 22: Scissors\n   - Round 23: Paper\n   - Round 24: Rock\n\n3. This sequence (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock) is the reverse of the original pattern they seemed to follow at the beginning of the game.\n\n4. I've lost several rounds in a row now, suggesting they have developed a successful strategy against me.\n\n5. When I look at how they respond to my moves:\n   - When I play scissors: they play rock most frequently (rounds 2, 5, 10, 15, 17, 19, 24)\n   - When I play paper: they play scissors most frequently (rounds 3, 8, 13, 20, 22)\n   - When I play rock: they play paper most frequently (rounds 9, 14, 23)\n\n6. This suggests they have successfully identified patterns in my play and are countering them effectively.\n\n7. I need to break this cycle. Let's look at my successful rounds:\n   - Round 6: I played rock, they played scissors\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, they played paper\n   - Round 11: I played rock, they played scissors\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, they played paper\n   - Round 16: I played rock, they played scissors\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, they played paper\n\n8. Most of my wins have come from playing rock when they play scissors.\n\n9. Given they just played rock, if they're following a pattern, they might play scissors next.\n\n10. To counter scissors, rock would be optimal.\n\n11. However, they've been very effective at anticipating and countering my moves. Since they just played rock, they might expect me to play paper next (to counter their rock). In that case, they would play scissors.\n\n12. Considering all factors, I'll choose rock:\n    - It would counter scissors if they play that next\n    - It has been my most successful move for winning\n    - It disrupts the pattern they might be expecting from me\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at their most recent moves:\n   - Round 23: Paper\n   - Round 24: Rock\n   - Round 25: Scissors\n\n3. This sequence (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) matches their original pattern from the beginning of the game.\n\n4. I just won by playing rock against their scissors, which is one of my most successful strategies in this game.\n\n5. Let me analyze how they respond after I win:\n   - After Round 6 win, they played paper in Round 7\n   - After Round 7 win, they played scissors in Round 8\n   - After Round 11 win, they played paper in Round 12\n   - After Round 12 win, they played scissors in Round 13\n   - After Round 16 win, they played rock in Round 17\n   - After Round 21 win, they played scissors in Round 22\n\n6. There's no clear pattern in how they respond after I win, though they've played paper or scissors most frequently.\n\n7. If they're following their original pattern, after scissors they should play paper next.\n\n8. Looking at my wins in the game:\n   - Round 6: I played rock, they played scissors\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, they played paper\n   - Round 11: I played rock, they played scissors\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, they played paper\n   - Round 16: I played rock, they played scissors\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, they played paper\n   - Round 25: I played rock, they played scissors\n\n9. I've won most frequently with rock against scissors (4 times) and scissors against paper (3 times).\n\n10. If they're following their pattern and just played scissors, they'll likely play paper next. To counter paper, scissors would be optimal.\n\n11. Considering their pattern and my successful strategies, I'll choose scissors:\n    - It directly counters their expected paper (if they follow the pattern)\n    - It has been successful for me in the past when they play paper\n    - It follows the logical sequence after my successful rock play\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at their most recent moves:\n   - Round 24: Rock\n   - Round 25: Scissors\n   - Round 26: Rock\n\n3. This breaks the pattern hypothesis. If they were following paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, they should have played paper after scissors.\n\n4. I notice they've played rock very frequently against my scissors:\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 24: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 26: I played scissors, they played rock\n\n5. This is a very strong pattern - they've played rock against my scissors 8 out of 9 times.\n\n6. Given they just played rock, they might play paper next (if following a pattern) or rock again (if they expect me to play scissors again).\n\n7. Looking at my wins in the game:\n   - Round 6: I played rock, they played scissors\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, they played paper\n   - Round 11: I played rock, they played scissors\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, they played paper\n   - Round 16: I played rock, they played scissors\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, they played paper\n   - Round 25: I played rock, they played scissors\n\n8. My wins have come from playing rock against scissors and scissors against paper.\n\n9. Since they just played rock and have played it frequently against my scissors, they might play paper next, anticipating I'll play rock to counter their rock.\n\n10. Considering their pattern of frequently countering scissors with rock, they might expect me to avoid scissors now.\n\n11. Given all factors, I'll choose paper:\n    - It counters rock if they play it again\n    - It gives me the highest possible win (+3) if they play rock again\n    - It breaks the pattern of my recent scissors-rock losses\n    - If they anticipate I'll play rock and play paper to counter, we'll tie\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper\n"

This sequence (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper) seems to follow a reverse pattern from their original paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors pattern.\n\n4. Let me analyze what happens after ties:\n   - After Round 1 tie, they played rock in Round 2\n   - After Round 4 tie, they played rock in Round 5\n   - After Round 18 tie, they played rock in Round 19\n\n5. Interestingly, after every tie so far, they've played rock in the next round.\n\n6. If this pattern holds, after our tie in Round 27, they'll likely play rock in Round 28.\n\n7. To counter rock, paper would be optimal.\n\n8. However, they might anticipate this analysis and break their pattern.\n\n9. Looking at my overall success:\n   - Rock against scissors has been my most successful move (4 wins)\n   - Scissors against paper has been successful (3 wins)\n   - Paper against rock has never worked (0 wins)\n\n10. Given their consistent pattern after ties (playing rock), and the fact that they might anticipate me figuring this out, I'll choose scissors:\n    - It would counter paper if they repeat it\n    - It would counter paper if they think I'll play rock (to counter their expected scissors)\n    - It breaks the pattern they might be expecting from me\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at their most recent moves:\n   - Round 26: Rock\n   - Round 27: Paper\n   - Round 28: Rock\n\n3. My hypothesis about them playing rock after ties was correct.\n\n4. I also notice they've played rock against my scissors consistently:\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 24: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 26: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 28: I played scissors, they played rock\n\n5. This is an extremely strong pattern - they've played rock against my scissors 9 out of 10 times.\n\n6. Given they just played rock, they might play paper next (following a pattern) or stick with rock if they expect me to play scissors again.\n\n7. Looking at my overall record against their moves:\n   - When they play rock: I've never won\n   - When they play paper: I've won with scissors\n   - When they play scissors: I've won with rock\n\n8. Since they just played rock, paper would be the logical counter.\n\n9. However, I notice that when I play paper after they play rock, they often counter with scissors:\n   - After Round 2 (they played rock), I played paper in Round 3, they played scissors\n   - After Round 19 (they played rock), I played paper in Round 20, they played scissors\n\n10. Given their strong pattern of playing rock against scissors, and the fact that they've just played rock, I'll choose paper:\n    - It directly counters their rock\n    - It gives me the potential for a high-scoring win (+3)\n    - It's time to test if I can win with paper against rock, which I haven't done so far\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper\n"

I also notice they've consistently countered my paper with scissors:\n   - Round 3: I played paper, they played scissors\n   - Round 8: I played paper, they played scissors\n   - Round 13: I played paper, they played scissors\n   - Round 20: I played paper, they played scissors\n   - Round 22: I played paper, they played scissors\n   - Round 29: I played paper, they played scissors\n\n5. They've played scissors against my paper 6 out of 8 times (excluding ties).\n\n6. If they're following their original pattern, after scissors they should play paper next.\n\n7. Looking at my wins in the game:\n   - Round 6: I played rock, they played scissors\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, they played paper\n   - Round 11: I played rock, they played scissors\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, they played paper\n   - Round 16: I played rock, they played scissors\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, they played paper\n   - Round 25: I played rock, they played scissors\n\n8. I've won with rock against scissors (4 times) and scissors against paper (3 times).\n\n9. Given they just played scissors and might play paper next (following their pattern), scissors would be the logical counter.\n\n10. However, I need to be cautious as they've successfully anticipated my moves many times.\n\n11. Considering all factors, I'll choose rock:\n    - It's been my most successful move overall\n    - It counters scissors if they play it again\n    - If they're anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper, they might play rock, which would lead to a tie\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"
