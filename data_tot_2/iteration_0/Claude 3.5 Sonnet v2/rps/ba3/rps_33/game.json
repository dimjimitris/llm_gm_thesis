Looking at the risks:\n   - Choosing rock risks losing 3 points to paper\n   - Choosing paper risks losing 1 point to scissors\n   - Choosing scissors risks losing 1 point to rock\n\n4. Strategic consideration:\n   - Paper has highest reward potential (3 points)\n   - But paper also has safer risk (-1 vs -3)\n   - Many players tend to choose rock as first move as it feels \"strong\"\n\n5. Based on this analysis:\n   - Paper is the optimal first move\n   - It can win big (3 points) against expected rock\n   - If we lose, we only lose 1 point to scissors\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper\n\n[move] paper (Choosing paper as it offers highest reward potential while having manageable risk)\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Breaking the cycle:\n   - Following the circle: rock -> paper would be natural\n   - But opponent likely expects this\n   - Triple tie might make opponent extra cautious\n   - They might expect me to be cautious too\n\n5.
