    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Behavioral Analyst - For understanding opponent patterns and psychology\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when beating rock, while having a relatively low penalty (-1) when losing to scissors. Rock and scissors both have lower reward (1 point) and varying penalties.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Since this is a fresh opponent with no history, we don't have any pattern to analyze. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nRisk Manager: Given that paper has the highest potential reward (3) and lowest potential penalty (-1), it presents the best risk-reward ratio among all moves. Even if we lose, we only lose 1 point, but winning gives us 3 points.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The expected value for paper is higher given the payoff structure, especially if we assume a roughly equal probability of opponent moves in this first round.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on this analysis, I'll choose paper for this first move. It offers the best risk-reward ratio and could capitalize on the common tendency of players to choose rock first.\n\n[move] paper\n\nRisk Manager: Good choice.

A strategic player who anticipated our paper play\n2. A player who likes to be aggressive/unpredictable\n3. Or simply random choice\n\nGame Strategist: Given this outcome, let's consider our options:\n1. Rock would be strong against their previous scissors play\n2. However, if they're strategic, they might anticipate us switching to rock and counter with paper\n3. If they're playing randomly, all moves are equally likely\n\nRisk Manager: From the first round:\n- They showed willingness to use scissors\n- We lost only 1 point, which is manageable\n- We need to balance between responding to their previous move and avoiding being too predictable\n\nGame Strategist: Many players tend to stick with a winning move. If they're a basic strategy player, they might use scissors again. However, if they're more sophisticated, they might expect us to play rock and counter with paper.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this uncertainty, rock offers a good balance:\n- Beats scissors (their previous move) for +1\n- If they switch to paper, we lose 3 points\n- If they use scissors again, we win 1 point\n- Against rock, we tie (0 points)\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with playing rock.

They didn't adapt after winning the first round\n3. This could indicate either:\n   - A strong preference for scissors\n   - A simple strategy player\n   - Or they might now realize they're becoming predictable\n\nGame Strategist: We have a clear pattern: the opponent has played scissors in both rounds.\n- Round 1: They won against our paper\n- Round 2: They lost against our rock\nTheir consistent scissors play cost them in the second round, but they might be more likely to change now after losing.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's assess our options:\n1. Rock again:\n   - Safe against scissors (their pattern so far)\n   - But very vulnerable if they switch to paper (-3)\n   - Might be too predictable after our win\n2. Paper:\n   - Good if they switch to rock\n   - Risky if they continue scissors\n3. Scissors:\n   - Safe if they switch to paper\n   - Ties if they continue scissors\n   - Loses to rock\n\nBehavioral Analyst: After losing, players often change their strategy. Given they've used scissors twice and just lost, they're highly likely to switch. Many players would switch to rock after losing with scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper for this round. Here's why:\n1. It counters the most likely psychological play (rock) after their loss\n2. Even if we're wrong, we only lose 1 point to scissors\n3. It shows we're also willing to change our strategy\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the Game Strategist.

Round 3: Paper (tie)\nThey finally broke their scissors pattern and switched to paper, just as we predicted. This suggests:\n- They are capable of adapting\n- They might be starting to think more strategically\n- They could be trying to read our patterns now\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at their progression:\n- They showed they can stick to a strategy (scissors twice)\n- Then demonstrated willingness to change (to paper)\n- The tie result gives us a neutral game state\nA key question is: will they try to predict our next move based on our previous patterns?\n\nRisk Manager: Let's evaluate our position:\n- Current total score: -1 + 1 + 0 = 0 points\n- We've shown paper (twice) and rock (once)\n- Each time we've made logical moves based on previous rounds\n\nBehavioral Analyst: After a tie, players often:\n1. Either stick with the same move hoping to predict their opponent's change\n2. Or switch to the move that beats what was just played\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've now seen us play paper twice, they might expect us to continue that pattern. Scissors would be their logical counter to that expectation. Therefore, I recommend rock for this round:\n- Beats scissors if they try to counter our paper pattern\n- Only loses 3 points to paper if they stick with it\n- Shows we're not predictable\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with rock. While it has the highest potential loss (-3 to paper), it protects against the most likely psychological play (scissors) and would give us momentum if successful.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis is sound.

This suggests:\n- They might have a strong preference for scissors\n- They're not adapting well to losses\n- Or they might be using a more complex alternating pattern\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze our successful moves:\n- We've won twice with rock against scissors\n- Our paper plays resulted in one loss and one tie\n- We're currently up by 1 point total (-1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 1)\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has used scissors in 3 out of 4 rounds. However, there are two risks to consider:\n1. The \"surely they won't use scissors again\" trap\n2. The possibility they're setting up a pattern to break dramatically\n\nBehavioral Analyst: After losing twice with the same move (scissors), basic psychology suggests they should definitely change. However, they've already shown they can return to scissors even after losing with it. This makes their next move particularly unpredictable.\n\nGame Strategist: We have three options:\n1. Rock again: Has worked well but might be too predictable\n2. Paper: High reward if they switch to rock, but risky\n3. Scissors: Safe against paper, wins mirror match\n\nRisk Manager: Given their strong scissors preference, playing rock again might seem obvious. However, this could be exactly what they're waiting for to switch to paper. I suggest scissors as a balanced move:\n- Ties against their preferred scissors\n- Wins against paper if they try to counter our rock\n- Only loses 1 point to rock if we're wrong\n\nAI Assistant: I agree. Let's break our own rock pattern and play scissors. It protects against both their most common move (scissors) and their possible paper play, while only risking a 1-point loss.\n\n[move] scissors\n\nFinish collaboration!\n"

Either continue avoiding it due to discomfort\n2. Or suddenly use it when they feel their current strategy isn't working\nGiven their losing streak, this might be the moment they finally try rock.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper for this round because:\n1.

Continue the rotation out of mental fatigue (suggesting scissors next)\n2. Finally break the pattern after realizing we've figured it out\n\nBehavioral Analyst: After such a devastating series of losses, especially two -3 point losses:\n1. They might be too tilted to think strategically\n2. They might finally realize we're predicting them\n3. They might abandon their rotation completely\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend rock:\n1. Beats scissors if they continue their rotation\n2. Ties against rock if they repeat their last move\n3. Only loses to paper (-3), but they're unlikely to use paper after seeing us repeatedly counter their pattern\n\nAI Assistant: Given the overwhelming frustration they must be feeling and the high probability they'll either continue their rotation (scissors) or break down completely (possibly returning to their comfort move of scissors), I agree that rock is our best play.\n\n[move] rock\n\nFinish collaboration!\n"

Continue their pattern due to mental fatigue and resignation\n2. Finally snap and make a completely random choice\n3. Try to double-guess what we'll expect them to do\n\nGame Strategist: Given their consistent adherence to the pattern even under extreme losses, I believe they're too tilted to think strategically anymore. They're likely to:\n1. Either continue with paper (following rotation)\n2. Or revert to scissors (their only successful move from round 1)\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend scissors:\n1. Beats paper if they continue their rotation\n2. Ties against scissors if they revert to their comfort move\n3. Only loses 1 point to rock, which they've used least often\n4. We're far enough ahead to take this calculated risk\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis is clear. Given their apparent inability to break from their pattern despite devastating losses, plus the psychological factors at play, scissors offers our best move. It covers both their most likely plays (paper from rotation, or scissors from tilt) while minimizing potential losses.\n\n[move] scissors\n\nFinish collaboration!\n"
