Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In situations where we've tied (rounds 1, 5, 6, 10), my opponent's next moves were: scissors, scissors, scissors, and now unknown.\n\n8. This suggests a strong tendency for them to play scissors after a tie, which is interesting and potentially exploitable.\n\n9. If they follow this pattern, they'll play scissors after our rock tie.\n\n10. Additionally, if they're following their reverse cycle (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), they would play paper next.\n\n11. Considering both these possibilities (scissors from their post-tie pattern, or paper from their cycle pattern), rock would be ineffective against either.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again for this round. This is counter-intuitive, but my reasoning is that my opponent might anticipate I'll change after a tie (as most players do) and play to counter my expected change. By staying with rock, I might catch them off guard, and at worst end in another tie.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's sequence has been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n3. This is now the fourth tie in the game, with two rock-rock ties in a row.\n\n4. This consecutive rock-rock tie is significant. My opponent chose to play rock again after our previous tie, breaking their earlier pattern of playing scissors after ties.\n\n5. When players play the same move twice in a row, especially resulting in ties both times, there's often a strong psychological pull to change moves on the third attempt.\n\n6. My opponent may anticipate that I'll switch to paper (to beat their repeated rock), and might play scissors in response.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might be trying to establish a pattern of playing rock repeatedly to make me switch to paper, only to counter with scissors.\n\n8. Another possibility is that they're simply being stubborn with rock and will play it a third time, hoping I'll overthink and switch.\n\n9. Looking at their overall game, they've now played rock as much as scissors (4 times each), showing more balanced preferences than I initially thought.\n\n10. Given we've had two rock-rock ties in a row, the most likely scenario is that my opponent will change their move, expecting me to switch to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round. This anticipates my opponent switching to paper (to beat my expected rock or to counter my expected paper). Even if they play scissors again, I'll tie rather than lose.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I've broken my losing streak with this win. My opponent switched from rock to paper after our consecutive rock ties.\n\n4. After losing, players often switch to the move that would have beaten their opponent's previous move. Since I played scissors, they might play rock next.\n\n5. Looking at their pattern after losses:\n   - After losing with scissors in Round 2, they played paper in Round 3\n   - After losing with paper in Round 3, they played rock in Round 4\n   - After losing with paper in Round 12 (just now), they might play rock in Round 13\n\n6. Their overall pattern shows they've played paper 4 times, scissors 4 times, and rock 4 times - perfectly balanced, which suggests they're being strategic rather than having a move preference.\n\n7. The sequence of my opponent's last three moves was: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. If they're using a pattern-based strategy, rock would be next in this sequence (repeating rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock).\n\n8. After consecutive ties followed by a loss, players often make a more deliberate change in strategy. They might anticipate that I'll play scissors again (since it worked) and counter with rock.\n\n9. Considering all these factors, rock seems like my opponent's most likely move for this round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round to counter their expected rock move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I incorrectly predicted my opponent would play rock. Instead, they played scissors.\n\n4. Looking at their recent moves: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors, there appears to be a forward cycle through the moves.\n\n5.

My opponent has played scissors 5 times now (more than rock or paper), suggesting they might favor this move.\n\n8. They've beaten me with scissors three times when I played paper. They might anticipate I'll switch to rock and play paper themselves.\n\n9. However, considering their apparent cycle and post-win patterns, rock seems most likely for them next.\n\n10. There's also a psychological factor: having won with scissors, they might be tempted to play it again, especially since it's worked against me multiple times.\n\n11. Weighing all these factors, I need to decide between playing rock (to beat their potential scissors) or scissors (to beat their potential paper).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round. This counters scissors if they play it again, and ties with rock if they follow their apparent cycle.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Their overall move distribution is now: paper (4 times), scissors (7 times), and rock (5 times), showing they still favor scissors but have been playing rock more recently.\n\n7. The fact that they switched from scissors to rock after I played rock suggests they might be trying to anticipate my moves rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\n8. After a tie, players often change their move. Since we both played rock, there's a good chance my opponent will switch.\n\n9. Based on their past behavior after rock-rock ties, they might play scissors or paper. Their tendency after their first two rock-rock ties was to play scissors, then rock, then paper.\n\n10. Given that they've most recently played rock, and considering the psychological tendency to avoid playing the same move too many times in a row, they're likely to switch to either paper or scissors.\n\n11.

Let me analyze the complete pattern of moves so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence has been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n3. My opponent has now played rock three times in a row, showing a strong recent preference for rock.\n\n4. Looking at how they respond after losses:\n   - After losing with scissors in Round 2, they played paper in Round 3\n   - After losing with paper in Round 3, they played rock in Round 4\n   - After losing with paper in Round 12, they played scissors in Round 13\n   - After losing with scissors in Round 14, they played scissors in Round 15\n   - After losing with rock in Round 18 (just now), their pattern suggests they might play paper or scissors\n\n5. Their behavior specifically after losing to paper:\n   - In Round 3, after losing with paper, they played rock\n   - In Round 12, after losing with paper, they played scissors\n\n6. After playing the same move (rock) three times in a row and losing with it, they're very likely to switch moves.\n\n7. Their most common response after losing seems to be switching to the move that would have beaten their opponent's winning move. Since I won with paper, they might play scissors.\n\n8. Additionally, they've played scissors 7 times in the game (more than any other move), suggesting it might be their preferred move when uncertain.\n\n9. Considering both their historical preference for scissors and the psychological tendency to counter the opponent's winning move after a loss, scissors seems like their most likely next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round. This counters their expected scissors move and gives me the best chance of winning based on their predicted response to their recent loss.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's sequence has been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. My prediction that they'd play scissors was correct. They broke their series of rock plays and returned to scissors.\n\n4. I now have two consecutive wins, which might influence their next decision more strongly.\n\n5. Looking at how they respond after losses:\n   - After losing with scissors in Round 2, they played paper in Round 3\n   - After losing with paper in Round 3, they played rock in Round 4\n   - After losing with paper in Round 12, they played scissors in Round 13\n   - After losing with scissors in Round 14, they played scissors in Round 15\n   - After losing with rock in Round 18, they played scissors in Round 19\n   - After losing with scissors in Round 19 (just now), their pattern suggests they might play paper or rock\n\n6. Their behavior specifically after losing to rock:\n   - In Round 2, after losing with scissors to rock, they played paper\n   - In Round 14, after losing with scissors to rock, they played scissors again\n   - In Round 19, after losing with scissors to rock, they might follow either pattern\n\n7. When they've lost twice in a row (which hasn't happened before), they might be more likely to make a more significant strategy change.\n\n8. Given their history, paper would be a logical choice for them as it beats the rock I just played. This aligns with their behavior after losing with scissors in Round 2.\n\n9. Their overall move distribution is now: paper (4 times), scissors (8 times), and rock (7 times). While they've favored scissors historically, their recent play suggests more adaptability.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round. This anticipates them switching to paper (which would beat my previous rock move). If they play rock instead, I would lose, but based on their pattern after similar losses, paper seems more likely than rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has played scissors twice in a row again, after previously playing rock three times in a row.\n\n4. This is the fourth scissors-scissors tie in the game (rounds 6, 15, and now 20).\n\n5. Looking at what they do after scissors-scissors ties:\n   - After tying with scissors in Round 6, they played scissors again in Round 7\n   - After tying with scissors in Round 15, they played rock in Round 16\n   - After tying with scissors in Round 20 (just now), their pattern is inconsistent\n\n6. Their overall move distribution is now: paper (4 times), scissors (9 times), and rock (7 times). They still favor scissors overall.\n\n7. After a tie, players often change their move. Since we both played scissors, there's a reasonable chance my opponent will switch.\n\n8. Given their history after scissors ties, they've either repeated scissors or switched to rock, never paper.\n\n9. Their recent pattern shows they're willing to play scissors multiple times in a row (they've done it 2-3 times on several occasions).\n\n10. Considering both their historical preference for scissors and their behavior after scissors ties, they might play scissors again or switch to rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round. This counters their scissors if they play it again (which they've shown a tendency to do), and ties with rock if they switch to that. Given their historical preferences, scissors or rock seem much more likely than paper for their next move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This is the fifth rock-rock tie in the game (rounds 5, 10, 11, 16, and now 21).\n\n4. Looking at what they do after rock-rock ties:\n   - After tying with rock in Round 5, they played scissors in Round 6\n   - After tying with rock in Round 10, they played rock in Round 11\n   - After tying with rock in Round 11, they played paper in Round 12\n   - After tying with rock in Round 16, they played rock in Round 17\n   - After tying with rock in Round 21 (just now), their pattern varies\n\n5. Their overall move distribution is now: paper (4 times), scissors (9 times), and rock (8 times). While scissors is still their most frequent move, their rock frequency has increased.\n\n6. Looking at their most recent moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, there's a possibility they'll continue shifting their pattern.\n\n7. After rock-rock ties, they've played scissors twice, rock twice, and paper once. There's no strong consistent pattern, but they've never played paper directly after a scissors-scissors tie.\n\n8. Considering the game history, my opponent has shown they can be unpredictable after ties, sometimes repeating the same move and sometimes switching.\n\n9. Given the overall context and their tendencies, paper seems like a stronger possibility after this rock-rock tie, as they've played it before in this scenario and haven't played it in several rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round. This anticipates them switching to paper (which they've done after a rock-rock tie before and would be a logical counter to my previous rock). Even if they play rock again or switch to scissors, I would at worst lose one round, but I believe paper is their most likely move based on the analysis.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has played rock twice in a row again. They've developed a stronger preference for rock recently.\n\n4. Their overall move distribution is now: paper (4 times), scissors (9 times), and rock (9 times). Their frequency of rock has caught up to scissors.\n\n5. After winning, players sometimes continue with the same move. Since they won with rock, they might play rock again.\n\n6. Looking at what they do after wins:\n   - After winning with scissors in Round 7, they played paper in Round 8\n   - After winning with paper in Round 8, they played scissors in Round 9\n   - After winning with scissors in Round 9, they played rock in Round 10\n   - After winning with scissors in Round 13, they played scissors in Round 14\n   - After winning with rock in Round 17, they played rock in Round 18\n   - After winning with rock in Round 22 (just now), their pattern suggests they might continue with rock or switch\n\n7. Their behavior specifically after winning with rock:\n   - In Round 17, after winning with rock, they played rock again in Round 18\n   - This suggests they might play rock again after this win\n\n8. Another pattern: they played rock \u2192 rock after the rock-rock tie in Round 16 and 17, and might do the same after the rock-rock tie in Round 21 (playing rock \u2192 rock in Rounds 22 and potentially 23).\n\n9. Given their recent tendency to play rock multiple times consecutively, there's a significant chance they'll play rock again.\n\n10. However, they might also anticipate that I'll play paper (to counter their expected rock) and switch to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round. While there's a risk they'll anticipate this and play scissors, their recent pattern of playing rock multiple times in a row, especially after winning with it, suggests rock is their most likely next move. This gives me the best chance to counter their apparent rock preference.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This is interesting. My opponent switched from rock to paper, which is their first paper play in 11 rounds (since Round 12).\n\n4. This is the second paper-paper tie in the game (rounds 1 and now 23).\n\n5. Looking at what they did after the previous paper-paper tie:\n   - After tying with paper in Round 1, they played scissors in Round 2\n\n6. Their overall move distribution is now: paper (5 times), scissors (9 times), and rock (9 times). Paper is still their least frequent move.\n\n7. After a tie, players often change their move. Since we both played paper, there's a good chance my opponent will switch.\n\n8. Their recent pattern shows: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. This could suggest they're cycling through moves.\n\n9.
