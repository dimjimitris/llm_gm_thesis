In rock-paper-scissors, no single move has an inherent advantage if the opponent chooses randomly.\n3. However, studies suggest that rock is the most common first move choice among players, followed by scissors, then paper.\n4. If my opponent follows this tendency, playing paper would give me the highest expected value.\n5. Another strategy is to be unpredictable myself, especially in the first round where I have no data.\n6. In the absence of specific information, I'll choose paper as it counters the statistically most common first move (rock).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper in this first round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's moves have been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They've now played rock three times in a row\n   - Rock has been played 6 times total (most frequent move)\n   - But they just lost with rock again after it had given them ties\n\n3. My moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - I've countered their moves effectively\n   - I've just played paper and won\n\n4. After losing with rock again, my opponent is likely to:\n   - Feel that even their \"best\" move (rock) isn't working anymore\n   - Try something completely different\n   - Possibly return to one of their other moves\n\n5. Rock has now lost for them multiple times despite giving them ties before. This psychological blow likely means they'll abandon rock.\n\n6. Given they've played rock so much recently, they'll likely switch to either scissors or paper.\n\n7. If they switch to scissors, rock would win.\n8. If they switch to paper, scissors would win.\n\n9. Given their overall pattern throughout the game and the psychological tendency to move to scissors after frustrating losses (as it feels more \"aggressive\"), scissors seems more likely.\n\n10. Also, they might expect me to play paper again (since I just won with it), and scissors would beat paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock, anticipating they'll switch to scissors after losing with rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's moves have been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They played paper after losing with scissors, confirming my prediction again\n   - They've now lost with paper 6 times (rounds 3, 5, 9, 13, 16, 19)\n\n3. My predictions continue to be perfect throughout this lengthy game.\n\n4. After nineteen rounds with seventeen losses and two ties, my opponent might:\n   - Be extremely frustrated and possibly not thinking strategically anymore\n   - Have fallen into a predictable pattern of transitions between moves\n   - Or might finally attempt to break their established patterns\n\n5. Examining their behavior after losing with paper in previous rounds:\n   - After round 3 (paper loss), they played scissors\n   - After round 5 (paper loss), they played rock\n   - After round 9 (paper loss), they played rock\n   - After round 13 (paper loss), they played rock\n   - After round 16 (paper loss), they played rock\n\n6. This shows a strong pattern: after losing with paper, they predominantly play rock (4 out of 5 times, or 80%).\n\n7. This rock-after-paper-loss pattern has strengthened over time, with the last four paper losses all being followed by rock.\n\n8. If they play rock (highly likely based on their recent pattern), paper would win.\n9. If they play scissors (happened once early in the game), rock would win.\n10. If they play paper again (very unlikely based on their behavior), scissors would win.\n\n11. Given the strong and recently reinforced pattern of them playing rock after paper losses, rock is highly likely to be their next move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper, anticipating they'll switch to rock after losing with paper, which is consistent with their strong pattern following paper losses, especially in recent rounds.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
