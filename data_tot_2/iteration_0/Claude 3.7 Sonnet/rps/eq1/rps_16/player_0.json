    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

But:\n   - My opponent might expect this and play rock to counter\n   - But given they've never played rock in 10 rounds, this seems unlikely\n   - They might return to their paper preference, expecting me to break my pattern\n\n7. I should break my pattern to be less predictable, but still consider my opponent's tendencies:\n   - My opponent heavily favors paper (7/10 moves)\n   - Even after winning with paper, they're likely to play paper again based on past behavior\n   - Scissors would be the logical counter to their paper preference\n\n[move] scissors (Breaking my pattern after losing, but anticipating my opponent's preference for paper)\n"

My overall record is now 11 wins, 4 ties, and 3 losses.\n\n4. Key insights:\n   - My opponent has maintained their rock strategy despite losing with it\n   - This mirrors their earlier behavior with paper (sticking with it despite losses)\n   - They seem to commit to a strategy for extended periods regardless of outcomes\n   - They've now lost twice with rock against my paper but still continued with rock\n\n5. Given their demonstrated patterns:\n   - They have shown a strong tendency to stick with the same move for many rounds\n   - They might eventually switch strategies, but only after multiple rounds with the same move\n   - Their most likely move is to continue with rock again\n   - If they do change, they might go back to paper (their original preferred move) or try scissors\n\n6. The probability that they'll play rock again seems high based on their past behavior.\n   - If they play rock again, paper would win\n   - If they switch to scissors, rock would win\n   - If they switch to paper, scissors would win\n\n7. Given their strong tendency to stick with a move despite losing with it, paper remains the best choice.\n\n[move] paper (Expecting my opponent to continue with rock despite losing twice with it)\n"

Key insights:\n   - My opponent has maintained their rock strategy despite losing three times in a row with it\n   - This reinforces their pattern of sticking with a move for many consecutive rounds\n   - They first played paper for many rounds (with occasional scissors), now they're doing the same with rock\n   - Their strategy appears to be to maintain the same move for extended periods regardless of outcomes\n\n5. Given their extremely consistent pattern:\n   - They are very likely to play rock again despite the losses\n   - They eventually switched from paper to rock after 14 rounds, so they might switch again at some point\n   - But based on their pattern, that switch probably won't happen immediately\n\n6. After losing three times in a row with rock, a typical player would switch moves, but this opponent has shown they don't follow typical patterns.\n   - If they play rock again, paper would win\n   - If they finally switch to scissors, rock would win\n   - If they switch back to paper, scissors would win\n\n7.

Given their established pattern:\n   - They are highly likely to continue playing rock despite the repeated losses\n   - Even if they do eventually switch, it likely won't happen immediately based on past behavior\n   - If a switch does occur, it might be to paper (their previously favored move) or scissors\n\n6. The safest move continues to be paper:\n   - If they play rock again (most likely), paper wins\n   - If they finally switch to scissors, I would lose\n   - If they switch back to paper, we would tie\n\n7. The risk of them switching to scissors exists, but their demonstrated pattern suggests they're more likely to stick with rock for at least another round.\n\n[move] paper (Continuing to counter my opponent's remarkably persistent rock strategy)\n"

After this change, the opponent might:\n   - Continue with scissors since it just won\n   - Return to rock or paper (their previously used moves)\n   - Their pattern suggests they might stick with scissors for multiple rounds now\n\n6.
