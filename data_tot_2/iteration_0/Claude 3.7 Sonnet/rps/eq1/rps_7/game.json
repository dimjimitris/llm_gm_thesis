However, given their perfect predictability throughout our extensive match, playing paper remains my optimal strategic choice based on the overwhelming evidence. This continues my extremely effective strategy of countering their anticipated move with complete confidence, which has resulted in a perfect 22-0 record.\n",
        "Incredible! My rock beat their scissors again in the twenty-second round.\n\n[move] Paper\n\nFor this twenty-third round, I'll play paper.

Since I just played rock, their established pattern guarantees they will play paper next (which would beat my previous rock).\n\nBy playing paper now, we would tie if they maintain their unwavering pattern. After twenty-two consecutive losses, it is absolutely certain they are following a fixed algorithm with no learning or adaptation capability whatsoever. If they somehow break their pattern after this unprecedented consistency and play scissors, I would lose.
