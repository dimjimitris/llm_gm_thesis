Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I need a strategic opening move.\n\n4.

Looking at their last few moves:\n   - rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   This follows the classic rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n\n4. If they continue this pattern, they would play rock next.\n\n5. However, I've also noticed they frequently play scissors (5 times in 10 rounds), which is their most common move.\n\n6. They might also recognize that I correctly predicted their scissors last time and expect me to play rock again, in which case they might play paper.\n\n7. The payoff matrix reminds me:\n   - If they play rock and I play paper, I win 3 points\n   - If they play paper and I play scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If they play scissors and I play rock, I win 1 point\n\n8. Given their pattern suggests rock next, and the highest reward comes from countering rock with paper, paper seems like the optimal choice.\n\n9. This is especially true considering that if they break pattern and play paper instead (to counter my anticipated rock), I would only lose 1 point with paper, versus losing 3 points if I played rock against their paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, anticipating they might play rock next following their observed cycle. This offers the highest potential reward (3 points) while limiting potential loss.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Their last three moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   This broke their previous pattern of the standard progression.\n\n5. Looking at when they've played paper (rounds 1, 4, 9, 11), they've followed with:\n   - paper \u2192 rock (rounds 1-2)\n   - paper \u2192 scissors (rounds 4-5)\n   - paper \u2192 scissors (rounds 9-10)\n   - paper \u2192 ? (current situation)\n\n6. Based on the above, they've followed paper with scissors twice and rock once. Scissors seems more likely.\n\n7. Additionally, after our tied paper moves in round 9, they played scissors in round 10.\n\n8. Given the high frequency of scissors in their play history (5 times) and that they've followed paper with scissors more often than not, scissors seems like their most probable next move.\n\n9. My best counter to scissors would be rock, which would give me a 1 point win.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter their anticipated scissors move, which they've frequently played after paper in previous rounds.\n\n[move] rock\n"

However, given our high rate of matching moves, I need to consider what they think I might play:\n   - They might expect me to predict scissors and play rock\n   - They might expect me to overthink and play paper to counter their anticipated rock\n   - They might expect me to be even more complex and play scissors\n\n7.

My opponent's complete sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n3. They've now played scissors 8 times out of 18 rounds, which remains their most frequent move.\n\n4. Their sequence for the last three rounds: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   This follows the classic rock-paper-scissors cycle, which they've shown before.\n\n5. If they continue this cycle, they would play rock next.\n\n6. However, they've also repeatedly returned to scissors after deviating from patterns.\n\n7. Let me analyze what they've played after scissors:\n   - After scissors in round 3, they played paper in round 4\n   - After scissors in round 5, they played rock in round 6\n   - After scissors in round 7, they played rock in round 8\n   - After scissors in round 10, they played paper in round 11\n   - After scissors in round 13, they played scissors in round 14\n   - After scissors in round 14, they played paper in round 15\n   - After scissors in round 18, they might play...?\n\n8. After playing scissors, they've played paper 3 times, rock 2 times, and scissors once. Paper is slightly more likely.\n\n9. Given their cyclic pattern in the last three rounds and their history after scissors, paper seems like a reasonable prediction for their next move.\n\n10. If they play paper and I play scissors, I win 1 point.\n\n11. If I'm wrong and they play rock instead, I would lose 1 point with scissors - a manageable risk.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their anticipated paper move, which follows their recent cycle and is their most common follow-up to scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Their last three moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   They've returned to paper, which they've played 7 times now (compared to 8 times for scissors).\n\n4. Looking at what they've played after paper:\n   - After paper in round 1, they played rock in round 2\n   - After paper in round 4, they played scissors in round 5\n   - After paper in round 9, they played scissors in round 10\n   - After paper in round 11, they played rock in round 12\n   - After paper in round 15, they played rock in round 16\n   - After paper in round 17, they played scissors in round 18\n   - After paper in round 19, they might play...?\n\n5. After playing paper, they've played scissors 3 times and rock 3 times - exactly equal.\n\n6. However, their most recent pattern after paper has been rock (rounds 15-16) and scissors (rounds 17-18). If they alternate, they would play rock next.\n\n7. Additionally, their last five moves show a potential pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 ?\n   If they continue with a rock-paper-scissors cycle, they would play rock next.\n\n8.

Their last three moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   They've returned to scissors after paper.\n\n5. Looking at times I've played paper throughout the game (rounds 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13, 16, 20), they've countered with scissors 5 times (rounds 3, 5, 13, 20), rock once (round 16), and paper twice (rounds 1, 9, 11). They clearly favor countering my paper with scissors.\n\n6. After playing scissors:\n   - After scissors in rounds 3, 5, 10, 13, 14, 18, 20, what did they play next?\n   - They followed scissors with paper 4 times, rock 2 times, and scissors once\n\n7. Given they've just played scissors, their most likely next move (based on history) would be paper.\n\n8. However, they might be trying to be less predictable now, especially since I've had some success reading their patterns.\n\n9. Given my recent loss with paper against their scissors, they might anticipate I'll play rock next and counter with paper.\n\n10. But their most consistent pattern throughout the game has been their tendency to play scissors (9/20 rounds), especially against my paper moves.\n\n11. To break this cycle and counter their potential paper play (their most common follow-up to scissors), scissors would be my best choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, anticipating they might play paper next (their most frequent follow-up to scissors) while also preparing to counter their potential adaptations to my recent moves.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
