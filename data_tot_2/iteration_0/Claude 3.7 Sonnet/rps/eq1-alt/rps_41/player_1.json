    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Given this potential tendency, Paper might be a slightly advantageous first move.\n6. But I should be careful not to overthink this - the opponent might be aware of these same patterns.\n7.

According to the standard rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors:\n   - Rock should beat Scissors\n   - Paper should beat Rock\n   - Scissors should beat Paper\n\n3. But in this last round, I played Scissors, the opponent played Rock, and I won. This suggests:\n   - Either there's a misunderstanding about the game rules\n   - Or the payoff matrix for this game is different from standard Rock, Paper, Scissors\n\n4. Let me recheck the game description to confirm the rules:\n   - According to the initial description: \"paper beats scissors\", \"rock beats paper\", \"scissors beats rock\"\n   - This is the reverse of standard RPS rules, which explains the outcome\n\n5. With this clarification, I understand that in this game:\n   - Paper beats Scissors (not the usual Scissors beats Paper)\n   - Rock beats Paper (same as usual)\n   - Scissors beats Rock (not the usual Rock beats Scissors)\n\n6. Given this understanding and my recent win with Scissors against Rock, the opponent might:\n   - Play Paper to beat my expected Scissors (if they think I'll repeat my winning move)\n   - Play Rock again (perhaps confused about the outcome)\n   - Play Scissors (to change strategy after losing)\n\n7. If they play Paper, my best response would be Scissors.\n8. If they play Rock, my best response would be Scissors.\n9. If they play Scissors, my best response would be Paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors again, as it beats Rock (which they just played) and would tie against Scissors (if they switch to that).\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

To counter Scissors, I should play Paper (according to the reversed rules).\n\n7. However, they might break their pattern now that I've demonstrated I can identify it.\n\n8. Considering our history of the game:\n   - Early on, we had many ties (suggesting similar reasoning)\n   - Then they went on a winning streak (suggesting they found a pattern in my play)\n   - Now I've correctly predicted their pattern once\n\n9. If they believe I've figured out their pattern, they might:\n   - Continue it, hoping I'll second-guess myself\n   - Break it deliberately with a different move\n   - Start a new pattern\n\n10. Given that I just won by correctly predicting their pattern, the most likely response is that they'll break the pattern.\n\n11. If they were going to play Scissors next in the pattern, they might instead play:\n   - Rock (to counter my expected Paper)\n   - Paper again (to be unpredictable)\n\n12. Of these alternatives, Rock seems more likely as it would directly counter what they might expect me to play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors, which would beat Rock if they break their pattern as I predict. This is a calculated risk, but breaking patterns after they've been detected is a common strategy in games like this.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Opponent's previous consistent pattern was:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n\n3. But instead of continuing with Scissors (as the pattern predicted), they played Scissors - breaking the pattern.\n\n4. Current move frequencies for opponent:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n\n5. Their moves are becoming more balanced across all three options.\n\n6. Now that they've broken their pattern, I need to consider what they might do next:\n   - They might start a new pattern\n   - They might play more randomly\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll play\n\n7. After a tie with Scissors, standard strategy might suggest playing Rock next (as Rock beats Paper, which beats Scissors).\n\n8. However, in these reversed rules, Paper beats Scissors, so they might expect me to play Paper.\n\n9. If they think I'll play Paper, they would play Rock to beat it.\n\n10. To counter their Rock, I should play Scissors.\n\n11. But they might also anticipate this double-thinking and play Paper instead.\n\n12. Given that they've broken their previous pattern and we just had a tie, I'll focus on making the strategically sound move in the context of the reversed rules.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, which directly counters our previous mutual move of Scissors according to the reversed rules. This is the most straightforward counter-move and doesn't rely on predicting multi-level thinking that could go either way.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
