Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3. Let's analyze the expected values of each move:\n   - Rock: Wins 3 points against paper, loses 1 point against scissors, ties with rock\n   - Paper: Wins 1 point against scissors, loses 3 points against rock, ties with paper\n   - Scissors: Wins 1 point against rock, loses 1 point against paper, ties with scissors\n\n4. The highest potential gain is from playing rock (3 points if opponent plays paper), but it also risks losing 1 point if opponent plays scissors.\n\n5. Paper has a moderate risk (losing 3 points if opponent plays rock) with only 1 point potential gain.\n\n6. Scissors has balanced risk-reward (both gain and loss are 1 point).\n\n7. Without prior information about the opponent, I'll choose rock for its higher potential gain.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This is interesting - the payoff matrix states that rock beats paper, which matches the outcome (I won 3 points). This suggests the description given at the beginning might have some moves reversed or there may be a different interpretation of the game.\n\n3. Based on the actual outcome, it seems the correct payoff structure is:\n   - Rock beats paper (winner: 3 points)\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner: 1 point) \n   - Scissors beats rock (winner: 1 point)\n\n4. My opponent played paper in the first round. They might:\n   - Continue with paper if they think I won't play rock again\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I might play scissors\n   - Switch to scissors anticipating I might play paper\n\n5. Since I just won with rock, my opponent might expect me to stick with the winning move. If they adjust, they would likely play scissors to beat my rock.\n\n6. I should counter this by playing paper, which would beat their scissors according to the observed payoff structure.\n\n7. However, if they anticipate this double-switch and stay with paper, I would lose. But if they switch to rock, my paper would lose.\n\n8. Given these considerations, I'll play rock again. If they stick with paper, I win again. If they switch to scissors expecting me to stay with rock, I lose but only 1 point compared to the 3 points I won last round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

There seems to be a pattern in my opponent's moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock.\n   If they continue this pattern, they might play paper next.\n\n4. Let me analyze what move would be best against paper:\n   - If rock beats paper (as seen in round 1), then I should play rock\n   - If paper beats rock (as traditional RPS would suggest), I should avoid rock\n\n5. Given the observed outcomes where rock beat paper (round 1) and rock beat paper (round 3), the evidence suggests rock is strong against paper.\n\n6. I'm now at a negative score (-1 + -3 = -4 points), so I need a winning move.\n\n7. My opponent's pattern suggests they'll play paper next, so I'll play rock to counter.\n\n8.

My opponent's moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. My current score remains at -4 points.\n\n4. My opponent has now played rock three times in the last four rounds, including two ties in a row with rock.\n\n5. After consecutive ties with the same move, there's often pressure to change moves. My opponent might expect me to switch from rock, and could:\n   - Play scissors to beat my potential paper\n   - Stay with rock expecting me to switch to scissors\n   - Switch to paper expecting me to stay with rock\n\n6. I need to consider:\n   - Two consecutive ties with rock suggests the opponent might switch\n   - The opponent has played rock frequently in recent rounds\n   - The highest value win would come from playing scissors against their potential paper\n\n7. Given the pattern of ties with rock, I think the opponent is more likely to switch than to play rock a third time in a row.\n\n8. Paper would be the safest move, winning against rock (3 points) and scissors (1 point) while only losing to paper (which is less likely given the recent pattern).\n\n9. However, I'll take a calculated risk and play scissors, anticipating they'll switch to paper after two consecutive rock plays. This gives me a chance to win 1 point, while only risking losing 1 point if they play paper instead.\n\n10. The breaking of the rock-rock tie pattern makes me believe a move change is highly likely.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

This result is surprising - I played scissors against rock and won. This contradicts my previous understanding where scissors should lose to rock.\n\n3. Let me reconsider the win conditions:\n   - When I played rock vs paper in Round 1, I won 3 points\n   - When I played paper vs scissors in Round 5, I won 1 point\n   - When I played scissors vs rock in Round 11, I won 1 point\n\n4. This suggests the payoff structure is:\n   - Rock beats paper (3 points)\n   - Paper beats scissors (1 point)\n   - Scissors beats rock (1 point)\n\n5. My current score: -4 + 1 = -3 points.\n\n6. My opponent's moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   They've played rock three consecutive times now.\n\n7. Given they've played rock three times in a row, they might:\n   - Continue with rock, thinking I wouldn't expect a fourth repetition\n   - Switch to paper or scissors, expecting me to play scissors again\n\n8. Based on the corrected understanding of the game:\n   - If they play rock again, scissors would win me 1 point\n   - If they play paper, rock would win me 3 points\n   - If they switch to scissors, paper would win me 1 point\n\n9. Since rock has been their most frequent choice, and they've played it three times consecutively now, I'll play scissors again to counter rock.\n\n10. This gives me a good chance for another win while limiting potential losses if they switch.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My current score: -3 - 1 = -4 points.\n\n4. After playing rock three times in a row, my opponent switched to paper. This was unexpected and shows they're adapting their strategy.\n\n5. I need to review the payoff structure again based on all outcomes:\n   - Rock beats paper: In Round 1, I won 3 points playing rock against paper\n   - Scissors beats rock: In Round 11, I won 1 point playing scissors against rock\n   - Paper beats scissors: In Round 5, I won 1 point playing paper against scissors\n   This confirms the unusual but consistent payoff structure.\n\n6. My opponent has now shown a complete switch from playing rock repeatedly to playing paper. They might:\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I might switch to paper\n   - Switch to scissors anticipating I might switch to rock\n\n7. Given they just dramatically changed their strategy, they might be more likely to stick with paper for at least one more round to see if I adjust.\n\n8. My options:\n   - If they play paper again, rock would win me 3 points\n   - If they switch to rock, scissors would win me 1 point\n   - If they switch to scissors, paper would win me 1 point\n\n9. Since I need to improve my negative score and the highest potential gain is from playing rock against paper, I'll choose rock.\n\n10.

Looking at how they've responded to my scissors plays:\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost)\n   \n   There's a slight tendency for them to play paper against my scissors.\n\n9. Given they just played paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to scissors anticipating I might switch to paper\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I might switch to rock\n\n10. I'll play rock, which would win 3 points against paper if they repeat it, and only lose 1 point to scissors if they switch.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My current score: -1 - 1 = -2 points.\n\n4. The opponent has switched from paper to scissors. Looking at their most recent moves:\n   rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n   There seems to be some alternating pattern with paper and scissors recently.\n\n5. Looking at my recent performance, I've lost the last two rounds. I need to be more unpredictable.\n\n6. My recent moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, cycling through all three options.\n\n7. Given the opponent has played scissors twice in the last three rounds, they might:\n   - Play scissors again if they think I'll play paper\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I might play scissors\n   - Switch to paper anticipating I might play rock\n\n8. Looking at how they've responded after playing scissors:\n   - After scissors in round 2, they played rock\n   - After scissors in rounds 4-5, they played rock\n   - After scissors in round 9, they played rock\n   - After scissors in round 13, they played rock\n   - After scissors in round 16, they played paper\n   - After scissors in round 18, they might follow the dominant pattern and play rock\n\n9. Based on this analysis, they're most likely to play rock next. I'll play scissors, which would win me 1 point against rock.\n\n10. This also protects me from losing big if they play paper, as scissors would only lose 1 point against paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
