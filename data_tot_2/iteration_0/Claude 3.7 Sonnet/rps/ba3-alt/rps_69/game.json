This is an unusual variant of rock-paper-scissors with asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Rock has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also highest risk (-3 points)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower rewards/penalties (1 point/-1 point)\n\n3. For the first move against a new player, I don't have information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n4. Given the asymmetric payoffs, I should consider:\n   - Rock is high-risk, high-reward\n   - Paper is lower risk but vulnerable to rock (highest penalty)\n   - Scissors is lower risk and would beat rock (which might be a common opening move due to its high reward potential)\n\n5. Since this is the first move and I have no information about the opponent, I'll choose scissors as it has balanced risk-reward and could counter a rock-first strategy.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I've now won seven consecutive rounds by correctly predicting and countering my opponent's moves. Their pattern remains extremely consistent, so I'll continue exploiting it.\n\n7. This has been a remarkable turnaround from the beginning of the game where I lost the first few rounds.

The opponent has shown no deviation from their pattern throughout the entire game.\n\n3. Following this pattern, they will play rock next.\n\n4. Against rock, my best move would be scissors (which beats rock for +1 point).\n\n5. I've now won eighteen consecutive rounds by correctly predicting and countering their moves.\n\n6. This game demonstrates the importance of:\n   - Pattern recognition\n   - Adapting to the actual rules (rather than assumed ones)\n   - Consistent strategy execution\n\n7.

The payoffs are asymmetrical - rock beating paper has the highest reward/penalty (3 points), while the other combinations only have 1 point at stake.\n\n3. Against a fresh player with no established pattern, I need to consider what most people might choose first. In standard rock-paper-scissors, research suggests many people choose rock first.\n\n4. If they choose rock first, my best response would be scissors, which would give me +1 point.\n\n5. However, if they choose paper (expecting me to choose rock), I would lose 3 points.\n\n6. If they choose scissors and I choose rock, I would gain 1 point.\n\n7. Given the asymmetrical payoff structure, rock seems like a relatively safe first move - I could win 1 point or lose 3 points, but rock has an advantage against scissors which is common.\n\n8.

This is an unusual variant of rock-paper-scissors with asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Rock has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also highest risk (-3 points)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower rewards/penalties (1 point/-1 point)\n\n3. For the first move against a new player, I don't have information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n4. Given the asymmetric payoffs, I should consider:\n   - Rock is high-risk, high-reward\n   - Paper is lower risk but vulnerable to rock (highest penalty)\n   - Scissors is lower risk and would beat rock (which might be a common opening move due to its high reward potential)\n\n5. Since this is the first move and I have no information about the opponent, I'll choose scissors as it has balanced risk-reward and could counter a rock-first strategy.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

The payoffs are asymmetric in this game. Rock beating paper yields the highest points (+3), whereas the other winning combinations yield fewer points (+1).\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n4. People often choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, but this is just a tendency, not a rule.\n\n5. If I choose rock and they choose scissors, I win +1.

For the first move against an unknown opponent, I'll choose paper:\n   - If they play rock (common first move), I win 1 point\n   - If they play scissors, I lose only 1 point\n   - If they play paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5.

This is different from standard rock-paper-scissors because the rewards are asymmetric.\n   - Rock beating paper has the highest reward/penalty (+3/-3)\n   - The other matchups have smaller rewards/penalties (+1/-1)\n\n3. Given this asymmetry, there's an incentive for players to choose rock more frequently, as it has the highest potential reward.\n\n4.

The opponent knows that playing scissors again could lead to another tie if I don't change my move.\n\n5. One strategy is to play rock, which would have beaten their previous move (scissors).

But the last round's result contradicts these rules. If I played rock and they played paper, I should have lost according to standard rules. But I won 3 points.\n\n4. This means the rules must be different than standard rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Rock must beat paper (giving me 3 points)\n   - Scissors must beat rock (explaining round 5 result)\n   - By process of elimination, paper must beat scissors\n\n5.

Based on these outcomes, it appears the actual rules are:\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point\n\n3. This is different from what was originally stated, but I'll proceed with these empirically observed rules.\n\n4.

Let me go through the entire game history again with the outcomes:\n   - Round 1: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost 3 points)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won 1 point)\n\n4. Based on these outcomes, the following rule interpretations would make sense:\n   - Round 2: Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Round 3: Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Round 4: Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n   - Round 5: Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n   - Round 6: Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Round 7: Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n\n5. This is still confusing because it contradicts itself. If paper beats scissors in round 7, why did scissors lose to paper in round 3?\n\n6. This suggests the rule reporting might be inconsistent, or there might be some other factor at play.\n\n7. However, I notice my opponent has been following a strict pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n\n8.
