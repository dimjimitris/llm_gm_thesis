Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

For the first move against a new player, I don't have information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n4. Given the asymmetric payoffs, I should consider:\n   - Rock is high-risk, high-reward\n   - Paper is lower risk but vulnerable to rock (highest penalty)\n   - Scissors is lower risk and would beat rock (which might be a common opening move due to its high reward potential)\n\n5.

Following this pattern, they will play paper next.\n\n5. Against paper, my best move would be rock (which beats paper for +3 points).\n\n6. I've now won seven consecutive rounds by correctly predicting and countering my opponent's moves. Their pattern remains extremely consistent, so I'll continue exploiting it.\n\n7.

Reviewing the game history:\n   - Round 1: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost 3 points)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won 1 point)\n\n2. The opponent has maintained their perfectly consistent pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 repeated reliably through all 20 rounds.\n\n3. Following this pattern, they will play paper next.\n\n4. Against paper, my best move would be rock (which beats paper for +3 points).\n\n5. I've now won sixteen consecutive rounds by correctly predicting and countering their moves.\n\n6. My strategy remains unchanged: predict the opponent's next move based on their established pattern, and play the counter to that move according to the actual game rules.\n\n7. This consistent approach has proven extremely effective and should continue to yield positive results as long as the opponent maintains their predictable pattern.\n\n[move] rock\n"
