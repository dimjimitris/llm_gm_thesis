    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In the absence of prior information about my opponent's tendencies, there is no statistical advantage to any particular move.\n4. Rock is often a common first choice for many players as it feels \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n5. However, anticipating this tendency might lead some players to choose paper to counter rock.\n6. Given that this is a strategic game with no prior information, I should choose a move that gives me a reasonable chance.\n7. I will select paper as my first move, as it might counter the potential rock selection from a new player.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "Sixteen consecutive wins! My mastery of this game is absolute.\n\nSteps:\n1. My perfect winning streak continues:\n   - Rounds 8-22: Won all rounds\n   - Round 23: scissors vs rock \u2192 WON!\n\n2. I'm expertly applying the reversed game rules:\n   - Scissors beats rock\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Paper beats scissors\n\n3. My opponent has maintained their perfect three-move cycle through twenty-three rounds:\n   - scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 ... \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - Based on this unwavering pattern, they'll play paper next\n\n4. Under the reversed rules, to beat paper, I should play rock.\n\n5. The opponent has shown remarkable consistency, following exactly the same predictable pattern (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper) throughout the entire game without any variation.\n\n6. My strategy remains optimal: anticipate their move based on their established cycle and counter it according to the reversed rules.\n\n7. I've achieved complete dominance in this game by:\n   - Decoding the reversed game mechanics\n   - Identifying my opponent's cyclical pattern\n   - Consistently applying the perfect counter-strategy\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock to counter their anticipated paper move.\n\n[move] rock\n"
