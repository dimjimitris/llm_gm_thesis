This is the first round against a fresh player, so I have no prior information about their strategy.\n\n3. In the absence of information about opponent tendencies, each of the three moves has equal expected value.\n\n4. Many inexperienced players tend to choose rock slightly more often as their first move, though this is not guaranteed.\n\n5. I should avoid being too predictable in future rounds, so starting with a varied strategy is good.\n\n6. Since I have no clear advantage for any particular move, I'll select one that might have a slight psychological edge.\n\n7. Paper is sometimes chosen less frequently as a first move, which could give me a slight edge against a player who favors rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for my first move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Their pattern has been consistent throughout: they rotate through rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper with some variations, but always in that general sequence.\n\n4. Interestingly, they played rock in Round 11, when I expected scissors based on their previous pattern.\n\n5. Looking at the outcomes more carefully:\n   - Rounds 1-6: Initial learning phase with mostly ties and two losses\n   - Rounds 7-9: I won three consecutive rounds\n   - Rounds 10-11: I lost one round, then tied\n\n6. There might be a meta-game where the rules change after a certain number of consecutive wins, or the opponent adapts their strategy.\n\n7. Given their recent moves and apparent pattern break (rock when scissors was expected), they might play paper next as they've frequently followed rock with paper.\n\n8. If the rules remain consistent with what I observed in most rounds:\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n9. To counter their likely paper move, I should play scissors.\n\n10. However, given the uncertainties and inconsistencies I've observed, this is still somewhat of a calculated risk.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, anticipating they'll play paper next based on their historical pattern.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

We've now had two consecutive ties, which is interesting. My opponent continues to follow their general pattern of rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, but our moves have aligned twice in a row.\n\n4. If their pattern holds, they would play rock next, following their scissors play.\n\n5. However, after two consecutive ties, they might try to break the pattern or anticipate my next move.\n\n6. The game rules based on the majority of outcomes appear to be:\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n7. If they play rock as their pattern suggests, I should play scissors to win (assuming scissors beats rock).\n\n8. There's a risk they'll deviate from their pattern after two ties, but their consistent behavior throughout 12 rounds suggests they're likely to continue with it.\n\n9. Given the information available, playing scissors against their expected rock gives me the best chance of winning according to the rules I've observed most consistently.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, anticipating they'll follow their pattern and play rock next.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They played paper instead of the expected rock, breaking their previous pattern. This is significant because it's the first major deviation from their established pattern.\n\n4. I've now lost twice with scissors against paper (Rounds 10 and 13). This consistently suggests that paper beats scissors in this game.\n\n5. Looking at all winning/losing rounds:\n   - Round 1: Paper (me) vs Rock (them) - I lost \u2192 Rock beats Paper\n   - Round 6: Paper (me) vs Rock (them) - I lost \u2192 Rock beats Paper\n   - Round 7: Rock (me) vs Paper (them) - I won \u2192 Rock beats Paper\n   - Round 8: Paper (me) vs Scissors (them) - I won \u2192 Paper beats Scissors\n   - Round 9: Scissors (me) vs Rock (them) - I won \u2192 Scissors beats Rock\n   - Round 10: Scissors (me) vs Paper (them) - I lost \u2192 Paper beats Scissors\n   - Round 13: Scissors (me) vs Paper (them) - I lost \u2192 Paper beats Scissors\n\n6. This confirms the inverse Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n\n7. The inconsistency in Round 7 (where I won with rock against paper) is an anomaly that I can't explain with the available information.\n\n8. Now that my opponent has deviated from their pattern, I need to be more cautious about predicting their next move.\n\n9. Given they just played paper, and considering they might be developing a new pattern, they could play:\n   - Rock (if starting a new rotation)\n   - Scissors (if following the inverse winning logic)\n   - Paper again (if trying to be unpredictable)\n\n10. The safest play against this uncertainty would be rock, as:\n    - It beats paper if they repeat it\n    - It ties with rock if they play that\n    - It loses to scissors, but that's just one possibility\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, given the uncertainty about their next move but considering they just played paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Since I just won with rock against their paper, and considering the unpredictability of their recent moves, my best option might be to stick with rock, which has won against paper twice.\n\n8. If they switch to scissors expecting me to play paper, rock would lose to scissors (based on the observed pattern where scissors beats rock).\n\n9. Given all uncertainties, rock seems to give me the best chance as:\n   - It has worked against their paper twice\n   - They've shown a tendency to repeat moves recently\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock again for this round, based on my recent success with it against their paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Now I've lost with rock against scissors, which is consistent with the inverse Rock-Paper-Scissors rules where scissors beats rock.\n\n4. Let me update the win/loss rules based on all results:\n   - Rock beats Paper: Rounds 7, 14 (I win)\n   - Paper beats Rock: Rounds 1, 6 (I lose)\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Round 8 (I win)\n   - Scissors beats Paper: Rounds 10, 13 (I lose)\n   - Scissors beats Rock: Round 9 (I win), Round 15 (I lose)\n\n5. There's still inconsistency in who wins with which combination. However, the most consistent interpretation is:\n   - When I play the move that would win in traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors, I lose\n   - When I play the move that would lose in traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors, I win\n   - This is except for Rounds 7, 8, 9, and 14 where the results were opposite\n\n6. My opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 11: rock\n   - Round 12: scissors\n   - Round 13: paper\n   - Round 14: paper\n   - Round 15: scissors\n\n7. They've become less predictable, but are now playing scissors after paper, breaking their earlier pattern completely.\n\n8. Given they just played scissors, they might:\n   - Play rock next (following a scissors \u2192 rock pattern they used earlier)\n   - Continue to be unpredictable with another scissors or paper\n\n9. Based on the most consistent rule interpretation and their history, if they play rock next, my best move would be paper (as paper would traditionally lose to rock, which means I might win).\n\n10. This is still highly uncertain, but paper gives me the best chance against their most likely next move of rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round, anticipating they might play rock next.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My updated score tally:\n   - Wins: 8 rounds (+8 points)\n   - Losses: 5 rounds (-5 points)\n   - Ties: 5 rounds (0 points)\n   - Total: +3 points\n\n5. My opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 15: scissors\n   - Round 16: scissors\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: paper\n\n6. They've now played rock \u2192 paper, which suggests they might continue the sequence with scissors next.\n\n7. My recent wins all follow the inverse Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:\n   - Round 14: Rock beats Paper\n   - Round 16: Paper beats Scissors\n   - Round 17: Scissors beats Rock\n   - Round 18: Rock beats Paper\n\n8. If they play scissors next (continuing their pattern), I should play paper to win (since paper beats scissors in inverse rules).\n\n9. After four consecutive losses, they might try to break their pattern or predict my next move. However, they've generally been consistent with patterns throughout the game.\n\n10. Given the strong evidence for inverse rules and their likely next move being scissors, paper gives me the best chance of winning again.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round, anticipating they might play scissors based on their recent pattern.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-1 points)\n\n2. My opponent played rock instead of the expected scissors, breaking their previous pattern.\n\n3. I've now lost with paper against rock, which is consistent with the inverse rules but breaks my winning streak.\n\n4. Looking at paper vs. rock outcomes throughout the game:\n   - Round 1: Paper (me) vs Rock (them) - I lost\n   - Round 6: Paper (me) vs Rock (them) - I lost\n   - Round 19: Paper (me) vs Rock (them) - I lost\n\n5. This consistently shows that paper loses to rock in this game.\n\n6. My opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 16: scissors\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: paper\n   - Round 19: rock\n\n7. They seem to be adapting their strategy and becoming less predictable, possibly in response to my winning streak.\n\n8. My updated score tally:\n   - Wins: 8 rounds (+8 points)\n   - Losses: 6 rounds (-6 points)\n   - Ties: 5 rounds (0 points)\n   - Total: +2 points\n\n9. Given that they've just played rock and have become less predictable, they might:\n   - Play scissors next (if following rock \u2192 scissors pattern they've shown before)\n   - Play paper (to complete a rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors cycle)\n   - Repeat rock (since it just worked for them)\n\n10. If they play scissors, my best move would be paper.\n    If they play paper, my best move would be rock.\n    If they play rock again, my best move would be scissors.\n\n11. Given their tendency to switch moves after wins and the pattern they've shown most frequently, scissors seems most likely from them.\n\n12. To counter scissors with the inverse rules, I should play paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round, anticipating they might play scissors based on their historical patterns after playing rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They've now played rock twice in a row, which is a significant change in their behavior.\n\n7. Since they've won twice with rock, they might:\n   - Continue with rock for a third time (since it's working)\n   - Switch to paper expecting me to play scissors to counter their rock\n   - Switch to scissors thinking I might play rock to counter their rock\n\n8. Given they've repeated rock successfully twice, there's a decent chance they'll continue with it.\n\n9. To counter rock using the inverse rules, I should play scissors.\n\n10. However, they might be anticipating this exact adaptation and switch to paper.\n\n11. After careful consideration, the most rational move is still scissors, as:\n    - It counters rock (their most recently played and repeated move)\n    - It breaks the cycle of my playing paper and losing\n    - It's been successful for me against rock earlier in the game (Round 17)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, anticipating they might continue with rock given their recent success with it.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
