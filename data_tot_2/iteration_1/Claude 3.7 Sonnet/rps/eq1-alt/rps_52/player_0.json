Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, studies show first-time players tend to choose rock more often, as it's perceived as \"strong\".\n4. If the opponent expects me to be strategic, they might anticipate me choosing paper to counter their expected rock.\n5. This could lead them to choose scissors to counter my paper.\n6. Therefore, I could choose rock to beat their scissors.\n7. But this level of mind games may be overthinking for a first move.\n8.

There's also a possibility they might dramatically switch strategies to try to catch me off guard.\n11.

Round 12: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I won)\n13. My opponent chose scissors for the second round in a row.\n14. This follows their established pattern of sticking with a move for multiple rounds.\n15. However, they lost with scissors in the last round.\n16. Their past behavior suggests they typically stay with a move even after one loss.\n17. But after multiple consecutive losses, they tend to switch strategies.\n18. Given they've only lost once with scissors so far, they're likely to stick with it for at least one more round.\n19. If they continue with scissors, paper remains my best choice (as paper beats scissors in this variant).\n20. If they anticipate my paper play and switch to rock, I would lose.\n21. Given their demonstrated pattern persistence, scissors remains their most likely choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper again for this thirteenth round.\n\n[move] paper\n"
