            "text": "Another tie - we both played paper this time.\n\nLet me correct my previous confusion. Looking back at the game rules:\n- Paper beats rock (not scissors)\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nSo in Round 12, I played scissors against their rock, which should have resulted in a loss for me. There might have been a reporting error or I misunderstood the outcome.\n\nComplete updated history:\n- Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1)\n- Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3)\n- Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1)\n- Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n- Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3)\n- Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1) [possible error]\n- Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+3) [possible error]\n- Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 tie (0)\n- Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3)\n- Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 tie (0)\n- Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 tie (0)\n- Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1) [possible error]\n- Round 13: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 tie (0)\n\nTheir sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\nSince they just played paper, and they have generally followed paper with scissors (in rounds 3-4 and 7-8), I'll plan accordingly:\n\n[move] Rock. My opponent just played paper and has historically followed paper with scissors. Rock beats scissors, giving me the best chance of a positive outcome.\n"
