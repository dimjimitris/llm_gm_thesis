Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. This is an asymmetric version of rock-paper-scissors where the rewards aren't equal. Rock-paper has the highest stakes (\u00b13 points), while the other matchups have lower stakes (\u00b11 point).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a new player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n4. In standard rock-paper-scissors theory, the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with 1/3 probability. However, the uneven payoffs here change the optimal strategy.\n\n5. With the given payoffs, rock seems risky but potentially rewarding. If I play rock, I either win big (3 points) or lose small (-1 point).\n\n6. Since this is the first move and I have no information on my opponent, I'll choose rock as it has the best risk-reward ratio - high potential gain if I win against paper, and limited loss if I lose against scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The safest move against this uncertainty would be paper:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - Paper ties with paper (0 points)\n   - Paper loses to rock (-3 points)\n\n7. However, given they've played scissors twice in a row, they're more likely to switch to something else.\n\n8. If I believe they're most likely to play paper next (expecting me to play scissors), then my best counter would be rock (+3 points).\n\n9. If I believe they're most likely to play rock next (to counter my potential paper), then my best counter would be scissors (+1 point).\n\n10. Given the high reward potential of rock beating paper (+3) and the increasingly unpredictable nature of my opponent, I'll choose the move with the highest potential payoff.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, anticipating they might switch to paper after two scissors plays, giving me the chance for the highest possible gain in this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Summarizing all previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n\n2. My current score is 5 + 1 = 6 points.\n\n3. The rules are now clearly established:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n\n4. My opponent's most recent moves:\n   scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   \n   They seem to be cycling through the options in this order.\n\n5. My recent moves:\n   scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   \n   I've been alternating between rock and scissors in the last few rounds.\n\n6. After playing rock (which I beat with scissors), my opponent might:\n   - Play rock again (less likely)\n   - Switch to paper (following their cycling pattern)\n   - Switch to scissors (trying to counter my potential next move)\n\n7. If they follow their apparent cycling pattern (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?), they would play paper next.\n\n8. Against paper, my best move would be rock (+3 points).\n\n9. However, my opponent might have noticed I just played scissors twice with one round in between, and might anticipate me playing scissors again. In that case, they might play paper to counter.\n\n10. If I play rock and they play paper, I win big (+3 points).\n    If I play rock and they play scissors, I lose small (-1 point).\n    If I play rock and they play rock, it's a tie (0 points).\n\n11. The expected value calculation favors rock, especially if there's a higher probability they'll play paper (following their recent cycling pattern).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, anticipating they might follow their apparent cycle and play paper next.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's most recent moves:\n   paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   \n   Instead of following the pattern I anticipated (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), they played scissors.\n\n4. This suggests they might be deliberately trying to counter my moves rather than following a predictable pattern.\n\n5. Let me look at my recent sequence and my opponent's responses:\n   - Round 16: I played rock, they played paper (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, they played scissors (I lost)\n\n   It seems they've started playing the move that would have lost to my previous move.\n\n6. If this pattern continues, after I played rock, they'd respond to that by playing the move that would have lost to rock, which is paper.\n\n7. Against their expected paper, my best move would be rock (+3 points).\n\n8. However, they might also recognize that I've caught onto this pattern and change their strategy.\n\n9. Given the evolving nature of the game and that my opponent might be employing adaptive strategies, I should consider the move with the best risk-reward profile.\n\n10. Paper has a balanced risk-reward profile:\n    - Paper beats scissors (+1 point)\n    - Paper loses to rock (-3 points)\n    - Paper ties with paper (0 points)\n\n11. Given my uncertainty about my opponent's next move and the fact they just played scissors (which paper beats), paper seems like a reasonable choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, which counters their most recent move (scissors) and has a relatively balanced risk-reward profile in this uncertain situation.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My current score is 5 + 1 = 6 points.\n\n3. Wait, I need to double-check this result. I played paper against scissors and won? This contradicts the rules we've established. Let me verify the rules again:\n\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n\n4. Yes, paper beats scissors according to our established rules, so winning 1 point makes sense.\n\n5. My opponent's most recent moves:\n   rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   \n   They've played scissors twice in a row now.\n\n6. Looking at the outcome sequence more carefully:\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, they played rock, I won (scissors beats rock)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, they played scissors, I lost (scissors beats rock)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, they played scissors, I won (paper beats scissors)\n\n7. The rules are consistently:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n\n8. After playing scissors twice in a row, my opponent might:\n   - Play scissors a third time (less likely)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I might play scissors to counter their scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (anticipating I might play rock to counter their scissors)\n\n9. If they play scissors again, my best move would be paper (+1 point).\n   If they switch to rock, my best move would be scissors (+1 point).\n   If they switch to paper, my best move would be rock (+3 points).\n\n10. Given that they've played scissors twice in a row and might expect me to counter with paper again, they're most likely to switch to rock.\n\n11.

This strong commitment to scissors is unusual and suggests they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (showing a strong preference)\n   - Finally switch to another move, likely rock (anticipating I'll play paper to counter their scissors)\n   - Use this streak of scissors to deliberately set up a trap\n\n5.

If they expect me to play paper, they would play rock.\n   If they expect me to play scissors again, they might play scissors again or switch to rock.\n\n7. Given their strong preference for scissors in recent rounds, paper would be my best counter if they continue this pattern (+1 point).\n\n8. However, after three consecutive scissors plays, there's an increasing probability they'll switch, likely to rock.\n\n9. Against their potential rock, my best move would be scissors (+1 point).\n\n10. This is a critical decision point. If they continue with scissors, paper wins. If they switch to rock as I expect, scissors wins.\n\n11. Given the unusual persistence with scissors for three rounds, I think they're more likely to finally switch now than to continue with a fourth scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, anticipating they'll finally switch to rock after playing scissors three times in a row.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
