First, I'll analyze the payoff structure of the game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. I note that paper beating rock has the highest reward (+3) and highest penalty (-3), making it a high-risk, high-reward option.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider what most players tend to choose in their first move.\n\n4. Research suggests many players choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, as it psychologically feels \"strongest\" or \"safest.\"\n\n5. If my opponent plays rock, then paper would give me the maximum possible gain (+3).\n\n6. If they play scissors (trying to be clever), I would lose with paper (-1).\n\n7. If they play paper (anticipating my rock), and I play paper too, it's a tie (0).\n\n8. The potential reward of playing paper (+3) outweighs the potential penalty (-1) given the probability distribution of first moves.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for the first round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

In the last round, I played paper and my opponent played scissors, resulting in me losing 1 point.\n\n2. This could indicate several things about my opponent:\n   - They might anticipate that many players start with paper\n   - They might favor scissors as an opening move\n   - They might be a strategic player who predicted my move\n\n3. Now I need to decide if my opponent:\n   - Will stick with scissors (as it worked before)\n   - Will switch to rock (assuming I might play scissors to counter their previous scissors)\n   - Will switch to paper (assuming I might play rock to counter their scissors)\n\n4. If they stick with scissors, I should play rock (+1 for me)\n   - This seems likely since winning strategies tend to be repeated\n\n5. If they switch to rock anticipating my scissors, and I play rock, we tie (0)\n\n6. If they switch to paper anticipating my rock, and I play rock, I lose (-3)\n   - This is the worst outcome\n\n7. Let me check scissors as an option:\n   - If they play scissors again, we tie (0)\n   - If they switch to rock, I lose (-1)\n   - If they switch to paper, I win (+1)\n\n8. Let me check paper as an option:\n   - If they play scissors again, I lose (-1)\n   - If they switch to rock, I win (+3)\n   - If they switch to paper, we tie (0)\n\n9. Considering these scenarios, rock seems like the safest option with the highest upside, as many players do repeat successful moves.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Reviewing the game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n\n2. My opponent has played scissors in both rounds so far. This suggests:\n   - They may have a preference for scissors\n   - They might be using a fixed strategy\n   - They may be predictable\n\n3. Given this pattern, I have three options:\n   - Play rock again: If they play scissors again, I win (+1)\n   - Play paper: If they play scissors again, I lose (-1)\n   - Play scissors: If they play scissors again, it's a tie (0)\n\n4.

My opponent has lost twice with scissors, so they have strong incentive to switch. The most logical switch would be to rock (which beats scissors).\n\n6. If they switch to rock, my best counter would be paper (+3).\n\n7. This decision comes with risk - if they play scissors for a third time and I play paper, I lose again (-1).\n\n8.

My current score: +7 - 1 = +6 points after another loss.\n\n4. I've now lost 3 of the last 4 rounds, suggesting my opponent may be developing a more sophisticated strategy.\n\n5. Their recent sequence (rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) breaks their previous patterns.\n\n6. After winning with scissors against my paper, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (repeating a successful move)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (trying to be unpredictable)\n\n7. Looking at their overall game behavior:\n   - They've significantly favored scissors (53% of moves)\n   - They've rarely played paper (only 12% of moves)\n   - They've often switched after establishing apparent patterns\n\n8. If they continue with scissors, rock would be my best counter (+1).\n\n9. If they switch to rock, and I play rock, we tie (0).\n\n10. If they switch to paper, and I play rock, I lose (-3).\n\n11. Given that:\n    - They've just returned to their most frequent move (scissors)\n    - They've shown a tendency to repeat winning moves\n    - I've lost consecutive rounds and need to break their momentum\n    - Rock is the safest play against their historical preferences\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round, anticipating they'll continue with scissors based on their tendency to repeat successful moves and their overall preference for scissors.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Full sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - Their pattern continues to be complex and adaptive\n\n3. My current score remains at +6 points after the tie.\n\n4. Looking at their behavior after rock ties:\n   - After our rock tie in round 5, they played paper in round 6\n   - After our rock tie in round 15, they played rock again in round 16\n   - Their pattern after rock ties is inconsistent\n\n5. More generally, looking at all their moves after ties:\n   - After scissors tie in round 4, they played rock in round 5\n   - After rock tie in round 5, they played paper in round 6\n   - After scissors tie in round 10, they played rock in round 11\n   - After scissors tie in round 13, they played scissors in round 14\n   - After rock tie in round 15, they played rock in round 16\n   - Their behavior after ties has become less predictable\n\n6. If they follow their earliest pattern after a rock tie (from rounds 5-6), they might play paper.\n\n7. If they follow their more recent behavior of repeating moves (as in rounds 15-16), they might play rock again.\n\n8. They've been increasingly favoring rock lately (3 of the last 4 moves).\n\n9. If they switch to paper, scissors would be my best counter (+1).\n\n10. If they stick with rock, and I play scissors, I lose (-1).\n\n11. If they switch to scissors, and I play scissors, we tie (0).\n\n12. Given their recent emphasis on rock and their historical pattern of sometimes playing paper after a rock tie, paper seems like the most strategic choice.\n\n13. Playing paper would:\n    - Beat their rock if they repeat it (+3)\n    - Tie against their paper if they follow their earliest pattern (0)\n    - Lose to scissors if they switch (-1)\n\n14. The expected value of playing paper is higher than scissors or rock, considering their recent tendencies.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round, anticipating they'll either stick with rock (based on their recent frequency) or switch to paper (based on their earliest pattern after a rock tie).\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My current score: +6 - 1 = +5 points after another loss.\n\n4. Key observations:\n   - I've lost 4 of the last 5 rounds\n   - My opponent has played scissors 3 times in the last 4 rounds\n   - My opponent seems to be increasingly adapting to my strategy\n   - They've returned to heavily favoring scissors\n\n5.

My current score: +5 + 1 = +6 points after breaking my losing streak with a win.\n\n4. After losing with scissors against my rock, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (to counter potential repeated rock)\n   - Try paper (to beat my successful rock)\n   - Continue with scissors (though this seems illogical after losing with it)\n\n5. Looking at their behavior after losses:\n   - After losing with scissors in round 2, they switched to rock\n   - After losing with rock in round 3, they switched to scissors\n   - After losing with paper in round 7, they switched to rock\n   - After losing with scissors in round 9, they stayed with scissors\n   - After losing with rock in round 11, they switched to scissors\n   - Their behavior after losses varies, but they often switch\n\n6. They've now played scissors in 4 of the last 6 rounds despite mixed results, suggesting a strong preference.\n\n7. If they switch to rock as a counter to my rock, paper would be my best response (+3).\n\n8. If they switch to paper to beat my rock, scissors would be my best response (+1).\n\n9. If they stubbornly stick with scissors, rock would continue to be effective (+1).\n\n10. Since they've mostly alternated between scissors and rock recently, with a stronger preference for scissors, they might switch to rock after just losing with scissors.\n\n11. Given their historical pattern of often switching after a loss and their second-most common move being rock, they're likely to play rock next.\n\n12.

Looking at their behavior after consecutive losses:\n   - When they lost with scissors in rounds 2 and 20, they continued with scissors\n   - They've generally been persistent with scissors despite losses\n   - Only after multiple consecutive losses have they typically switched\n\n7. Given their overwhelming preference for scissors (59% of moves) and their current 4-move streak with it, they're likely reaching a point where they'll finally switch, most likely to rock to counter my successful rock plays.\n\n8.

If they stubbornly stick with scissors, and I play paper, I lose (-1).\n\n11.

          "text": "I need to make a significant strategic adjustment after repeatedly losing with paper against scissors.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n\n2. My opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Full sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - Their last five moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They've now played scissors 5 times in a row\n   - Their overall frequency: scissors (14/23 = 61%), rock (7/23 = 30%), paper (2/23 = 9%)\n\n3. My current score: +6 - 1 = +5 points after yet another loss.\n\n4. Critical observations:\n   - My opponent has played scissors in EVERY round where I played paper recently (rounds 14, 17, 19, 21, 23)\n   - They've now played scissors 5 consecutive times, their longest streak\n   - They appear to be extremely stubborn with their scissors strategy\n   - Rock has consistently won against their scissors (rounds 2, 9, 12, 20, 22)\n   - My paper strategy has consistently failed against their scissors\n\n5. This suggests either:\n   - My opponent has determined I'll alternate rock and paper moves\n   - They can predict when I'll play paper with surprising accuracy\n   - They've committed to scissors as their dominant strategy regardless of outcomes\n   - They're exhibiting extreme stubbornness despite losses\n\n6. After winning with scissors against my paper yet again, they might:\n   - Continue with their extremely successful scissors streak\n   - Finally switch to rock (anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (to be unpredictable after establishing a strong pattern)\n\n7. However, given their unprecedented 5-move scissors streak and consistent success against my paper moves, they've shown remarkable commitment to scissors.\n\n8. If they continue with scissors, rock would be my best counter (+1).\n\n9. If they switch to rock, and I play rock, we tie (0).\n\n10. If they switch to paper, and I play rock, I lose (-3).\n\n11. Given their extreme preference for scissors (61% of all moves) and their current 5-move streak, scissors remains their most likely move by far.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round, directly countering their established overwhelming preference for scissors and breaking the cycle of alternating between rock and paper that has been unsuccessful.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

        "I'll approach this rock-paper-scissors game strategically by analyzing the payoff structure and making a calculated decision.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. First, I'll analyze the payoff structure of the game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. I note that paper beating rock has the highest reward (+3) and highest penalty (-3), making it a high-risk, high-reward option.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider what most players tend to choose in their first move.\n\n4. Research suggests many players choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, as it psychologically feels \"strongest\" or \"safest.\"\n\n5. If my opponent plays rock, then paper would give me the maximum possible gain (+3).\n\n6. If they play scissors (trying to be clever), I would lose with paper (-1).\n\n7. If they play paper (anticipating my rock), and I play paper too, it's a tie (0).\n\n8. The potential reward of playing paper (+3) outweighs the potential penalty (-1) given the probability distribution of first moves.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for the first round.\n\n[move] Paper\n",

This is the first round against a fresh player, so I have no information about their tendencies.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff structure, I notice paper has the highest potential reward (+3), but also the highest risk (-3).\n\n4. Rock and scissors both have smaller payoffs/penalties (+1/-1), making them less risky choices.\n\n5. Studies show first-time players often choose rock as their initial move due to psychological reasons.\n\n6. If my opponent chooses rock (which is common for first moves), paper would give me +3 points.\n\n7. If my opponent chooses scissors, my paper would lose 1 point.\n\n8. If my opponent chooses paper, we'd tie (0 points).\n\n9.

I notice paper has the highest potential payoff (+3) but also the highest risk (-3 if opponent plays scissors).\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their tendencies or patterns.\n\n4. In such cases of uncertainty, it might be reasonable to go for the option with potential for highest gain.\n\n5. However, I also need to consider that my opponent might be thinking similarly and choose rock (hoping to get the +3 from paper).\n\n6. If they're thinking strategically, they might anticipate me choosing paper and pick scissors to counter.\n\n7. Since rock has a balance of moderate risk (-3 against paper) and potential reward (+1 against scissors), it seems like a reasonable first move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this first round, as it provides protection against scissors while I gather information about my opponent's strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n",

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no previous data to analyze.\n\n3. I need to consider what a typical first-time player might choose:\n   - Studies suggest rock is the most common first move in RPS (around 35-36% of the time)\n   - Beginners tend to choose rock more frequently than other options\n\n4. Given this information, paper would be the optimal counter to the most likely move.\n\n5. Paper also has the highest potential payoff (3 points) if successful, compared to rock or scissors (1 point each).\n\n6. The risk of playing paper is that if the opponent plays scissors, I only lose 1 point, which is less than the 3 points I would lose if I played rock against paper.\n\n7.

Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (3 points), while other winning moves only give 1 point.\n3. Similarly, losing to paper gives the highest penalty (-3 points), while other losing moves only give -1 point.\n4. Against a fresh player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n5. Due to the asymmetric payoffs, paper has a higher expected value than the other moves if all three choices are equally likely to be played by my opponent.\n6. Rock is the most \"punished\" move (losing -3 if opponent plays paper), so I should avoid playing rock.\n7. Between paper and scissors, paper has higher upside (winning 3 vs scissors winning only 1).\n8.

If they switch to rock (perhaps thinking we're cycling through moves), paper would win me 3 points\n\n7. Given that scissors has the lowest potential penalty (-1 if they play rock) compared to the other options, and could win against paper if they switch to that, scissors seems to balance risk and reward best.\n\n8.

My pattern so far: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - I've won the last two rounds by correctly anticipating their moves\n   - I haven't played scissors yet\n\n4. Given my opponent's pattern, they might:\n   - Switch to paper, expecting me to play rock again (cycling through options)\n   - Return to scissors, expecting me to play paper again (countering my last move)\n   - Stick with rock, not expecting me to repeat paper (assuming I won't repeat)\n\n5. The most sophisticated strategy would be for them to switch to paper, as they might assume I'll play rock to counter their potential scissors.\n\n6. If they play paper, my best move would be scissors (+1).\n\n7. If they play rock again, and I play scissors, I lose (-1).\n\n8. If they play scissors, and I play scissors, it's a tie (0).\n\n9. Since they've shown adaptation after consecutive losses, they're likely to change their strategy again.\n\n10. The risk of playing scissors is reasonable - worst case I lose 1 point, but I could gain 1 point and avoid the larger 3-point loss if they've switched to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round to counter their potential switch to paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n",
        "I'll continue my analysis based on the game history and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nSteps:\n\n1.

Looking at my opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: Scissors\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - Round 3: Rock\n   - They switched after losing twice with scissors\n\n3. My opponent seems to be adopting a reactive strategy:\n   - They stuck with scissors after it worked once\n   - They switched to rock after scissors lost\n\n4. Since they just lost with rock, they're likely to switch again.\n\n5. Based on the established pattern, they might play paper next (completing the cycle of scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper).\n\n6. If they play paper, my options would be:\n   - Rock: I would lose (-3 points)\n   - Paper: We would tie (0 points)\n   - Scissors: I would win (+1 point)\n\n7. Playing scissors would be the optimal counter if they indeed switch to paper.\n\n8. However, there's also a chance they might try to be unpredictable and return to scissors:\n   - If they play scissors and I play scissors, it would be a tie (0 points)\n   - This outcome is better than losing with paper (-1 points)\n\n9. Another possibility is they stick with rock despite losing:\n   - If they play rock and I play scissors, I would lose (-1 point)\n   - This is still better than the potential loss from playing rock against their paper (-3)\n\n10. Considering the most probable move (paper) and the relative risks, scissors offers the best expected value.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n",

The opponent has now changed their strategy, switching from scissors to rock after losing twice with scissors.\n\n4. They might continue to adapt their strategy in response to losing. After losing to my paper with their rock, they may:\n   - Switch to scissors (to beat my paper)\n   - Try paper themselves\n   - Return to rock hoping I'll change\n\n5. Considering psychological factors:\n   - Players often don't repeat a move that just lost\n   - They may assume I'll stick with paper after a big win\n   - The logical counter to paper is scissors\n\n6. If they play scissors and I play rock, I win (+1)\n   - This seems most likely given the game flow\n\n7. If they play paper and I play rock, I lose (-3)\n   - This seems less likely as they haven't played paper yet\n\n8. If they play rock again and I play rock, it's a tie (0)\n   - Also less likely as they just lost with rock\n\n9. Given that scissors is the logical counter to my last move (paper), and players often try to counter their opponent's previous successful move, I should anticipate scissors and play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round to counter the anticipated scissors move.\n\n[move] Rock\n",

My opponent's moves have been: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They played scissors twice, then switched to rock\n   - They likely switched because their scissors strategy stopped working\n\n3. My moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - I've won the last two rounds with different moves\n   - My adaptation seems to be working\n\n4. Predicting my opponent's next move:\n   - They might recognize I'm countering their moves\n   - They lost significantly with rock (-3), so they're likely to change\n   - The logical next move for them would be paper (which beats rock)\n   - They might also think I'll play paper again and choose scissors\n\n5. If they play paper:\n   - Rock would lose (-3)\n   - Paper would tie (0)\n   - Scissors would win (+1)\n\n6. If they play scissors (reverting to their earlier preference):\n   - Rock would win (+1)\n   - Paper would lose (-1)\n   - Scissors would tie (0)\n\n7. If they play rock again:\n   - Rock would tie (0)\n   - Paper would win (+3)\n   - Scissors would lose (-1)\n\n8. The most likely scenario is they'll switch to paper or scissors.

Their likely responses:\n   - Switch to scissors (to counter my paper)\n   - Switch to paper (assuming I might play rock to counter their predicted scissors)\n   - Return to rock (if they think I'll overthink and play scissors)\n\n4. The most logical move for them is scissors, assuming I'll play paper again after my successful round.\n\n5.

Given their demonstrated preference for scissors (75% of moves so far), the probability-weighted expected value favors playing rock.\n\n9. Additionally, they may be employing a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy, which would lead them to stay with scissors since they just tied rather than lost.\n\n10.

Rock provides the best expected value against their likely move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round, anticipating they'll stick with scissors for a third time or at least expecting that's the most probable move.\n\n[move] Rock\n",

My opponent seems to have broken their previous patterns by sticking with scissors despite:\n   - A tie in the previous round\n   - Having already played scissors three times consecutively\n\n5. This suggests they might be:\n   - Adopting a new strategy of stubborn repetition\n   - Trying to establish a new pattern to confuse me\n   - Expecting me to overthink and not play rock (the simple counter)\n\n6. After winning with scissors against my paper, they might:\n   - Continue with their scissors streak (since it just worked)\n   - Finally switch to rock (anticipating I'll play scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (to be unpredictable after establishing a pattern)\n\n7. Given their unprecedented streak of scissors and their success with it in the last round, there's a strong possibility they'll continue with scissors.\n\n8. If they play scissors again, rock would be my best counter (+1).\n\n9. If they switch to rock, and I play rock, we tie (0).\n\n10. If they switch to paper, and I play rock, I lose (-3).\n\n11.

Looking at their behavior after wins:\n   - After winning with scissors in round 1, they repeated scissors\n   - After winning with paper in round 6, they repeated paper\n   - This suggests they might repeat a winning move\n\n6. However, they've now played scissors four consecutive times, which is unprecedented in our game.\n\n7. This suggests either:\n   - They've found a pattern they're comfortable with\n   - They're trying to establish a clear pattern before breaking it\n   - They've simplified their strategy to mostly scissors\n\n8.

My current score: +8 - 1 = +7 points after the recent loss.\n\n4. My opponent has continued to break their earlier patterns by:\n   - Playing rock again after a tie (they previously switched after ties)\n   - Establishing a new streak with rock (after their scissors streak)\n\n5. After winning with rock against my scissors, they might:\n   - Continue their rock streak (since it just worked)\n   - Switch to paper (following a pattern of switching after success)\n   - Switch to scissors (to be unpredictable)\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after consecutive wins:\n   - In rounds 6-7, after winning with paper, they played paper again\n   - This suggests they might stick with a winning move\n\n7.

Looking at their recent behavior:\n   - They played rock twice, then switched to scissors\n   - They've won two rounds in a row with different moves (rock then scissors)\n   - They may be developing a counter-strategy to my adaptive approach\n\n8. Considering frequency analysis:\n   - Scissors: 9/17 rounds (53%)\n   - Rock: 6/17 rounds (35%)\n   - Paper: 2/17 rounds (12%)\n   - Their preference for scissors is consistent throughout the game\n\n9.

Looking at their behavior specifically after rock ties:\n   - After our rock tie in round 5, they played paper in round 6\n   - After our rock tie in round 15, they played rock again in round 16\n   - This shows inconsistency in their response to rock ties\n\n6. However, their general pattern after ties is to switch to what would have beaten their previous move:\n   - Following this pattern, they might play paper (which would have beaten rock)\n\n7. My recent experience suggests they've become more unpredictable, potentially adapting to counter my strategy.\n\n8.

Looking at their most recent patterns:\n   - They went from two rocks (rounds 15-16) to scissors (round 17) to rock (round 18)\n   - This suggests potential alternating between rock and scissors\n\n7. If they follow an alternating pattern, they might play scissors next.\n\n8. If they play scissors as predicted, rock would be my best counter (+1).\n\n9. If they switch to paper (as they did after our first rock tie), and I play rock, I lose (-3).\n\n10. If they stick with rock again, and I play rock, we tie (0).\n\n11.

Given their overwhelming preference for scissors (10/19 moves) and their recent success with it, rock seems like the safest choice to counter their most likely move.\n\n11.

They've now played scissors in 4 of the last 6 rounds despite mixed results, suggesting a strong preference.\n\n7. If they switch to rock as a counter to my rock, paper would be my best response (+3).\n\n8. If they switch to paper to beat my rock, scissors would be my best response (+1).\n\n9. If they stubbornly stick with scissors, rock would continue to be effective (+1).\n\n10. Since they've mostly alternated between scissors and rock recently, with a stronger preference for scissors, they might switch to rock after just losing with scissors.\n\n11. Given their historical pattern of often switching after a loss and their second-most common move being rock, they're likely to play rock next.\n\n12. Playing paper would:\n    - Beat their rock if they switch to it (+3)\n    - Lose to scissors if they stick with it (-1)\n    - Tie against paper if they surprise with it (0)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round, anticipating they'll switch to rock based on their typical behavior after losses and their established move preferences.\n\n[move] Paper\n",

Key observations:\n   - I just broke my losing streak with rock against their scissors\n   - My opponent has played scissors in their last two moves\n   - Their preference for scissors remains very strong (11/20 moves)\n   - They've played scissors after I played rock several times (rounds 9-10, 12-13, now 20-?)\n\n5. After losing with scissors against my rock, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (to counter potential repeated rock)\n   - Continue with scissors (maintaining their strong preference)\n   - Switch to paper (to try to surprise me)\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after losing:\n   - After losing with scissors in round 2, they played rock\n   - After losing with rock in round 3, they played scissors\n   - After losing with paper in round 7, they played rock\n   - After losing with scissors in round 9, they played scissors again\n   - After losing with scissors in round 12, they played scissors again\n   - Their response to losing is not consistent\n\n7. However, they have a pattern of sticking with scissors even after losing with it (after rounds 9 and 12).\n\n8. Given that they've played scissors in 4 of the last 5 rounds and have shown a tendency to repeat scissors even after losses, there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors again.\n\n9. If they play scissors again, rock would be my best counter (+1).\n\n10. If they switch to rock, and I play rock, we tie (0).\n\n11. If they switch to paper, and I play rock, I lose (-3).\n\n12. Given their strong historical preference for scissors and their demonstrated willingness to repeat scissors after losses, rock remains the most strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again this round, anticipating they'll continue with scissors based on their overwhelming preference for this move and historical pattern of scissors repetition.\n\n[move] Rock\n",

Paper is clearly not working against this opponent, as they've repeatedly countered it with scissors. I've lost with paper in rounds 1, 14, 17, 19, and now 21.\n\n6.

If they switch to rock as predicted, paper would be my best response (+3).\n\n9. If they switch to paper, and I play paper, we tie (0).\n\n10. If they stubbornly stick with scissors, and I play paper, I lose (-1).\n\n11. This is a critical decision point - they must realize their scissors strategy is failing against my rock, and the logical counter would be for them to switch to rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round, anticipating they'll finally switch to rock after their scissors strategy has repeatedly failed against my rock moves.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
