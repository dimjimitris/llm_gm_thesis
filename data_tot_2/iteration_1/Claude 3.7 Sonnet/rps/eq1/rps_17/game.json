Since this is our first interaction, I don't have any information about their play pattern.\n3. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, without prior information, no single move has a theoretical advantage.\n4. However, studies have shown that rock is often the most common first move people make instinctively.\n5. If my opponent follows this tendency, paper would be the optimal counter.\n6. Alternatively, I could choose randomly for this first round and then adapt based on their pattern in subsequent rounds.\n7. Given the limited information, I'll go with paper as my strategic first move to counter the potential rock opening.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Players often shift their strategy after a tie.

Since they played paper last time, they might reason that I'll either play paper again or switch to scissors expecting them to play paper again.\n6. If they anticipate I'll play paper again, they might switch to scissors.\n7. If they anticipate I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock.\n8.

They might be thinking that I've noticed their pattern and will anticipate scissors, which would lead them to play rock instead.\n9. However, if they're not thinking that deeply, they might just follow their alternating pattern and play scissors.\n10.

They might analyze that I've been perfectly countering their moves and attempt to predict and counter my next move.\n20.

To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"
