Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Some research suggests that in the first round, inexperienced players tend to choose rock slightly more often, but this is not a strong enough effect to base my strategy on.\n\n5. I could try to be unpredictable by using a random selection, but I'll choose paper for this first round as a balanced opening move.\n\n6.

My best move is to play rock, which would beat scissors if they continue with the same move.\n\n6.

Let's review our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n\n2. Through twenty-two complete rounds, my opponent has maintained their perfect cycling pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 repeat. We're now starting the eighth cycle of this pattern.\n\n3. I've now won twenty consecutive rounds by correctly predicting their moves.\n\n4. Following their established pattern, their next move will be rock.\n\n5. The optimal counter to rock is paper.\n\n6. After twenty-two rounds with perfect adherence to their pattern despite consistently losing, it's essentially certain they will continue with the same sequence.\n\n7. I will continue exploiting their rigid pattern with the perfect counter-move.\n\n[move] paper\n"
