The standard game theory approach suggests random selection for the first move.\n4. However, psychological research suggests that rock is often the most common first move people make.\n5. If I assume my opponent might choose rock, paper would be the optimal counter.\n6. But my opponent might be thinking along the same lines and choose paper, in which case scissors would be best.\n7. Given this circular reasoning, I should make a strategic choice while understanding any first move has equal theoretical merit.\n8.

Their last move switching to paper was strategic - they seem to be anticipating my choices effectively\n\n5. There are two main possibilities for their strategy:\n   - They could be using a predetermined pattern that happens to work well against me\n   - They could be actively predicting my next move based on game history and psychology\n\n6. Given their success rate, the second option seems more likely\n\n7. If they're predicting my moves, they might expect:\n   - After losing with rock against paper, I'm likely to switch to scissors to beat their paper\n   - If they anticipate scissors from me, they would play rock\n\n8. Another possibility is they're using a complex rotation:\n   - Their last two moves were scissors \u2192 paper\n   - Following RPS rotation, rock would come next\n\n9. Both analyses suggest they might play rock next\n\n10. If I expect them to play rock:\n    - I should play paper to beat it\n    - However, if they're truly anticipating my moves, they might expect this and play scissors\n    - This creates a complex prediction problem\n\n11. Given their pattern of successfully countering my moves, I need to break predictability\n    - I've never played the same move three times in a row\n    - Playing scissors would be unexpected and would beat paper if they repeat their last move\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Opponent's full sequence: scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\n   - My cumulative score is now -5, with 7 losses, 3 ties, and only 2 wins\n\n3. Looking at the most recent sequence:\n   - In rounds 10-11-12, their moves were scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\n   - This forms a perfect RPS rotation in reverse (scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, rock beats scissors)\n\n4. Broader pattern analysis:\n   - They seem to be mixing strategies\n   - Sometimes they follow patterns (like the even-round rock pattern early on)\n   - Other times they seem to directly counter my anticipated moves\n   - They've played rock 5 times, scissors 5 times, and paper twice\n\n5. If they're following the reverse RPS rotation they just completed, they would play scissors next\n\n6. However, they might also be adaptively countering what they think I'll play next:\n   - After losing with scissors against rock, I might be expected to play rock or paper\n   - If they think I'll play rock, they'd play paper\n   - If they think I'll play paper, they'd play scissors\n\n7. Given their success rate, I need to consider what they would least expect:\n   - I've lost the last three rounds with paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\n   - I've never played the same move twice in a row\n   - Playing paper again would break my own pattern of avoiding repetition\n\n8. Considering all factors:\n   - If they follow their reverse rotation: scissors would tie\n   - If they anticipate I'll play rock next: paper would lose\n   - If they anticipate I'll try something unexpected: unpredictable\n\n9. Since they've been so successful at anticipating my moves, my best strategy might be maximum unpredictability\n   - Repeatedly losing suggests they have identified patterns in my decision-making\n   - Breaking all apparent patterns is my best defense\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Their last three moves have been paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\n   - This completes one full cycle of all three moves\n\n4. Psychological analysis:\n   - The opponent seems to be extremely good at anticipating my choices\n   - They may be analyzing my thinking patterns or using some algorithmic approach\n   - I need to be less predictable and avoid any detectable patterns in my play\n\n5. Strategy reassessment:\n   - Traditional pattern recognition is failing me as the opponent is consistently one step ahead\n   - Since they've just played scissors, standard RPS thinking suggests they might expect me to play rock next\n   - If they expect rock from me, they would play paper\n\n6. Alternative approach:\n   - Since trying to outthink the opponent has failed, I could try an extremely simple strategy\n   - Playing the move that would have won the previous round is a basic but sometimes effective approach\n   - In the last round, rock would have beaten their scissors\n\n7. Another consideration:\n   - The opponent has played scissors most frequently (6/13 rounds)\n   - Playing rock has the highest expected value against their historical distribution\n\n8. Weighing all factors:\n   - Given their apparent ability to predict complex thinking, a simpler approach might be more effective\n   - Rock would beat their most common historical move (scissors)\n   - Rock would have won the previous round\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - The even-round rock pattern has reasserted itself in rounds 12 and 14\n   - In odd-numbered rounds, they've played scissors 5 times and paper 2 times\n   - This round (15) is odd-numbered, suggesting scissors is more likely based on this pattern\n\n4.

Evaluating the two most likely possibilities:\n   - If they follow their even-round rock pattern: paper would win\n   - If they follow a natural RPS rotation after paper: scissors would lose\n\n6.

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Even rounds: Rock pattern (7/9) was broken in round 18 with paper\n   - Odd rounds: Recent trend toward paper (4/9) rather than scissors (5/9)\n   - Their last three moves were paper\u2192paper\u2192paper in rounds 15, 17, 18\n\n4. There appears to be a significant shift in their strategy:\n   - They seem to be moving away from their earlier patterns\n   - Playing paper three times in a row suggests either:\n     a) They're using a new pattern\n     b) They're adapting to counter my perceived strategy\n     c) They're introducing randomness to be less predictable\n\n5. For round 19 (odd):\n   - Given they've played paper three times in a row, they might:\n     a) Continue with paper (establishing a new pattern)\n     b) Switch to a different move (breaking the paper streak)\n\n6. If they're establishing a paper pattern, I should play scissors\n7. If they're breaking the paper streak, they'll play either rock or scissors\n   - Rock would beat my scissors\n   - Scissors would tie with my scissors\n\n8. Psychological consideration: After three papers in a row, continuing with paper becomes psychologically difficult\n   - Most players feel compelled to change after three repetitions\n   - This suggests they're more likely to break their paper streak\n\n9. Weighing the evidence:\n   - The opponent has shown adaptability\n   - Three papers in a row suggests a likely switch\n   - Scissors would beat paper if they continue the streak\n   - Scissors would tie with scissors if they choose that\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Their three-paper streak ended with a return to rock\n   - They broke from their paper streak exactly when I played scissors to counter it\n   - This suggests they might be actively predicting my moves rather than following a fixed pattern\n\n4. Looking at recent rounds:\n   - Rounds 15-19: paper\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192paper\u2192rock\n   - They seem to be alternating between paper and rock recently, with the paper streak being an exception\n\n5. Round 20 is even-numbered:\n   - Their historical pattern for even rounds was strongly rock (7/9 even rounds)\n   - But they've become less predictable in recent rounds\n   - If they continue the recent paper/rock alternation after rock, they might play paper\n\n6. Psychological considerations:\n   - After successfully countering my scissors with rock, they might anticipate I'll switch to rock\n   - If they expect rock from me, they would play paper\n   - This would also align with the paper/rock alternation they've shown recently\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play paper: rock loses\n   - If they play rock: rock ties\n   - If they play scissors: rock wins\n\n8. Weighing all factors:\n   - Their successful countering of my moves suggests they're anticipating my choices\n   - The recent alternating pattern suggests paper is more likely than rock\n   - Paper has been increasingly frequent in their recent plays (5 of last 10 moves)\n\n9. To counter their likely paper play, I should choose scissors\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at when I lost vs. when I tied/won:\n    - I lost in rounds 1, 5, 6, and 7\n    - I tied in rounds 2 and 3\n    - I won only in round 4 with paper against rock\n\n11. The opponent seems to be predicting my moves effectively, possibly by identifying patterns in my play or using counter-strategies\n\n12. At this point, random play might be better than trying to find patterns that could be exploited\n\n13. However, rock has been their most common play (3/7 rounds) and they just played scissors\n    - If they have a tendency to switch moves after winning, they might move from scissors to something else\n    - Rock would be effective against their potential scissors repeat\n    - Rock would also tie against another rock if they return to their most common move\n\n14. Given my negative record, I'll choose rock as it has slightly better expected value against their historical moves\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n",

However, they might also be directly countering my moves:\n   - In the last 4 rounds, they've beaten me 3 times and tied once\n   - This suggests they might be predicting my choices successfully\n\n12. Breaking my own patterns:\n   - I've played each move at least twice now but without a clear pattern\n   - My opponent might be using my previous move to predict my next one\n\n13. To counter their potential paper (if they follow the RPS sequence), scissors would be best\n   - If they expect me to play scissors and counter with rock, I would lose\n   - If they play paper following their sequence, I would win\n   - If they play scissors again, we would tie\n\n14.

Another observation is that we've tied 3 times when:\n    - Round 2: Both played rock\n    - Round 3: Both played scissors\n    - Round 8: Both played rock\n    - This suggests they might be able to anticipate certain moves of mine\n\n12.

Given they've played scissors twice in a row and have used scissors most frequently overall, I think the most likely scenario is that they'll switch away from scissors\n\n15.

Considering all factors, scissors seems like the least predictable choice at this point:\n   - Wins against paper if they repeat their last move\n   - Ties against rock if they're anticipating scissors\n   - Loses to scissors, but they've rarely played scissors twice in a row\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My cumulative score is now -5, which indicates they have an extremely effective strategy against mine\n\n4. Looking at recent opponent moves:\n   - They've played scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock in the last four rounds\n   - This doesn't follow a simple pattern, suggesting they're actively adapting\n\n5. I'm now convinced they're successfully predicting my moves and countering them, rather than following a fixed pattern themselves\n\n6. Traditional game theory suggests that in RPS, the optimal strategy against a superior predictor is to choose randomly\n\n7. However, true randomness is difficult to achieve through human reasoning\n\n8. One approach is to use an \"anchor\" - something unrelated to the game - to make my choice\n   - For example, I could base my move on the number of rounds played\n   - Round 13 is coming up, and 13 modulo 3 = 1\n   - If I assign 1=rock, 2=paper, 3=scissors, then I should play rock\n\n9. Another approach is to note that I've lost the last three rounds playing all three different moves\n   - This could mean the opponent has truly figured out my thinking process\n   - Breaking that process completely might be the best approach\n\n10. Since the opponent just played rock, they might:\n    - Play paper next (following a potential rotation)\n    - Play rock again (since it just won)\n    - Play scissors (to mix things up)\n\n11. Without a clear pattern to exploit, and with strong evidence they can predict my strategic thinking, I'll use the numerical anchor approach\n\nFinal decision: Using the round number as an anchor (13 mod 3 = 1 = rock), I will choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n",

Analyzing my own moves:\n   - I've played paper (3 times), rock (5 times), scissors (4 times)\n   - My last three moves were rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - I've lost 8 rounds, won 2, and tied 2\n\n5. Potential strategies for this round:\n   - Their last three moves were scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - If they're following a rotation pattern, scissors might come next\n   - If they're anticipating my move, they'll try to counter whatever they think I'll play\n\n6.

Breaking the pattern completely:\n   - Their recent pattern suggests they might play scissors next\n   - To beat scissors, I should play rock\n   - However, they've consistently outpredicted me, so they might anticipate this and play paper\n\n9.

They've just completed a full cycle of scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock in the last three rounds\n   - If they're following this rotation, they would play scissors next\n\n7.

Strategy reassessment:\n   - Traditional pattern recognition is failing me as the opponent is consistently one step ahead\n   - Since they've just played scissors, standard RPS thinking suggests they might expect me to play rock next\n   - If they expect rock from me, they would play paper\n\n6. Alternative approach:\n   - Since trying to outthink the opponent has failed, I could try an extremely simple strategy\n   - Playing the move that would have won the previous round is a basic but sometimes effective approach\n   - In the last round, rock would have beaten their scissors\n\n7. Another consideration:\n   - The opponent has played scissors most frequently (6/13 rounds)\n   - Playing rock has the highest expected value against their historical distribution\n\n8.

Pattern observations:\n   - The opponent has played rock in even-numbered rounds (2,4,6,8,14) with only one exception (round 10)\n   - They've just played rock in round 14, so for round 15 (odd), they would likely play scissors based on their odd-round tendency\n   - Their full sequence shows they often alternate between rock and scissors\n\n4. Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Their last three moves have been scissors\u2192rock\u2192rock\n   - This is the first time they've repeated the same move consecutively\n   - This could indicate they're changing their strategy or responding adaptively\n\n5. If they follow their historical odd-round pattern, they'll play scissors in round 15\n\n6. If they're using adaptive countering:\n   - After a tie with rock-rock, they might expect me to switch to paper\n   - If they anticipate paper from me, they would play scissors\n\n7.

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Even rounds (2,4,6,8,12,14): They've consistently played rock (except round 10)\n   - Odd rounds: They've played scissors in rounds 1,3,7,9,13 and paper in rounds 5,11,15\n   - There may be a secondary pattern in odd rounds: paper every 5th odd round (5,11,15)\n\n4. Looking at the most recent rounds:\n   - Their last move was paper in round 15\n   - In round 16 (even), the established pattern suggests they'll play rock\n   - After playing paper, many players follow with scissors in the RPS rotation\n\n5. Evaluating the two most likely possibilities:\n   - If they follow their even-round rock pattern: paper would win\n   - If they follow a natural RPS rotation after paper: scissors would lose\n\n6. The even-round rock pattern has been remarkably consistent (6/7 even rounds)\n\n7. However, given their success rate, they might anticipate I've detected this pattern\n   - If they think I'll play paper to beat their expected rock, they might play scissors\n   - This creates the classic RPS prediction problem\n\n8. Weighing the evidence:\n   - Their established pattern is very strong for rock in even rounds\n   - They've only broken this pattern once (round 10)\n   - The risk of overthinking and self-defeating is high in this situation\n\n9. Given the strength of the even-round pattern, I will take the most straightforward approach and play paper\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n",

Pattern observations:\n   - They've broken the odd-round scissors pattern I previously identified\n   - Their paper plays are increasing in frequency (now 3/15 rounds)\n   - They seem to be mixing strategies to remain unpredictable\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - I've played rock in rounds 14 and 15\n   - I've never played the same move three times in a row\n   - Based on my own pattern, I would be expected to switch\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - The opponent just played paper, so scissors would beat it\n   - However, they might anticipate this obvious counter and play rock\n   - Given their success rate, they seem to be anticipating my thought process effectively\n\n6. Alternative approach:\n   - Since standard pattern recognition and countering strategies have failed, I might need a completely different approach\n   - The opponent might be expecting me to overthink this\n   - A simple, direct response might be unexpected\n\n7. This round (16) is even-numbered, and their even-round rock pattern has been quite strong (5/7 even rounds)\n   - If they continue this pattern, paper would be optimal\n   - If they break this pattern, it's harder to predict, but scissors has the highest expected value against their overall distribution\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Pattern reassessment:\n   - The even-round rock pattern still holds (7/8 even rounds)\n   - The odd-round pattern has shifted - they've played paper in 3 of the last 4 odd rounds\n   - They've now played paper in rounds 5,11,15,17\n\n4. Recent behavior analysis:\n   - They played rock in round 16 (even), maintaining that pattern\n   - They played paper in rounds 15 and 17, breaking their previous odd-round tendency for scissors\n   - This might indicate a new pattern or adaptation\n\n5. For round 18 (even):\n   - The even-round rock pattern has been extremely consistent\n   - 7 out of 8 even rounds have been rock\n   - Only round 10 broke this pattern\n   - This suggests rock is highly probable for round 18\n\n6. Strategic approach:\n   - Given the strength of the even-round rock pattern, paper would be the optimal counter\n   - Even though they might anticipate this, the pattern has been so consistent it's worth playing to\n\n7.

For this round (18):\n   - If they continue the recent alternating pattern, they would play rock\n   - If they follow their historical even-round tendency, they would play rock\n   - Both analyses point to rock as their most likely move\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - To beat an anticipated rock move, I should play paper\n   - However, they might expect this reasoning and play scissors instead\n   - Given their success rate, I need to consider they may be one step ahead\n\n7.

Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent breaking two of their established patterns in the last round is significant\n   - Their even-round rock pattern held for 7/8 rounds before this exception\n   - They've now played paper twice in a row, possibly indicating a new strategy\n\n4. For round 19 (odd):\n   - After playing paper twice, they might continue with paper or switch\n   - If they're using standard RPS psychology, they might expect me to play scissors to beat their paper\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they would play rock\n\n5. Considering their odd-round tendencies:\n   - Earlier odd rounds favored scissors (rounds 1,3,7,9,13)\n   - More recent odd rounds have favored paper (rounds 11,15,17)\n   - Both patterns suggest they wouldn't play scissors in round 19\n\n6.

If I expect rock, my best response is paper\n   - However, they just played paper twice\n   - Playing paper would mean I'm expecting them to break their recent paper streak\n   - But it would also mean I'm expecting them to follow their earlier odd-round patterns\n\n8. Since they've just broken two established patterns, this suggests they're shifting strategy\n   - The safest move against their possible rock or continued paper would be scissors\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Even rounds: They've played rock in 7/9 even rounds, paper in 1/9, scissors in 1/9\n   - Odd rounds: They've played paper in 4/9 odd rounds, scissors in 5/9 odd rounds\n   - They've now played paper twice in a row (rounds 17 and 18)\n   - This is the first time they've repeated the same move in consecutive rounds\n\n4. This significant break in pattern suggests a possible shift in their strategy:\n   - Breaking the even-round rock pattern\n   - Playing paper in consecutive rounds\n   - Perhaps they've detected that I've identified their patterns\n\n5. For round 19 (odd):\n   - Historically, they've played scissors (5/9) or paper (4/9) in odd rounds\n   - After playing paper twice, they might:\n     a) Continue with paper a third time\n     b) Return to their odd-round tendency for scissors\n     c) Play rock to complete all three moves\n\n6. Psychological analysis:\n   - After two papers in a row, they might expect me to play scissors\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they would play rock\n\n7. Weighing all factors:\n   - Their break in pattern suggests they're becoming less predictable\n   - Rock seems most likely based on psychological analysis\n   - Rock would beat their previous tendency for scissors in odd rounds\n   - Rock would lose to their recent tendency for paper\n\n8. Given the significant pattern break and resulting uncertainty, scissors offers the best coverage:\n   - Beats paper if they play it a third time or return to their odd-round paper tendency\n   - Loses to rock if they make that choice\n   - Given their recent plays, paper seems more likely than rock\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - After their unusual streak of papers, they reverted to rock\n   - They may be cycling through different \"streak\" patterns\n   - Even rounds: Rock has been played in 7/9 even rounds\n   - Round 20 is even, which historically suggests rock is likely\n\n4.

Weighing all factors:\n   - Their high frequency of paper recently suggests they might continue with it\n   - They may be expecting me to switch to scissors after losing to paper\n   - Paper would counter their anticipated rock play\n   - Given their paper-heavy recent strategy, scissors seems most likely to succeed\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n",
