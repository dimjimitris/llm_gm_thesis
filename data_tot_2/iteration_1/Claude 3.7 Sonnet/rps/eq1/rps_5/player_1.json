Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors without prior knowledge, no single move has a theoretical advantage.\n3. However, psychological research suggests that rock is often the most common first move choice among players.\n4. If my opponent plays rock (which is statistically more likely), paper would be the optimal counter.\n5. Scissors would be risky as it loses to the common first-move choice of rock.\n6. Paper has a reasonable chance of winning (if they play rock) or tying (if they also play paper).\n7.

Round 23: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost).\n5. My opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n6. They've now played paper twice in a row, which is unusual given their previous tendencies.\n7. This suggests they might be adapting their strategy or have identified a pattern in my play.\n8. After winning with paper against my rock, they could:\n   - Continue with paper since it's been successful\n   - Anticipate I'll play scissors to counter their paper, so they'll play rock\n   - Switch to scissors expecting me to play paper (which would counter their paper)\n9. Given their adaptability, they seem to be anticipating my moves effectively.\n10. Looking at our longer history, they've often made moves that counter what I might logically play next.\n11. Since they've won with paper, and I've lost twice in a row, they might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper.\n12. If they expect scissors from me, they would play rock.\n13. To counter their likely rock play, paper would be my optimal choice.\n14. However, they might also be thinking multiple levels ahead and stick with paper or switch to scissors.\n15. Given their recent success with paper and my need to break this losing streak, scissors seems like the best strategic choice - it would beat their paper if they continue with it, and at worst lose to rock if they switch.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this twenty-fourth round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
