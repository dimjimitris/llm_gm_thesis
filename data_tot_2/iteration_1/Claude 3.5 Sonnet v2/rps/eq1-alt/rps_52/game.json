Critical error analysis:\n   - I misinterpreted their last move\n   - I fell into a trap by assuming pattern continuation\n   - They're showing sophisticated mix of persistence and changes\n\n3. Opponent style assessment:\n   - First showed long-term rock commitment\n   - Then switched to paper\n   - Now using rock again\n   - They're proving highly adaptable\n\n4. Psychological dynamics:\n   - They've successfully disrupted my ability to predict\n   - They're alternating between commitment and changes\n   - They might expect me to be confused and cautious\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - They've used rock most recently\n   - After successful moves, they often maintain them\n   - However, they might expect me to play paper against their rock\n   - A rock vs rock tie is preferable to being caught in another trap\n   - Playing conservatively while I rebuild my read on their strategy\n\n[move] rock Taking a conservative approach with potential for tie while rebuilding strategic read\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
