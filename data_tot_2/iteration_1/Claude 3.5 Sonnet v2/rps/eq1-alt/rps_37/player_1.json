    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer: Specialist in identifying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager: Expert in evaluating risk-reward scenarios\n\nLet's collaborate!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In such cases, it's best to start with a balanced approach. We should avoid being too predictable from the start.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move, we can't analyze any patterns yet. However, many players tend to choose 'rock' as their first move as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. We could potentially exploit this tendency.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's consider the payoff matrix. Each move has equal risk (-1) and reward (+1) potential. Since we're playing against a fresh player, we should focus on maximizing our expected value while maintaining unpredictability.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the analysis, I suggest playing 'paper' as our first move. If our opponent plays the common 'rock' opening, we win. If they play 'scissors', we lose, and if they play 'paper', we tie. This gives us a reasonable expected value.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree with this approach. We can then adjust our strategy based on the opponent's first move in subsequent rounds.\n\nRisk Manager: The 'paper' strategy provides a good balance of risk and reward for an opening move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the collective analysis.

Given that they won with rock in the first round, there's a psychological tendency for players to either:\n1. Stick with what worked (continue with rock)\n2. Anticipate our adaptation and switch to paper to counter our expected rock\n\nGame Strategist: This is a critical moment. The opponent has shown they're willing to use rock in an opening move. We need to consider the psychological impact of their win and how it might influence their next decision. The key is to stay one step ahead of their thinking.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that they won with rock, they might feel confident and stick with it. However, if they're a strategic player, they might anticipate us switching to paper and thus choose scissors. We need to balance these possibilities.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at the immediate history and common player psychology, I believe they're more likely to switch their move. Players often don't like to be predictable after a successful move, as they expect their opponent to adapt.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing scissors this round. Here's why:\n1. If they switch to paper (expecting us to play rock), we win\n2. If they stick with rock, we lose\n3. If they play scissors, we tie\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with this analysis.

Let's look at the sequence:\nRound 1: They played rock, we played paper (we lost)\nRound 2: They played scissors, we played scissors (tie)\nThere's a pattern emerging - they've moved from rock to scissors, showing a clockwise movement in the game choices (rock \u2192 scissors). If they continue this pattern, paper would be next.\n\nGame Strategist: The tie in the last round creates an interesting psychological dynamic. After a tie, players often try to \"break the deadlock\" by making a decisive move. Given that both players chose scissors, there might be a tendency to try to counter scissors by playing rock.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the potential scenarios:\n1. If they follow their clockwise pattern and play paper, rock would win\n2. If they try to break the tie by anticipating our rock and play paper, rock would lose\n3. If they stay with scissors expecting us to switch, rock would win\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've shown strategic thinking (moving from rock to scissors), they might anticipate us playing rock to beat their previous scissors. In this case, they might play paper to beat our expected rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: However, the initial pattern of clockwise movement (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 potentially paper) seems more reliable than complex mind games at this stage.\n\nRisk Manager: Given all factors, I suggest playing rock.

If this pattern holds, they should play rock next.\n\nGame Strategist: However, we need to consider that they've just lost a round. Players often change their strategy after a loss, especially if their pattern has been exposed. They might abandon their clockwise pattern now that it has led to a defeat.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's evaluate our options:\n1. If they continue their pattern and play rock, paper would win\n2. If they break pattern and play scissors (to beat expected paper), we'd lose\n3. If they play paper again (doubling back), rock would win\n\nGame Strategist: The psychological aspect is crucial here. They've just lost, and they might realize we've caught onto their pattern. This could lead to them trying to be unpredictable, possibly by breaking their pattern entirely.\n\nPattern Analyzer: When players realize their pattern has been detected, they often overcompensate by doing something completely different. The safest assumption might be that they will NOT play rock (their pattern move) and instead try to surprise us.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, I recommend playing rock again. Here's why:\n1. It beats scissors (which they might play to counter our expected paper)\n2. If they double down on paper (their last move), we still win\n3.

They've now used scissors twice, winning with it in the latest round.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial moment. They've just won with scissors, but more importantly, they've shown they can break patterns and adapt. We need to consider that they're playing at a sophisticated level.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the current situation:\n1. After winning with scissors, they might:\n   - Feel confident and use scissors again\n   - Expect us to counter scissors with rock, so they might play paper\n   - Try to stay unpredictable by playing rock\n2. Their most used move so far is scissors (2 times)\n\nGame Strategist: When players win with a move, there's often a psychological reluctance to immediately repeat it, as they expect their opponent to counter it. However, some players might double down on a winning move to show dominance.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The fact that they broke their initial pattern suggests they're adaptive and strategic. They might be trying to establish a new pattern or deliberately avoiding patterns altogether.\n\nRisk Manager: Given these factors, I recommend playing paper. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they play rock (trying to be unpredictable), we win\n2. If they play scissors again (doubling down), we lose\n3.

They're demonstrating sophisticated play by:\n1. Breaking patterns when detected\n2. Using unpredictable sequences\n3. Successfully adapting to our moves\n4. Winning with different moves\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze their recent behavior and potential next moves:\n1. They just won with rock, following a win with scissors\n2. They haven't used paper since Round 3\n3. They've used rock twice (Round 1 and 5), scissors twice (Round 2 and 4), and paper once (Round 3)\n\nPattern Analyzer: One subtle pattern is that they haven't used the same move twice in a row yet. After winning with rock, they might avoid using it again immediately.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated ability to outthink us, we need to focus on probability rather than trying to predict their exact move. Since they've used paper the least (only once), it's statistically more likely they might use it now.\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend playing scissors for the following reasons:\n1. It beats paper (their least used move)\n2. They haven't repeated moves consecutively so far, making rock less likely\n3. If they play scissors, we tie rather than lose\n4.

Create patterns when we don't expect them\nThis suggests they might be using a counter-strategy to our analytical approach.\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, we need to break out of the predictable pattern. Since they've been able to match us consistently, we should try something unexpected. Though they used scissors most frequently, they might expect us to use rock to counter their scissors preference.\n\nRisk Manager: I suggest playing paper for these reasons:\n1. It's their least used move (only 2 times)\n2. After so many ties, they might expect us to play rock (the traditional counter to scissors)\n3. If they play rock (expecting our scissors), we win\n4. If they play scissors again (continuing their most frequent choice), we lose\n5. If they play paper (matching us again), we tie\n\nAll Personas: Given the opponent's demonstrated ability to match our moves, we need to break the pattern with an unexpected choice. Paper represents our best chance to break this tie sequence.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Agreed. Let's go with paper to break this pattern.\n\n[move] paper\n"

If they switch to paper (their least used move), we lose\n2. If they play scissors again (unlikely after a loss), we win\n3. If they play rock (being defensive), we tie\n4. Given their tendency to avoid moves they just lost with, and their possible desire to regroup, they're more likely to play rock as a safe choice or paper as an unexpected move\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their recent behavior suggests they're moving away from their earlier sophisticated strategy and might be making more emotionally driven decisions. After consecutive losses with the same move, players typically switch to a different move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on the analysis, particularly their likely avoidance of scissors after losing with it and potential desire for a safer play, let's go with rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"
