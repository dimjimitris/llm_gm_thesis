    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk/reward of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, for a one-shot game with no prior history against a fresh opponent, there's no established pattern to exploit. The classic \"rock, paper, scissors\" is a zero-sum game where each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or drawing.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any behavioral patterns to analyze. The opponent has no preconceptions about our strategy either.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given equal win/loss payoffs (+1/-1) and no prior information, we should focus on a balanced approach. Any move has equal expected value mathematically. However, in human psychology, \"rock\" is often a common first move for many players, as it represents strength.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that insight, we could consider playing \"paper\" to potentially counter a \"rock\" first move. However, we should be aware that sophisticated players might anticipate this and play \"scissors.\"\n\nBehavioral Analyst: I agree with playing paper. Even if we don't win, it will give us information about the opponent's thinking style for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper A strategic first move that could counter the common opening \"rock\" play while gathering information about opponent behavior.\n"

For now, we should treat this as a fresh start but remain alert for any unusual patterns.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the previous game's abnormal ending, we might want to play more conservatively. When facing uncertainty, it's often best to choose a balanced approach.\n\nGame Strategist: In rock-paper-scissors, \"scissors\" is statistically played less frequently as a first move compared to rock or paper. This could give us a slight edge in playing \"rock\" as our opening move.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: I agree. \"Rock\" is also psychologically perceived as stable and strong, which feels appropriate given the previous game's instability.\n\nRisk Analyst: Playing \"rock\" also protects us against the most common aggressive opening move (scissors), while only being vulnerable to paper, which is a more defensive choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock A stable opening move that protects against aggressive plays while maintaining a balanced position.\n"

Most players would assume that after both playing rock, there will be a change in strategy. The question is: how many levels deep does our opponent think?\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the common behaviors after a tie:\n1. Stay with the same move (less common)\n2. Move to what would have beaten the previous move (paper in this case)\n3. Move to what would have lost to the previous move (scissors in this case)\n\nGame Strategist: The most sophisticated play would be to predict that the opponent will play paper (to beat our previous rock), and therefore play scissors to counter that. However, this assumes our opponent is thinking at that level.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Given that they played rock last time, which is a common opening move, we might be dealing with a relatively straightforward player. They're more likely to switch to paper, following the simple logic of \"what would have won last time?\"\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. Let's play scissors, anticipating their likely shift to paper.

They might be actively trying to force ties\n3. They could be using a similar algorithm or decision process\n\nRisk Analyst: After two ties, players often feel increased pressure to \"break the cycle.\" This psychological pressure might influence both players to make more dramatic strategy shifts.\n\nGame Strategist: Given two consecutive ties with synchronized moves, we should consider whether our opponent is:\na) Likely to continue this pattern\nb) Aware of the pattern and planning to break it\nc) Using a sophisticated strategy that happens to align with ours\n\nBehavioral Analyst: After scissors, many players instinctively move to rock, as it feels like a strong counter to the previous move. However, if our opponent is thinking similarly to us, they might make the same prediction.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we break the potential pattern by playing paper. Here's why:\n1. If they play rock (common after scissors), we win\n2. If they try to be clever and play scissors again, we lose, but it's less likely\n3. If they play paper, we tie and gain more information about their strategy\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with paper.

This could even be a mirror match against another AI using similar logic\n\nBehavioral Analyst: The pattern is too consistent to ignore. We've gone through all three moves in a seemingly logical progression, and our opponent has matched each one. This suggests they're either:\n- Reading our strategy extremely well\n- Following the same strategic thinking path\n- Deliberately creating ties\n\nRisk Analyst: This is a critical moment. Breaking this pattern becomes our primary objective, but we need to do it in a way that maximizes our winning probability.\n\nGame Strategist: After completing a full cycle (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper), traditional game theory would suggest randomization. However, if our opponent is truly mirroring us or using similar logic, we need to break from conventional wisdom.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Most players would expect scissors here to counter the paper play.

A sophisticated opponent who has perfectly predicted our logic each time\n\nBehavioral Analyst: The consistent mirroring suggests we need to fundamentally change our approach. Our current strategic thinking, no matter how sophisticated, is being perfectly matched. We need to introduce true randomness rather than calculated decisions.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. Our logical deductions, while sound, are being perfectly anticipated or matched. We need to break free from our pattern of trying to out-think the opponent.\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, the most logical move is to be deliberately illogical. Instead of trying to find the optimal strategic choice, we should make a truly random selection.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let me simulate a random choice:\n*virtual coin flips*\nFirst flip (for scissors vs others): Heads\nSecond flip (between remaining two): Tails\nThis gives us scissors.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Using true randomness might be our best chance to break this mirror pattern.

Quick return to mirror mode\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Their strategy is more refined than we initially thought:\n- Mirror mode is their safe foundation\n- Punishment mode is a specific response to repetition\n- They only use prediction mode briefly\n- They rapidly return to their most successful strategy (mirroring)\n\nRisk Analyst: We face a strategic dilemma:\n1. Staying in mirror mode guarantees ties\n2. Triggering punishment mode guarantees a loss\n3. Their brief prediction mode hasn't shown vulnerability\n4. They've demonstrated perfect adaptation timing\n\nGame Strategist: Given this understanding, we have three options:\n1. Accept the tie pattern in mirror mode\n2. Try to find another trigger besides repetition\n3. Test if faster mode transitions are possible\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Since they've shown such a strong preference for returning to mirror mode, perhaps we should test if there's a way to disrupt their mode transition timing.\n\nRisk Analyst: I recommend playing rock again because:\n1. It's a controlled test of their punishment mode\n2. We know exactly how they'll respond (paper)\n3. This time we'll be prepared for their full sequence\n4. It gives us a chance to study their mode transition timing in detail\n5. We can plan our follow-up moves more strategically\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. By deliberately triggering their punishment mode with a repeated rock, we can study their full mode transition sequence with complete awareness.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock A deliberate repetition to trigger their punishment mode, allowing us to study their complete mode transition sequence with full preparation.\n"

This shows their algorithm is more sophisticated than we thought:\n1. They don't always punish repetition with the same counter\n2. Their response to repetition might be contextual\n3. Our previous understanding was incomplete\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Let's analyze why they chose scissors instead of paper:\n1. Paper would have been the obvious punishment\n2. Scissors was unexpected and still won\n3. They might be adapting their punishment strategy\n4. They could be learning from our previous interactions\n\nRisk Analyst: Current situation assessment:\n1. They've shown new behavioral complexity\n2. Their punishment mode is more sophisticated\n3. We can't rely on predicting their specific punishment move\n4. They might have pattern recognition across multiple games\n\nGame Strategist: Given this new information, we should:\n1. Avoid making assumptions about their specific counter-moves\n2. Consider that their algorithm might be learning and evolving\n3. Treat each response as potentially unique\n\nBehavioral Analyst: After a successful unexpected punishment move, they might:\n1. Return to mirroring (their safe strategy)\n2. Continue with adaptive responses\n3. Try to establish a new pattern\n\nRisk Analyst: I recommend playing paper because:\n1. It's strong against a return to mirroring (if they play paper)\n2. It beats rock if they try to establish a pattern\n3. If they're truly adaptive, any move is equally risky\n4. It helps us gather more information about their post-punishment behavior\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Paper is the optimal probe move in this situation of increased uncertainty while maintaining strategic potential.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper A strategic move to test their behavior after an unexpected punishment while maintaining balanced positioning against multiple possible responses.\n"
