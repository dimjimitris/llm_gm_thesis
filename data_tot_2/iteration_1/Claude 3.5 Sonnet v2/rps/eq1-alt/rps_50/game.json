Recent sequence analysis:\n   * Their last moves:\n     - paper\n     - scissors\n     - paper\n   * Just tied with paper after winning with scissors\n   * Shows flexibility in move choice\n   * Willing to switch between moves\n\n2. Post-tie psychology:\n   * After a tie with paper:\n     - Both players know paper is obvious\n     - Natural instinct is to switch\n     - They've shown they understand these dynamics\n   * They often make unexpected choices\n   * They seem to think multiple moves ahead\n\n3. Strategic observation:\n   * They've consistently:\n     - Avoided predictable patterns\n     - Made strong strategic choices\n     - Countered my attempts to read them\n   * When I try to outthink them, I often lose\n   * When I play more directly, I do better\n\n4. Current dynamics:\n   * Paper just tied\n   * They might expect:\n     - Me to play scissors to beat paper\n     - Or rock to beat expected scissors\n   * Multiple levels of mind games possible\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   * Over-analysis has often led to losses\n   * They excel at complex strategy\n   * A simpler approach might be better\n   * Rock would:\n     - Beat scissors if they try to counter paper\n     - Tie with rock if they mirror\n     - Lose to paper if they maintain\n   * Given their sophisticated play\n   * And success with unexpected moves\n\n[move] rock Playing rock as a straightforward choice, avoiding complex mind games. This covers scissors (their likely counter to paper) while accepting risk of continued paper play.\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
