    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Our opponent played rock in the first round, which could indicate:\n1. They might be aggressive and favor rock as a strong move\n2. They might switch strategies after a successful move\n3. They might try to establish a pattern to trick us\n\nGame Strategist: We need to consider that our opponent:\n1. Beat us with rock vs paper (-3 points for us)\n2. Went for the high-risk, high-reward move\n3. Might anticipate us switching to scissors to counter their previous rock\n\nRisk Manager: Given our significant loss (-3 points), we should be more conservative this round. Looking at the moves:\n- Paper is risky given they just used rock\n- Rock could be good if they switch to scissors expecting us to counter their previous move\n- Scissors is risky if they stick to rock\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing rock for these reasons:\n1. If they stick to rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n2. If they switch to paper expecting us to play scissors, we win 3 points\n3. If they play scissors trying to beat our expected paper, we win 1 point\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Rock gives us the best coverage against multiple scenarios while protecting against another major loss.\n\nRisk Manager: The defensive rock play makes sense.

We need to be strategic but not overly aggressive in trying to make up points.\n\nGame Strategist: Consider this: they might expect us to play paper to counter their repeated rock usage. If so, they might play scissors to counter our paper. Therefore, I suggest playing rock:\n1. Beats scissors if they try to counter our expected paper\n2. Ties with rock if they stay consistent\n3.

Their sequence shows no clear pattern, but they might be trying to be unpredictable\n\nGame Strategist: Our current total score is now 0 (-3-1+1+3).

No clear predictable strategy\n\nRisk Manager: After our big win, the opponent might:\n1. Play more cautiously\n2. Try to surprise us with an aggressive move\n3.

First tie of the game\n2. They matched our scissors move\n3. No move has been used more than twice\n4.

Scissors: Balanced risk (-1 vs rock) and reward (+1 vs paper)\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie with scissors, many players default to rock (thinking their opponent will switch to paper). However, this opponent has shown they're strategic. I suggest paper because:\n1. If they play predictably and switch to rock, we win 3 points\n2.

Force the opponent to take risks\n\nGame Strategist: Given their recent rock play and consecutive losses, they're likely to:\n1. Abandon rock since it just failed\n2. Possibly try paper to counter our expected rock\n3. Might use scissors as a surprise move\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their behavior after consecutive losses typically shows a significant strategy shift. Paper seems their most logical move as it:\n1. Counters our potential defensive rock play\n2. Gives them chance for 3 points to recover\n3. Breaks from their recent rock pattern\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend rock because:\n1. Beats scissors if they try that surprise move\n2. Only loses 3 points to paper (which we can afford with our lead)\n3. Ties with rock if they stubbornly stick to it\n\nGame Strategist: I disagree. Our lead isn't large enough to risk -3 points. I suggest scissors:\n1. Beats paper if they make that logical play\n2. Only loses 1 point to rock if they're stubborn\n3. Ties with scissors if they mirror us\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree with Game Strategist. Scissors provides better risk-reward given the game state and opponent's likely adaptations.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\nPlaying scissors provides balanced risk-reward while protecting our lead, especially given the opponent's likely shift away from rock after consecutive losses.\n"

They might expect us to play rock and counter with paper\n4. Or they might expect us to overthink and stay with scissors\n\nRisk Manager: With our +2 lead:\n1. We should avoid high-risk moves\n2. Paper is risky (-3 vs rock)\n3. Rock risks -3 vs paper\n4. Scissors provides balanced risk (-1 vs rock)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given their past behavior after ties:\n1. They rarely repeat the same move\n2. They've shown ability to read our strategy\n3. They might expect us to switch to rock\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend staying with scissors because:\n1. Most players wouldn't expect triple scissors\n2. If they play paper (expecting our rock), we win\n3. If they play rock (the common post-tie move), we only lose 1 point\n4. If they also stay with scissors, we maintain our lead with a tie\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. Scissors provides the best risk-adjusted outcome.

Second paper tie of game\n2. Sequence of ties building up\n3. They continue to mirror our moves effectively\n4. Game becoming extremely psychological\n\nGame Strategist: The situation has become highly complex:\n1. Multiple consecutive ties suggest:\n   - Both players thinking similarly\n   - Both trying to outthink each other\n   - High-level mind games at play\n2. Late game pressure increasing\n3. Need to break tie cycle decisively\n\nRisk Manager: Current state:\n1. Even score persists\n2. Very late in game\n3. Need to break deadlock\n4. Can't afford major mistakes\n\nPattern Analyzer: After paper ties:\n1. Previous paper tie led to scissors from opponent\n2. They've shown ability to:\n   - Mirror our moves\n   - Break patterns unexpectedly\n   - Read our attempts to break patterns\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock because:\n1. Direct counter to likely scissors play\n2. They might expect us to play scissors to beat their expected paper\n3. Could catch them overthinking\n4. Potentially decisive late-game move\n\nRisk Manager: I disagree. At this crucial stage, scissors provides better balance:\n1. Beats paper if they repeat\n2. Only loses 1 to rock if they try to counter\n3. Could break the tie cycle with controlled risk\n\nPattern Analyzer: I support scissors. Given their sophisticated play and the late-game situation, scissors offers:\n1. Better risk-reward ratio\n2. Protection against major losses\n3. Potential to break the tie cycle safely\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\nPlaying scissors provides the best balance of breaking the tie cycle while protecting against major losses in this crucial late-game situation.\n"

Unexpected win despite playing into their rock\n2. We're ahead by 1 in potentially final round\n3. Their rock play broke from their recent pattern\n4. They might be feeling pressure to make decisive moves\n\nGame Strategist: Current dynamics:\n1. We have a small but crucial lead\n2. Likely very late in game\n3. Opponent might be desperate to recover\n4. They've shown they can still surprise us\n\nRisk Manager: Critical situation:\n1. Must protect +1 lead\n2. Could be final round\n3. Can't afford major losses (-3)\n4. Opponent likely to make aggressive move\n\nPattern Analyzer: After losing with rock, they historically:\n1. Often switch strategies completely\n2. May play aggressively to recover\n3. Might try to surprise us\n4. Could expect us to play conservatively with our lead\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock because:\n1. Beats scissors if they get aggressive\n2. Only loses 3 to paper\n3. They might expect us to play paper thinking they'll play scissors\n4. Protects against desperate scissors play\n\nRisk Manager: I strongly disagree. With a +1 lead, we can't risk -3 points. I suggest scissors:\n1. Only loses 1 point to rock if they play defensively\n2. Beats paper if they try to counter our expected rock\n3. Better protects our lead\n4. Forces them to make a decisive move\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree with Risk Manager. Scissors provides better protection of our lead while maintaining winning potential. The opponent needs points and might take risks, making scissors the safer play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\nPlaying scissors best protects our lead while maintaining winning potential, especially given the opponent's need to score points and their likely aggressive strategy.\n"

They can't afford another tie\n3. They're likely to make aggressive move\n4. Paper would be their highest scoring option\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock because:\n1.

If they play paper (their best winning move), we only lose 3 points\n3. Forces them to make a decisive choice\n4.
