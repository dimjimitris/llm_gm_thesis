    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Rock has the highest potential gain but also highest potential loss.\n\nData Analyst: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no historical data, we don't have any patterns to analyze yet. However, in such games, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move since it offers the highest potential gain.\n\nDecision Maker: Given that this is the first move against a fresh player:\n1. If they play Rock (common first move), Paper would be optimal (+1)\n2. If they play Paper (countering Rock), Scissors would be optimal (+1)\n3. If they play Scissors (least likely), Rock would be optimal (+3)\nI suggest playing Paper as it gives us a +1 against the likely Rock play, and limits our loss to -1 if we're wrong.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper is a balanced first move. It has moderate risk (-1 worst case) with decent reward potential (+1).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Play Scissors - If they switch to Paper, we get +1\n\nGame Strategist: Given they won with an unexpected move, they might be confident and stick to Scissors. Even if they don't, Rock gives us the best risk-reward ratio here: +3 if they play Scissors, -3 if they play Paper, 0 if they play Rock.\n\nData Analyst: Agreed. Players who succeed with an unexpected move often try to repeat it, at least once more. Rock would be a strong counter.\n\nDecision Maker: The consensus seems clear. Let's play Rock.

Let's recap:\nRound 1: We played Paper, they played Scissors (we lost)\nRound 2: We played Rock, they played Rock (tie)\nThey seem to be making unpredictable moves, possibly trying to stay one step ahead.\n\nData Analyst: The opponent's pattern so far:\n1. First move: Scissors (aggressive, unexpected)\n2. Second move: Rock (defensive, common)\nThis suggests they might be switching strategies each round rather than following a consistent pattern.\n\nDecision Maker: Given their apparent strategy switching, let's evaluate our options:\n1. Paper beats Rock (+1/-1)\n2. Rock beats Scissors (+3/-3)\n3. Scissors beats Paper (+1/-1)\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie with Rock, many players will switch to Paper thinking their opponent will stay with Rock. However, since our opponent has shown to be unpredictable, we shouldn't rely too heavily on this assumption.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at their pattern, they haven't played Paper yet. Given their apparent strategy of mixing things up, Paper could be their next move.\n\nDecision Maker: In this case, I recommend playing Scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they play Paper (which they haven't used yet), we win (+1)\n2. If they play Rock (continuing last round), we lose but with minimal penalty (-1)\n3. If they play Scissors (their first move), we tie (0)\nThis gives us a balanced risk-reward profile against an unpredictable opponent.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed.

Scissors\n2. Rock\n3. Paper\nThey've now used all three moves in sequence, going from most aggressive (Scissors) to most defensive (Paper). This could be deliberate sequencing.\n\nGame Strategist: Important observation! Their sequence might suggest two things:\n1. Either they're following a deliberate pattern and will restart with Scissors\n2. Or they're using reverse psychology, expecting us to think that\n\nDecision Maker: Let's evaluate based on this:\n1. If they return to Scissors (following pattern), Paper would be worst choice\n2. If they continue their apparent \"progression\", they might use Scissors next\n3. They might expect us to overthink and use their previous move (Paper)\n\nGame Strategist: Given they've shown sophisticated play, they're likely aware we've observed their pattern.

Here's why:\n- Best payoff against Scissors (+3)\n- Ties against Rock (0)\n- Worst case against Paper (-3), but they just used Paper and have shown to avoid repetition\n\nDecision Maker: I agree with Rock. It gives us the highest potential gain against a player who's shown both strategic thinking and unpredictability.

However, this opponent has consistently shown they think several moves ahead.\n\nDecision Maker: Let's evaluate our options after this Paper-Paper tie:\n1. If they follow the classic sequence after Paper, they should play Scissors\n2. But they might expect us to think this and play Rock instead\n3. Or they might stick with Paper expecting us to overthink\n\nData Analyst: Given their sophisticated play style, they've shown they're good at using our own analysis against us. The fact that we're noticing the classic sequence might be exactly what they want.\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, I recommend Rock. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they play the expected Scissors, we win big (+3)\n2. If they stick with Paper, we lose but it's a calculated risk (-3)\n3. If they play Rock, we tie (0)\nGiven the point structure, this is a good moment to take a calculated risk for a bigger payoff.\n\nDecision Maker: I agree with Rock. After a tie, both players often look to break the stalemate.

The key is that Rock gives us the highest potential gain (+3) if they play Scissors\n\nDecision Maker: I agree with Rock. At this point:\n1. We need to try for a higher score play to make up for our losses\n2. Rock gives us the best potential payoff (+3)\n3. If we lose to Paper, we're no worse off than we've been (-3)\n4. It's a calculated risk worth taking given our current position\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The Scissors move they just played suggests they're confident in their ability to predict us.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest Paper for this round. Here's the reasoning:\n1. After a successful Scissors play, many players would avoid Paper\n2. But this opponent has shown they think differently\n3. Paper has balanced prospects: wins against Rock (+1), loses to Scissors (-1)\n4. We need to avoid another -3 loss, which could happen if we play Rock and they choose Paper\n\nDecision Maker: I agree with Paper. It's a measured response that:\n1. Limits our potential loss to -1 if they play Scissors again\n2. Gives us a win opportunity if they switch to Rock\n3. Avoids the risk of a -3 loss\n4.
