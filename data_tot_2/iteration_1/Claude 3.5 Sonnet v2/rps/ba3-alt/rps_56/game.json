Round 3: They played paper (they lost big)\n\nThey seem to be making somewhat predictable moves, returning to paper after losing with rock. After losing significantly with paper, they might:\n1. Stick with paper hoping I won't play rock again\n2. Switch to scissors expecting me to play paper\n3. Switch to rock as it's the only move they haven't lost with yet\n\nGiven they've shown a tendency to switch moves after losses, and paper gave them their biggest loss, I think they're most likely to change. I'll play paper to counter their potential rock play.\n\n[move] paper\n"
