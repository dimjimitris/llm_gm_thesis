    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Rock vs Paper has higher stakes.\n\nRisk Manager: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data. We should consider the risk-reward ratio. Rock has the highest risk (-3) and Paper has the highest potential reward (+3).\n\nPattern Analyzer: Without prior moves to analyze, we should start with a balanced approach. Paper is interesting because:\n1. It gives us the highest possible win (+3)\n2. If we lose with paper, the penalty is only -1\n3. It's a relatively safe opening move\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper offers the best risk-reward ratio for an opening move. We can potentially gain 3 points while risking only 1 point.\n\nRisk Manager: Concur. Paper presents the optimal balance between potential gain and potential loss for this first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper This opening move offers a good balance of risk and reward, with potential for high gain (+3) while limiting potential loss (-1).\n"

Switch to paper as a completely different approach\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at our options:\n- If we play rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3)\n- If we play paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n- If we play scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n\nGiven their previous move and possible psychology, rock seems like a good choice because:\n1.

Round 2: They played rock, tied (0)\nThis shows they're willing to adapt their strategy and aren't stuck in a pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: The tie with rock suggests two possibilities:\n1. They predicted our counter to their scissors\n2. They were trying to counter potential scissors from us\nEither way, they've shown strategic thinking.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the situation:\n1. They might expect us to stick with rock after a tie\n2. They could try to counter rock with paper\n3. They might try to be unpredictable with scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've used scissors and rock, they might complete the cycle with paper. However, that's a bit predictable. They might expect us to think that way and stick with rock or switch to scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at the progression (scissors \u2192 rock), paper would be the \"logical\" next move from their perspective. However, since they've shown adaptive behavior, we should be careful about this assumption.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, I suggest playing scissors because:\n1. If they play paper (the \"logical\" next move), we win (+1)\n2. If they play rock (repeat move), we lose but minimize damage (-1)\n3. If they play scissors (unexpected), we tie (0)\nThis gives us the most balanced risk-reward profile given the uncertainty.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed.

They might be avoiding the high-risk move (-3 if they lose with paper).\n\nGame Strategist: We should consider that after two ties, they might be eager to score a win. This could make them:\n1.

The rock play suggests they're thinking more defensively\n\nGame Strategist: Given this evolution, they might:\n1. Return to their successful paper strategy\n2. Continue experimenting with varied moves\n3. Use scissors as their traditional \"safe\" move\n4. Try to establish a new pattern\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend scissors because:\n1. They might return to paper after this defensive rock play\n2. Their history suggests paper as their comfort zone\n3. After defensive moves, they often return to aggressive paper plays\n4. Our point lead gives us room to take this risk\n\nPattern Analyzer: While their recent moves show more variety, historically they've always returned to paper after periods of uncertainty or defensive plays. The rock play might have been their version of a \"reset\" move, similar to how they used scissors before.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After a defensive rock play and recent pattern disruption, they might return to their historically successful paper strategy. Their tendency to revert to paper after defensive or uncertain phases makes this our best strategic choice.\n"

They've completely broken from their earlier patterns\n2. We're seeing a sequence of ties (paper-rock-scissors)\n3. Their moves are becoming more varied and unpredictable\n4. No clear pattern has emerged to replace their paper strategy\n\nRisk Manager: Current situation:\n- Still at +16 points\n- Four consecutive non-winning moves for them\n- They might be frustrated by the ties\n- They might want to break this tie sequence\n\nPattern Analyzer: Psychological state:\n1. They've moved away from their successful paper strategy\n2. Recent ties might be making them impatient\n3. They might be seeking a new winning approach\n4. Their last three moves followed the cycle: rock\u2192scissors\u2192?\n\nGame Strategist: Given rock\u2192scissors sequence, they might:\n1. Complete the natural cycle with paper\n2. Return to their historically successful paper strategy\n3. Repeat scissors hoping for a different outcome\n4. Use rock to break the pattern entirely\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend rock because:\n1. If they complete the natural cycle with paper, we win\n2. If they return to scissors, we win\n3. If they use rock, we tie\n4. Our point lead allows us to make this aggressive play\n\nPattern Analyzer: The rock\u2192scissors sequence naturally suggests paper might come next. Additionally, their historical success with paper and current streak of ties might make paper an attractive choice for them to break this pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Their recent rock\u2192scissors sequence suggests paper might complete the cycle. This move would also counter any repeated scissors play while maintaining a safe tie option against rock.
