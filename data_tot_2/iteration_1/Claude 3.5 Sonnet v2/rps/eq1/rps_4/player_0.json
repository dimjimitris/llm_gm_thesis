    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior and adapting strategies\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk/reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In such cases, game theory suggests that each move should be equally likely to be chosen by a rational opponent.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move and we have no historical data, we can't predict any patterns yet. However, we should note what move is made by the opponent for future reference.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the equal payoff structure (+1 for winning, -1 for losing, 0 for tie) and no prior information, each move carries the same risk/reward profile. Some studies suggest that \"rock\" is often a popular first move choice among human players due to its perceived \"strength.\"\n\nGame Strategist: Given that rock is often a common first move, we could consider playing paper to counter this tendency. However, if the opponent is sophisticated, they might anticipate this and play scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree with playing paper. Even if we lose this round, we'll gain valuable information about our opponent's strategy for future rounds.\n\nRisk Manager: The downside risk is limited to -1 point, and the potential upside is +1 point. Paper seems like a reasonable choice given the psychological tendencies of first-move players.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move and rock is a common opening choice, paper provides a good counter while helping establish information about the opponent's strategy.\n"

Switch tactics after losing\n2. Possibly anticipate that we might play paper again\n3. Be more strategic in their second move\n\nGame Strategist: Having won with paper, we need to consider that the opponent will likely adapt. They might:\n1. Use scissors to counter our previous paper\n2. Use paper themselves, thinking we might go back to rock\n3. Stick with rock, hoping we overthink\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has shown a conventional opening strategy. They're likely to switch after losing, and scissors would be their most logical counter to our previous paper play. We should adapt accordingly.\n\nGame Strategist: If they're using basic game theory, scissors would indeed be their most rational next move to counter our previous success with paper. Therefore, rock would be our optimal counter-move.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. The psychological dynamics suggest they'll want to break our winning streak, and scissors is the most direct way to counter our previous paper play. Rock would protect against this most likely adaptation.\n\nRisk Manager: The risk/reward still remains the same (-1/+1), but rock gives us the best probability of success based on likely opponent adaptation patterns. It protects against the most probable counter-move (scissors) while only being vulnerable to paper, which is a less likely choice in this scenario.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Our opponent is likely to switch to scissors to counter our previous paper play, making rock our optimal counter-move for this round.\n"

Round 2: Opponent played scissors, we won with rock\nThe opponent has shown a predictable adaptation pattern - they're changing moves each time and following the logical counter to our previous move.\n\nGame Strategist: This suggests our opponent is using a relatively straightforward strategic thinking process:\n- They tried to counter our paper with scissors\n- If they follow the same pattern, they might try to counter our rock with paper\n\nRisk Manager: We've built a 2-point lead, which puts us in a strong position. The opponent might be getting frustrated with their predictable strategy failing twice. They might:\n1. Try to break their pattern to become less predictable\n2. Continue their pattern of trying to counter our last move\n3.

However, they might realize we can predict this and try to break the pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, scissors would be our optimal play. It would:\n1. Counter their most likely move (paper)\n2. Only be vulnerable to rock, which they've only used in their opening move\n3.

We're now up 3 points, and we can predict with high confidence that they will try to counter our scissors with rock. However, we should consider two possibilities:\n1. They continue their pattern (most likely)\n2. They finally realize their pattern is predictable and change strategy\n\nRisk Manager: We're in an excellent position:\n- We're up 3 points\n- We've correctly read their strategy three times\n- The opponent may be frustrated and more likely to stick to their pattern out of tilt\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological pressure is significant. After losing three rounds, they're likely to either:\n1. Stubbornly stick to their strategy, hoping it finally works\n2. Completely abandon their strategy in frustration\nHowever, given their consistent behavior so far, option 1 seems more likely.\n\nGame Strategist: If they maintain their pattern, they will play rock to counter our scissors.
