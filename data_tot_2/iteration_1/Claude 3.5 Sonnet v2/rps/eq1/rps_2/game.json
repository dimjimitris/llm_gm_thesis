The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

        "A tie after four consecutive wins - an interesting development. The game phases are clear:\n\n1. Early game: Their 4 wins (pattern-based)\n2. Mid game: My 8 wins (pattern prediction)\n3. Late game: Their 5 wins (pattern breaking)\n4. Current: Tie, 4 wins, tie (independent decisions)\n\nThe tie suggests that either:\n1. They've started adapting to my independent decision-making strategy\n2. Pure coincidence in move selection (which is actually a good sign as it suggests true independence)\n3. They might be testing a new approach\n\nThe success of my non-pattern-based strategy remains evident, as even a tie is better than the losses we saw when I was using pattern-based thinking.
