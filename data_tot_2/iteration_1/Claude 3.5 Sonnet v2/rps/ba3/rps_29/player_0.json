    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, paper also risks losing 1 point to scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they have no prior information about our strategy. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move because it feels \"strong\" psychologically.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the scenarios:\n- If we play paper: Win 3 points vs rock, Lose 1 point vs scissors, Tie vs paper\n- If we play rock: Win 1 point vs scissors, Lose 3 points vs paper, Tie vs rock\n- If we play scissors: Win 1 point vs paper, Lose 1 point vs rock, Tie vs scissors\n\nGame Theorist: Given that paper has the highest potential reward and people often choose rock first, I suggest we go with paper for this opening move.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Paper gives us the best risk-reward ratio for an opening move, especially considering the psychological tendency of new players to choose rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: The downside of losing 1 point to scissors is acceptable given the potential upside of gaining 3 points against rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move against a fresh player, paper offers the best risk-reward ratio with potential for highest points gain.\n"

Our opponent played scissors in the first round, showing they were either anticipating our paper move or they have an aggressive strategy focusing on attacking paper plays.\n\nStrategic Planner: They might expect us to switch to rock now (as a natural counter to their previous scissors). This could be a good opportunity for mind games. They might think we're trying to counter their last move.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our options considering their last move:\n1. If they stick with scissors: Rock would win us 1 point, Paper would lose 1 point, Scissors would tie\n2. If they switch to rock (expecting our rock): Paper would win 3 points, Rock would tie, Scissors would lose 1 point\n3. If they switch to paper: Scissors would win 1 point, Rock would lose 3 points, Paper would tie\n\nGame Theorist: Given they played scissors first, they might be an aggressive player who likes the quick-striking scissors move. Many players don't stick with the same move twice, though.\n\nStrategic Planner: I suggest we play rock here. Here's why:\n- It beats their previous move (scissors) if they repeat it\n- Even if they switch to paper (expecting our rock), we only lose 3 points, but there's less chance they'll make this double-mind-game play\n- If they switch to rock, we tie and lose nothing\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with rock. The worst case is losing 3 points to paper, but we have good chances of either winning 1 point or getting a tie.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Our opponent showed aggressive play with scissors.

If they're following basic pattern recognition, they're likely to play paper next, thinking we might stick with rock after a tie.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n1.

It beats the predicted paper and only risks losing 1 point to rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: I concur. Scissors offers a good risk-reward ratio in this situation.

Continue their rotation (which would mean scissors next)\n2. Try to break their pattern to be less predictable\n3. Try to counter what beat them (scissors) by playing rock\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate based on their most likely responses:\n1.

They might be hoping we think they'll break the pattern now\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the scenarios:\n1.

This suggests they might be a novice player who's sticking to a simple strategy, or they're very committed to making us doubt the pattern's continuation.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing paper here. Here's why:\n- If they maintain rotation (highly likely based on all evidence), we'll win 3 points against rock\n- Even if they break pattern, our maximum loss is only 1 point (to scissors)\n- The psychological pressure of multiple losses might make them stick to their pattern even more firmly, believing we might expect them to break it\n\nRisk Analyst: Agree with paper.
