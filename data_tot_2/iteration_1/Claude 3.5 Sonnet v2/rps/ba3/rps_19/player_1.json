    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Rock is a common first move for many players as it feels \"safe\"\n2. Paper has the highest potential payoff (+3)\n3. The risk of losing with paper (-1 vs scissors) is less severe than the potential gain (+3 vs rock)\n\nI suggest we play Paper as our first move. It gives us the highest potential gain, and even if we lose, the penalty is minimal.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with both analyses. The risk-reward ratio favors Paper as our first move. We can potentially gain 3 points if the opponent plays Rock, and only risk losing 1 point if they play Scissors.\n\n[move] paper Based on risk-reward analysis, choosing paper for potential maximum gain while minimizing potential loss.\n"

We correctly predicted a Rock opening and gained the maximum 3 points. Now, for the second round, we need to consider that the opponent has experienced a significant loss and might adjust their strategy.\n\nStrategic Advisor: After losing to Paper with Rock, the opponent is likely to:\n1. Either switch to Scissors to counter our Paper (a common reaction after losing)\n2. Or stick to Rock hoping we'll think they'll switch (some players are persistent)\n\nGiven the previous success with Paper might make the opponent assume we'll use it again, they have a strong incentive to switch to Scissors. Therefore, I suggest we play Rock this round. This would:\n- Beat their Scissors if they try to counter our previous Paper\n- Tie if they stubbornly stick to Rock\n- Only lose if they make the less likely play of Paper (as they just saw us win with it)\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the Strategic Advisor's analysis. The psychological factor of the opponent just losing to Paper makes Scissors their most likely move as a counter-strategy. Playing Rock gives us a good chance to win or at worst tie, while protecting against the most likely opponent response.\n\n[move] rock Anticipating opponent's adjustment to counter our previous paper play.\n"

The opponent has shown a pattern:\n1. First move: Rock (conservative)\n2. Second move: Scissors (trying to counter our Paper)\nBoth moves lost, so they're likely to:\n- Avoid Rock (lost badly to it)\n- Be wary of Scissors (just lost with it)\n- Consider Paper as it's the only move they haven't tried yet and it would have beaten both our previous winning moves\n\nGiven this psychology, Paper is their most logical choice. Therefore, I recommend playing Scissors this round.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis makes sense. The opponent has probably noticed that they haven't tried Paper yet, and it would have been effective against both our previous moves.

The opponent appears to be more conservative than we anticipated. Instead of trying Paper as we predicted, they went back to Rock - perhaps feeling that Rock is \"safe.\" Their pattern suggests they:\n1. Start conservative (Rock)\n2. Try to counter (Scissors)\n3. Return to safety (Rock)\n\nGiven this demonstrated preference for Rock in \"uncertain\" situations, and their success with it in the last round, they might:\n- Stick with Rock again since it just worked\n- Or finally try Paper, thinking we might go Rock to counter their Rock\n\nI suggest we play Paper again. It will:\n- Win big (+3) if they stick with Rock\n- Tie if they also choose Paper\n- Only lose small (-1) if they choose Scissors\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree.

The opponent has:\n1. Finally tried Paper after avoiding it for four rounds\n2. Successfully broken their obvious alternating pattern\n3.

After a tie, players often:\n- Either stick with the same move hoping their opponent will change\n- Or try to counter what they think their opponent will play next\n\nGiven that we've used Paper multiple times (Rounds 1, 4, and 5), they might expect us to switch away from it.

In a situation where pattern recognition has failed, we should focus on the immediate last move and basic game theory.

Three consecutive positive results after the ties\n2. Still maintaining perfect record of no losses\n3. Nearly back to neutral score from our low of -8\n4. Shows consistent success across all move types\n\nGame Theorist: The statistical success is even more impressive:\n- Pre-randomization: -8 points over 8 rounds (average -1 per round)\n- With randomization: +10 points over 9 rounds (average +1.11 per round)\n- System has proven reliable and profitable across multiple rounds\n\nAI Assistant (me): Agreed. Our round-based randomization continues to deliver excellent results, with three straight wins following the ties. We should maintain this highly successful system.\n\n[move] paper Following our round-based randomization system that has produced 6 wins and 2 ties with no losses over 9 rounds.\n"

While we've taken our first loss using the system, the overall results remain extremely positive.
