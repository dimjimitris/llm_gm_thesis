    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior and identifying trends\n3. Psychology Expert - For understanding human behavior in decision-making\n4. Risk Assessor - For evaluating different moves and their potential outcomes\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to work with. In game theory, when playing against a rational opponent with no prior information, each move should have an equal probability of being chosen.\n\nPsychology Expert: In the first round, many players tend to choose 'rock' as their initial move. This is because rock is often perceived as a \"strong\" or \"stable\" choice, and it's commonly the first thing people think of when they hear \"rock-paper-scissors.\"\n\nPattern Analyzer: While we don't have any pattern to analyze yet, it's worth noting that we should pay attention to the opponent's first move as it might give us insights for future rounds.\n\nRisk Assessor: Given the equal points structure (+1 for win, -1 for loss, 0 for tie), there's no inherent risk difference between the moves. However, if we consider the psychology expert's input about 'rock' being a common first move, we might want to counter that.\n\nGame Strategist: Based on the psychology expert's insight about 'rock' being a common first move, paper would be the optimal counter-choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move and many players tend to start with rock, paper would be a strategic choice to potentially counter that tendency.\n"

Now, let's analyze what they might do next:\n1. After losing to paper, they might expect us to use paper again and choose scissors\n2. They might stick to rock thinking we'll change our strategy\n3. They might switch to paper themselves, thinking we'll choose rock\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who lose their first round often change their strategy. After losing to paper, there's a strong psychological tendency to switch to scissors, as it's the natural counter to what just beat them.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we won the first round with paper, the opponent is likely to adjust their strategy. The most logical counter would be scissors, making rock our optimal move.\n\nRisk Assessor: The opponent has experienced a loss and will likely be more cautious. The safest play here would be rock, as it:\n1. Beats the most likely response (scissors)\n2. Ties against another rock if they're stubborn\n3. Only loses to paper, which is less likely as they just lost to it\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with the Risk Assessor. Human players rarely stick to a move that just lost, and they rarely immediately switch to the move that just beat them.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the psychological tendency of players to counter their previous losing match-up, our opponent is likely to play scissors to beat our previous paper move.

Let's analyze what we've seen so far:\nRound 1: Opponent played rock, we won with paper\nRound 2: Opponent played paper, we lost with rock\nThis shows our opponent is adapting and might be following a pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors?\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has shown they're capable of adapting and thinking ahead. They've also just won, which typically boosts confidence and might lead to either:\n1. Sticking with the winning move (paper)\n2. Following through with the standard sequence to scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the sequence, if we assume they're using basic pattern recognition, they might complete the traditional rock-paper-scissors sequence by playing scissors next. However, they might also be thinking multiple levels ahead, expecting us to think this way.\n\nRisk Assessor: Given that they've won the last round:\n- If they're confident, they might stick with paper\n- If they're following the sequence, they'll play scissors\n- They're less likely to switch back to rock as it would break both the winning momentum and the sequence\n\nPattern Analyzer: The most common pattern in RPS is the cycling sequence. Given their moves so far (rock \u2192 paper), scissors would complete this basic sequence.\n\nGame Strategist: Based on these analyses, rock would be our safest play:\n- It beats scissors (if they follow the sequence)\n- It loses to paper (if they stick to their winning move)\n- But given the psychological tendency to complete patterns, scissors is more likely\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Given the likely completion of the rock-paper-scissors sequence and the psychological tendency to change moves after a win, our opponent is most likely to play scissors, making rock our optimal choice.\n"

Two key psychological factors to consider:\n1. They've shown they understand basic patterns by following the RPS sequence\n2. They've lost twice now, which might make them more unpredictable as they try to \"break\" the pattern\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has demonstrated:\n- Strategic thinking (adapting after first loss)\n- Pattern following (complete RPS sequence)\n- Now they're at a decision point where they need to start a new pattern\n\nRisk Assessor: Looking at their behavior after losses:\n- After their first loss (rock), they played paper and won\n- This might influence them to similarly change their strategy after this loss\n\nPattern Analyzer: If they're trying to be unpredictable after following such a clear pattern, they might avoid starting another obvious sequence. After scissors and rock, paper would be too predictable.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players often avoid repeating their most recent move after a loss. Since they just played scissors, and lost, they're more likely to switch to either paper or rock, with paper being less obvious as it would complete another sequence.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all this, scissors would be our optimal play:\n- It beats paper if they try to repeat their previous winning strategy\n- It loses to rock if they play conservatively\n- But paper seems more likely given their demonstrated strategic thinking\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Based on the opponent's demonstrated pattern recognition and the psychological tendency to avoid both their recent losing move and obvious sequences, they're likely to play paper in an attempt to be less predictable.\n"

After scissors-scissors, common responses are:\n1. Stay with scissors hoping opponent switches\n2. Switch to rock to beat previous scissors\n3. Switch to paper expecting opponent to switch to rock\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie might make them more cautious. Players often become more conservative after a tie, as it creates uncertainty about their read on their opponent.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all this, paper would be our optimal play because:\n1.

Take total rounds played (19)\n2. Add number of wins (7)\n3. Multiply by number of ties (5)\n4. Take modulo 3\n5. 0: Rock, 1: Paper, 2: Scissors\n\nGame Strategist: With scores perfectly even late in the game, maintaining pure randomness is crucial. Each move is critical now.\n\nPsychology Expert: The pressure of an even score might tempt us to try to outsmart our opponent, but we must trust our mechanical randomization.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Our commitment to randomness has served us well, bringing us back to even scores repeatedly.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Using our latest mathematical formula to maintain true randomness, avoiding any strategic bias despite the high-pressure situation of even scores.\n"
