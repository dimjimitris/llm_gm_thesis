    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For identifying patterns in opponent behavior\n3. Psychology Expert - For understanding human behavior in game situations\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, without any prior history, game theory suggests that each move (rock, paper, scissors) should have an equal probability of being chosen for optimal play. No move has inherent advantage.\n\nPsychology Expert: When people play rock-paper-scissors for the first time, studies suggest they tend to choose rock more frequently as their first move. This is because rock is perceived as \"strong\" and is often the first gesture people think of.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move and we have no historical data to analyze, we should consider both the game theory optimal strategy and psychological insights.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the psychology insight about rock being a common first move, paper would be a strategic counter-choice, as it beats rock. However, if the opponent is also thinking strategically, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: I still recommend going with paper. Even if the opponent is strategic, most casual players don't overthink their first move and tend to go with their instinct, which often leads to rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. The psychological advantage of choosing paper against a likely rock seems to outweigh the risk of facing scissors in this first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on psychological tendencies in first-move choices and strategic considerations\n"

This suggests they might be a more strategic player.\n\nPsychology Expert: When players tie with a move, there's a psychological tendency to either:\n1. Stick with the same move, believing the opponent will change\n2. Switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move\n3. Switch to the move that would have lost to their previous move\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we tied with paper, let's analyze the opponent's likely thought process:\n- If they think we'll stay with paper, they might choose scissors\n- If they think we'll switch to scissors (to beat their expected paper), they might choose rock\n- If they think we'll switch to rock (to avoid their expected scissors), they might stick with paper\n\nPsychology Expert: Most players tend to change their move after a tie, as staying with the same move feels psychologically unsatisfying. The most common pattern is to switch to the move that would have beaten the previous move.\n\nGame Strategist: If the opponent follows this common pattern, they're likely to choose scissors to beat our previous paper. Therefore, we should choose rock to counter their likely scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. The psychological tendency to change moves after a tie, combined with the logical progression of choosing the move that beats the previous tie, makes scissors their most likely choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the likelihood of opponent switching to scissors after our paper tie\n"

Let's analyze what we know:\nRound 1: They played paper (tie)\nRound 2: They played scissors (they lost)\n\nPsychology Expert: After a loss, players often exhibit one of these behaviors:\n1. Switch to what would have beaten their losing move (paper to beat our rock)\n2. Mirror their opponent's winning move (rock, copying us)\n3. Make a completely different choice out of frustration\n\nGame Strategist: This is a critical moment. The opponent has lost and might be trying to regain control. Let's analyze each possibility:\n- If they choose paper to beat our rock: we should choose scissors\n- If they mirror our rock: we should choose paper\n- If they choose scissors again (less likely): we should stick with rock\n\nPsychology Expert: The most common response after losing is to switch to what would have beaten the opponent's winning move. In this case, they are most likely to choose paper to counter our successful rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. Their moves so far (paper \u2192 scissors) show they're making logical progressions. Following this pattern and the psychological tendency after a loss, paper is their most probable move.\n\nGame Strategist: The analysis points strongly toward them choosing paper.

This is a psychologically significant moment that will likely strongly influence their next move.\n\nPsychology Expert: After two consecutive losses, players typically:\n1. Become more unpredictable, trying to break their losing streak\n2. Question their strategy completely\n3. May become more aggressive or defensive\nThe frustration factor is now significant, which often leads to less rational decision-making.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Interestingly, they returned to paper after losing with scissors, showing they might be getting predictable under pressure. However, after losing twice, they're likely to break any pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's consider their possible thought processes:\n- They might expect us to predict scissors again (since it just worked)\n- They might try rock as it's the only move they haven't used yet\n- They might use scissors aggressively to try to break their losing streak\n\nPsychology Expert: Under this much pressure from consecutive losses, players often resort to rock as it feels psychologically \"strongest\" and they haven't used it yet. It's a common \"reset\" move when other strategies aren't working.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree.

After three consecutive losses, players typically:\n1. Enter a highly emotional state\n2. May become completely irrational\n3. Might resort to desperate strategies\n4. Could either become ultra-aggressive or completely defensive\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent is likely in a \"tilt\" state now, which means their moves might become:\n- Highly aggressive (trying to \"force\" a win)\n- Completely random (abandoning any strategy)\n- Or paradoxically, very predictable (falling back to basic instincts)\n\nPsychology Expert: In such a frustrated state, players often resort to scissors as an aggressive move. It represents a \"cutting through\" of their problems and feels like an active, aggressive choice when feeling backed into a corner.\n\nPattern Analyzer: They've now used all three moves (paper, scissors, rock) and lost with each except their initial paper tie. In a desperate state, they might return to paper since it's the only move that didn't result in a loss for them.\n\nGame Strategist: I disagree with expecting paper. Given the psychological state after three losses, the aggressive scissors choice seems more likely. They're probably too frustrated to think about their one non-losing move from the beginning.\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly agree with the scissors prediction. The combination of frustration, need for aggression, and the psychological desire to \"cut through\" their losing streak makes scissors the most likely choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on opponent's likely aggressive scissors play after three consecutive losses\n"

After four consecutive losses, we're dealing with a player who is likely to be:\n1. In complete psychological distress\n2. Possibly angry or frustrated beyond rational thought\n3. Feeling completely helpless\n4. Might either give up mentally or become desperately unpredictable\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, traditional game theory becomes less relevant. The opponent is likely to either:\n- Make a completely random choice out of desperation\n- Try to \"outsmart\" us by doing something unexpected\n- Or paradoxically, become so frustrated they make an obvious choice\n\nPsychology Expert: In such extreme situations, players often revert to their most basic instinct - rock. It's like a psychological \"reset button\" when nothing else is working. The feeling of \"solidity\" and \"strength\" associated with rock can be appealing when feeling completely defeated.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at their sequence (paper\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors), they haven't shown any clear patterns. However, after losing with scissors, and in their current psychological state, I agree that rock becomes very likely.\n\nGame Strategist: While rock might be psychologically appealing to them, we should also consider that they might try to break out of their losing streak by doing something completely unexpected. However, in states of extreme stress, people often revert to basic, instinctive choices rather than clever strategies.\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly believe they will choose rock. When players reach this level of frustration, they often abandon complex thinking and resort to the most basic, \"strongest-feeling\" move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on opponent's likely reversion to rock as a psychological \"reset\" after four consecutive losses\n"

It breaks their losing streak and might give them a confidence boost. After a tie following a long losing streak, players often:\n1. Feel relieved to not lose\n2. Might try to build on this \"success\" by sticking with what worked\n3. Or might feel emboldened to try something new now that they're not losing\n\nGame Strategist: The situation has several layers:\n- They might stick with paper since it just \"worked\" (relatively speaking)\n- They might expect us to switch to scissors to beat their paper\n- They might try to get ahead of our thinking by switching to rock\n\nPattern Analyzer: Both times they played paper, it resulted in ties. This might create a psychological association between paper and \"not losing,\" making it tempting for them to stick with it.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, the relief of breaking their losing streak might make them more rational now. They might realize that sticking with paper is too predictable, especially since we just tied with it.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've shown the ability to think strategically (as evidenced by their first move), and now that they're not on a losing streak anymore, they're likely to return to more tactical thinking.

This pattern likely hasn't gone unnoticed by them.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their successful adaptability after ties suggests they'll switch again, especially given their pattern of improving results when doing so.\n\nGame Strategist: They have shown sophisticated thinking in recent rounds.

This loss might be particularly frustrating because:\n1. It breaks their recent streak of non-losing moves\n2. They followed their previously successful pattern of switching after ties, but it failed\n3. They might feel their strategy is becoming predictable\n\nGame Strategist: Their decision-making has been quite sophisticated in recent rounds. After losses, their patterns show:\n- Early game losses led to emotional, less strategic choices\n- But recent losses (when they were playing better) led to more calculated responses\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at their behavior after their last few losses:\n- They've grown beyond their early-game emotional responses\n- They've shown ability to adapt and think strategically\n- They're likely to try to counter what they think we'll do next\n\nPsychology Expert: This loss is different from their early losing streak because they were playing strategically when it happened. They're likely to respond with calculated adjustment rather than emotional reaction.\n\nGame Strategist: They might reason that:\n1. We'll expect them to switch to rock after losing with paper\n2. Therefore, we might play paper to beat their expected rock\n3. So scissors would be their optimal choice to beat our paper\n\nPattern Analyzer: However, given their demonstrated ability to think multiple steps ahead, they might also consider that we'd follow this exact reasoning. This might lead them back to choosing rock as a counter to our predicted scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Their recent play shows they're capable of this level of strategic depth.

Attempt to return to their more successful strategic play\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at their options:\n1. Scissors would counter our expected paper (to beat their rock)\n2.

Try to copy their mid-game success pattern (scissors - which gave them a win)\n3.

Complete randomization of choices\n2. Reversion to their most basic instincts\n\nGame Strategist: Given their experience level now, complete randomization is less likely. They're more likely to:\n1. Try to break their losing streak with their historically strongest move\n2.

It feels like an aggressive \"breaking out\" move\n2. It was their first winning move in the game\n3. It represents taking action rather than being defensive\n\nGame Strategist: I disagree. At this point, they might realize that we're anticipating their psychological state. They might try to use their desperation to their advantage by making the least aggressive choice - paper.\n\nPattern Analyzer: However, history shows that under maximum pressure, they've consistently chosen scissors.

Lost nine times in a row\n2. Failed with every possible strategy\n3. Tried both aggressive (scissors) and defensive (rock) approaches\n4. Possibly reached a state of complete emotional numbness\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, traditional strategy analysis becomes almost meaningless because:\n1. They've tried every possible move multiple times\n2. Every choice has led to failure\n3. They might have completely given up on trying to win\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their recent sequence:\npaper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\nShows they've cycled through all moves, with scissors being their most recent failed attempt.\n\nPsychology Expert: In situations of complete defeat, players often:\n1. Stop trying to make strategic decisions\n2. React purely based on their most basic instincts\n3. Choose moves almost mechanically\n4. Or make their choice based on simple pattern completion\n\nGame Strategist: After their complete cycle (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), the simplest and most basic response would be to start the cycle again with paper. This requires no strategic thinking, just pattern following.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. When all strategic thinking has failed, players often default to simple patterns. Starting the cycle again with paper would be the path of least resistance.\n\nPsychology Expert: At this point, they're likely to:\n1. Avoid overthinking (as it hasn't helped)\n2. Follow the simplest possible pattern\n3. Return to paper as it represents starting over\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Based on opponent's likely return to paper as a simple pattern completion response\n"
