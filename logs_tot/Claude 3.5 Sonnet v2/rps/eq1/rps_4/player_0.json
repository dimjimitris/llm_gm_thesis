    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and patterns\n3. Statistics Analyst - For tracking and analyzing move probabilities\n4. AI Assistant (me) - For making the final decision based on inputs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, there's no prior history to base decisions on. Game theory suggests that in such scenarios, each move should have an equal probability (1/3) of being chosen to maintain unpredictability.\n\nPsychology Expert: Against a new player, many people tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. However, we shouldn't rely too heavily on this tendency without more data.\n\nStatistics Analyst: Without any previous data, we can only rely on general statistics. Studies have shown that rock is indeed chosen slightly more often as an opening move (~35% of the time), followed by paper (~35%), and scissors (~30%).\n\nGame Strategist: Given this information, paper might be a slightly advantageous opening move as it beats rock, which is statistically favored as a first move. However, we should maintain unpredictability in future rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with the Game Strategist. Paper has a slight psychological advantage as an opening move, and even if we're wrong, the penalty is minimal (-1 point at worst).\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on the collaborative analysis, I'll choose paper as our opening move. It has a slight statistical advantage against the common opening move of rock, while maintaining reasonable safety against scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

They also follow similar strategic thinking\n2. It was a random choice\n3. They might have a specific pattern they follow\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent by predicting what move they think the opponent will switch to. Given that we both played paper, they might expect us to switch to scissors (thinking we'll try to win), and thus they might choose rock to counter that.\n\nStatistics Analyst: Looking at post-tie behavior patterns:\n- Many players tend to stick with their previous move, believing in continuation\n- Others tend to rotate to the next move in the sequence (paper \u2192 scissors)\n- A smaller percentage make a complete change to try to be unpredictable\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest we play rock. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with paper, we lose (-1)\n2. If they switch to scissors (which is common after paper), we win (+1)\n3. If they switch to rock, we tie (0)\n\nPsychology Expert: I disagree slightly. If they're a strategic player (as shown by their paper opening), they might anticipate us thinking this way. I suggest staying with paper to potentially catch them overthinking.\n\nStatistics Analyst: Historical data suggests that after a tie, players switch moves approximately 60% of the time. Of those who switch, the most common pattern is moving to the next move in sequence (paper \u2192 scissors).\n\nAI Assistant (me): After considering all inputs, I'll go with rock. Here's why:\n1. It protects against the most likely move (scissors) based on the sequence progression\n2. It's a good counter to an opponent who might be thinking multiple levels ahead\n3. Even in the worst case (if they stick with paper), we only lose one point\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

This could be:\n1. A strong preference for paper\n2. A deliberate strategy to establish a pattern and break it\n3. Pure coincidence\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has been successful with paper so far (1 win, 1 tie). This might boost their confidence in using paper. However, they might also realize that we'll be expecting paper now, creating a mind game situation. Players who have success with a move sometimes become overconfident and stick to it.\n\nStatistics Analyst: Let's analyze their moves:\nRound 1: Paper (tie)\nRound 2: Paper (win)\nThis shows a consistent pattern of paper usage. When players find success with a strategy, they have roughly a 70% tendency to stick with it at least one more time.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this information, scissors would be the logical counter to their paper pattern. However, they might anticipate this and switch to rock. This is a classic mind game scenario.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychology of winning often makes players more conservative in their next move. Having just won, they might stick with their winning strategy (paper), thinking \"why change what's working?\" Alternatively, they might think we're certain to play scissors to counter their paper streak, and thus switch to rock.\n\nStatistics Analyst: After winning a round, players stick with their winning move approximately 60% of the time. Given their consistent paper usage, this percentage might be even higher.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing all inputs, I'll choose scissors. Here's why:\n1. It directly counters their established pattern of paper usage\n2. Even if they're trying to set up a trap, taking the direct counter is sometimes the best move\n3. The psychological tendency to stick with winning moves supports this decision\n4.

Establish patterns to create expectations\n2. Break patterns at crucial moments\n3. Think ahead of our counters\nThey're now in a confident position with two wins, which might make them more aggressive or more willing to take risks.\n\nStatistics Analyst: Their sequence shows:\nPaper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\nBreaking their pattern at the exact moment we tried to exploit it.

In such situations, sometimes the best strategy is to be deliberately unpredictable rather than trying to outthink the opponent.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their success, they might expect us to be more cautious now. Players who are behind often become more defensive.

Maintain patterns (paper-paper start)\n2. Break patterns strategically (switching to rock when we played scissors)\n3. Return to previous moves (back to paper)\nThis suggests a sophisticated player who might be using multiple-round strategy.\n\nStatistics Analyst: Looking at the pattern after a tie with paper:\n- First time it happened (Round 1\u21922), they stuck with paper\n- Now we're in the same situation again\n- Their overall pattern has been: Paper\u2192Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Paper\nThis could suggest either a cyclical pattern or adaptive strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that history has somewhat repeated itself (paper tie), we need to avoid falling into the same trap as before. Last time after a paper tie, we played rock and lost. We should avoid being predictable based on our own history.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent might be expecting us to avoid repeating our previous mistake (playing rock after a paper tie).

In such mind games, sometimes the most unexpected move is to repeat what you did before.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing all inputs, I'll choose rock. Here's why:\n1.

Some escalate to paper to beat potential repeated rock\n2. Others move to scissors expecting their opponent to play paper\n3. Some stick with rock believing in the power of persistence\nThe opponent has shown they understand these dynamics well.\n\nStatistics Analyst: Looking at their pattern:\nPaper\u2192Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Paper\u2192Rock\nThey seem to alternate between paper-heavy and rock-heavy plays, but haven't used scissors yet. This could be:\n1. A deliberate avoidance of scissors\n2. Setting up for a scissors play\n3. Personal preference against scissors\n\nGame Strategist: The fact that they haven't used scissors at all is significant. Either they're saving it for a crucial moment, or they have a strategic preference against it. After a rock tie, paper is statistically the most common next move.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent might be aware that we've noticed their lack of scissors usage. They could:\n1.

Traditional game theory suggests that in such situations, true randomness might be our best option, as any attempt at strategy has been consistently countered.\n\nPsychology Expert: When facing such a dominant opponent, players often:\n1.

Here's why:\n1. They've just used scissors twice in the last four moves\n2. We're making this choice without trying to over-analyze or find patterns\n3. Rock is traditionally seen as the most stable move\n4.

The opponent has shown no weaknesses or predictable patterns\n2. They've mastered both offensive (winning) and defensive (never losing) play\n3. They might expect us to follow common post-tie patterns\n4. The pressure remains entirely on us at -6 points\n\nStatistics Analyst: Looking at post-rock-tie scenarios in this game:\n- After Round 5's rock tie: They played scissors\n- After Round 1's paper tie: They played paper\n- They've shown they can vary their responses to ties\n- They've never lost a round, only tied or won\n\nGame Strategist: In a situation where standard strategy has failed and we're facing a superior opponent, game theory suggests three possible approaches:\n1. Pure randomness\n2. Extremely simple, fundamental play\n3. Completely unexpected behavior\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent might be:\n1. Expecting us to switch to paper (common after rock tie)\n2. Planning to maintain their perfect record of no losses\n3. Comfortable enough with their lead to take risks\n\nAI Assistant (me): After this analysis, I'll choose scissors. Here's why:\n1. It breaks from the common pattern of playing paper after a rock tie\n2. If they expect us to play paper (the standard counter to rock), they might play scissors, leading to a tie\n3. If they play paper expecting us to stay with rock, we win\n4. At -6 points, we need to take calculated risks\n5.
