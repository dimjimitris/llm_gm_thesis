    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Paper vs Rock: Best reward (+3)\n- Rock vs Scissors: Moderate reward (+1)\n- Scissors vs Paper: Moderate reward (+1)\nThe highest potential reward comes from playing paper if opponent plays rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move against a new player, we have no pattern to analyze yet. However, rock is often a common first move for many players as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at the risk-reward ratio:\n- Paper: +3/-1 (Best reward, moderate risk)\n- Rock: +1/-3 (Moderate reward, highest risk)\n- Scissors: +1/-1 (Moderate reward, lowest risk)\nPaper seems to offer the best risk-reward ratio given the common tendency for rock as a first move.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on the analysis, paper seems to be the optimal first move. It offers the highest potential reward (+3), and protects against the common rock opening. Even if we're wrong, the penalty (-1 against scissors) is manageable.\n\n[move] paper\n"

For the second round, we need to consider possible opponent adaptations:\n1. They might expect us to play paper again and counter with scissors\n2. They might switch to a different move entirely\n3. They might stick with paper hoping we change\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper in the first round, suggesting they're not playing randomly. After a tie, players often try to gain an advantage by predicting their opponent's adaptation.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze our options:\n1. Rock: Safe against potential scissors (+1), but vulnerable to repeated paper (-3)\n2. Paper: Would tie again if they don't change (0), vulnerable to scissors (-1)\n3. Scissors: Good against repeated paper (+1), but vulnerable if they switch to rock (-1)\nGiven the moderate risk and good potential reward, scissors seems like a balanced choice.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the analysis. Since our opponent showed strategic thinking with paper in the first round, they're likely to either stick with paper (thinking we'll change) or switch to scissors (thinking we'll play paper again). Scissors gives us a good chance against paper and ties with scissors, with only a moderate downside against rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The highest value play here would be paper, as it beats rock and has a manageable downside.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree that paper is our best move here. The opponent has shown they can think strategically, and after a successful rock play, they might:\n1. Stick with rock (thinking it's working)\n2.

While there's a possibility they're following a clockwise rotation (suggesting paper next), they've been very good at anticipating our moves.

Somehow able to see our move before finalizing theirs\n2. Using an extremely accurate prediction system\n3. Deliberately mirroring to maintain their advantage\n\nIn this case, our usual strategic considerations might be less relevant than dealing with this mirroring behavior. We need to either:\n1.
