    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding opponent psychology and patterns\n3. Strategic Advisor - For overall game planning\n4. Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when it wins against rock, while having minimal loss (-1) when losing to scissors. This asymmetric payoff structure is interesting.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they might go with the most common opening move. Studies show rock is often chosen as the first move by players, as it represents strength and stability.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the payoff structure, paper would be optimal here - it gives us the highest upside (3 points) if opponent chooses rock, and minimal downside (-1) if they choose scissors.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with the analysis. Paper appears to be the best strategic choice considering both the game theory and psychological aspects. It offers the best risk-reward ratio for an opening move.\n\nGame Theorist: Just to confirm - if opponent plays rock, we get 3 points. If they play scissors, we lose 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie (0 points). The expected value seems positive.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper This move offers the best combination of high potential reward and limited downside risk.\n"

After a tie, players often try to outsmart their opponent by predicting what they think the opponent will do next. Many players assume their opponent will change their move after a tie.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that both players chose paper, there might be a tendency for the opponent to switch to scissors, thinking we might stick with paper. This would follow basic pattern-breaking behavior.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we assume they might switch to scissors to beat our previous paper move, we should consider playing rock. This would give us the best defensive position against scissors, with potential for a 1-point gain.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The psychology here is key. The opponent might be thinking multiple levels deep - \"they think I'll play scissors, so they'll play rock, so I should play paper.\" However, we shouldn't overcomplicate it. Rock provides a solid defensive play with reasonable upside.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree with playing rock. It protects against the most likely counter-move (scissors) while maintaining a reasonable position even if they stick with paper or switch to rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: The downside of rock is losing 3 points to paper, but given the previous round and likely psychology, this seems like an acceptable risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the opponent's likely shift in strategy after a tie and the need to protect against scissors.\n"

They might expect us to continue our pattern of changing moves.\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent has lost points and might play more aggressively now. They might go for paper to try to get the maximum 3 points against rock, assuming we might stick with our winning move.\n\nStrategic Advisor: If they expect us to stick with rock (a common behavior after winning), they'll likely play paper. However, if they think we're pattern players (paper -> rock -> scissors), they might expect scissors from us and play rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Players often try to maximize points after falling behind. The high-reward paper play against rock would be tempting for them.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given this analysis, scissors would be our safest play. If they go for the aggressive paper play, we win 1 point. If they try to counter our expected scissors with rock, we only lose 1 point. It's the most balanced risk-reward option.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Agreed.

Extremely good at reading our strategy\n2. Using similar logical patterns\n3.

The \"obvious\" move of paper to beat rock might be exactly what they're expecting and preparing to counter.\n\nStrategic Advisor: We need to break this cycle decisively. Since paper would be the conventional choice after rock, and scissors would counter that paper, many would expect scissors. Therefore, staying with rock might catch them off guard.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: However, given the pattern of ties, it's clear that matching our logic has been successful for them. We need to do something unexpected.\n\nGame Theorist: The optimal strategy here is to make the move they'd least expect.

If the opponent is matching our logical process, we need to do something that defies logic entirely.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, when faced with an opponent who perfectly matches your moves, the optimal strategy might be to choose the move that seems most irrational or counter-intuitive.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After paper-paper tie, conventional wisdom would suggest:\n- Don't play paper again (just tied)\n- Play scissors (to beat expected paper)\n- Play rock (to beat expected scissors)\n\nRisk Analyst: Since our opponent seems to match our strategic thinking, we should make the move that has the least strategic justification.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The most counter-intuitive move right now would be to stick with paper. It's the move that:\n1. Just resulted in a tie\n2. No rational player would expect\n3. Defies all strategic logic\n4. Has no game theory justification\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. By playing paper again, we're making a move so apparently illogical that it might break the pattern of our opponent matching our strategic thinking.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychology of repeating the same move after six consecutive ties and a paper-paper tie is so unusual that it might be our best chance to break the pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Making an intentionally counter-intuitive move by sticking with paper, defying conventional strategy in an attempt to break our opponent's ability to match our logical process.\n"

Complete history:\nRound 1-9: Six consecutive ties\nRound 10: Paper vs Rock (won, +3)\nTotal: +5 points\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is a crucial moment:\n1. We finally broke the tie streak with our counter-intuitive play\n2. The opponent's rock move suggests they finally deviated from matching us\n3. They just lost significantly (-3 points), which will affect their psychology\n4. This is a major shift in game dynamics\n\nRisk Analyst: After losing 3 points, the opponent is likely to:\n1. Feel pressure to recover points\n2. Be more aggressive in their play\n3. Be less likely to play rock again after a significant loss\n4. Possibly revert to trying to match our moves again\n\nStrategic Advisor: The success of our \"irrational\" strategy is interesting, but we shouldn't assume it will work again. The opponent has now seen this tactic.\n\nGame Theorist: After a major point loss, players often:\n1. Avoid the move they just lost with (rock)\n2. Try to maximize potential points to recover\n3. Attempt to predict if their opponent will repeat their winning strategy\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological impact of breaking both the tie streak and suffering a 3-point loss will likely make them play more emotionally rather than logically.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze their likely moves:\n- Paper: Possible if they think we'll repeat our winning paper play\n- Scissors: Most likely as it beats paper and shows aggression\n- Rock: Least likely after just losing with it\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given their likely emotional state and need to recover points, scissors would be their most probable move - it counters our previous winning paper play and shows aggressive intent to recover.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. The opponent is most likely to play scissors to counter our successful paper play.

Three consecutive losses - our longest losing streak\n2. They've completely reversed the game momentum\n3. They're reading our moves perfectly\n4. Our attempts to be unpredictable have failed\n5. We might be entering our own tilt state\n\nRisk Analyst: Danger signs:\n1. Every strategic adjustment has been countered\n2. Our points lead has been significantly reduced\n3. Opponent showing masterful adaptation\n4. Our decision-making may be compromised\n\nStrategic Advisor: We need to acknowledge that:\n1. The opponent has completely solved our strategy\n2. They're successfully predicting our adaptations\n3. They're controlling the game flow\n4. We need a fundamental strategy reset\n\nGame Theorist: In situations of consecutive losses, we need to consider:\n1. Return to basic game theory\n2. Avoid overthinking\n3. Break the pattern of predictability\n4. Reset our mental state\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: When players face multiple consecutive losses, the best approach is often to:\n1. Simplify decision-making\n2. Return to fundamentals\n3. Avoid emotional responses\n4. Make a \"reset\" move\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock offers several advantages as a reset move:\n1. Most basic and fundamental move\n2. Psychologically grounding\n3. Strong against likely aggressive play\n4. Helps break overthinking cycle\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with the reset approach. Rock provides:\n1. Mental reset opportunity\n2. Protection against likely aggressive scissors play\n3. Break from our recent paper-scissors pattern\n4. Return to fundamental strategy\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent might expect us to:\n1. Continue trying complex counter-strategies\n2. Play emotionally\n3. Attempt to maximize points to recover losses\nBut a simple, fundamental play might catch them off guard.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Making a fundamental \"reset\" move to break our negative pattern and return to basic strategy while protecting against likely aggressive play.\n"
