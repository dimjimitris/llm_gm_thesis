    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock gives highest reward (3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give lower reward (1 point)\n   - Corresponding losses are -3 and -1 points\n\n3. Since I have no information about the opponent:\n   - I should avoid risky moves that could result in -3 points\n   - Paper is risky because if opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - Rock is risky because if opponent plays paper, I lose 3 points\n   - Scissors is risky because if opponent plays rock, I lose 1 point\n\n4. Given equal uncertainty about opponent's move:\n   - I should choose a move that balances potential gains and losses\n   - Scissors has moderate risk (-1 if lose) and moderate reward (1 if win)\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Scissors offers balanced risk-reward ratio\n   - It avoids the potential for maximum loss (-3 points)\n   - Can win against paper (1 point) or tie against scissors (0 points)\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Strategy adjustment:\n   - If opponent is likely to play rock, I should counter with paper\n   - This would give me the maximum possible points (3)\n   - Even if I'm wrong and they play scissors, I only risk -1 point\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing paper:\n     * Wins against rock (3 points)\n     * Loses to scissors (-1 point)\n     * Ties with paper (0 points)\n   - The potential reward outweighs the risk\n\n5.
