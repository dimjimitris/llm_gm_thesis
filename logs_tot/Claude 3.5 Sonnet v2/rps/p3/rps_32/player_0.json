    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the payoff structure:\n   * Paper vs Rock: Highest reward (3 points)\n   * Rock vs Scissors: Lower reward (1 point)\n   * Scissors vs Paper: Lower reward (1 point)\n\n3. Since paper offers the highest potential reward (3 points), it might be worth the risk despite potentially losing 1 point if opponent plays scissors.\n\n4. Given no information about the opponent:\n   * Rock is a safe middle option\n   * Paper gives highest reward potential\n   * Scissors has same risk/reward as rock\n\n5. For the first move, I'll choose paper because:\n   * It has the highest potential reward\n   * In first rounds, many players choose rock as a \"safe\" opening move\n   * Even if I lose, the penalty (-1 for losing to scissors) is smaller than the potential gain (+3 for beating rock)\n\n[move] paper\n"

Psychological factors:\n   * After a tie, players often look to break the deadlock decisively\n   * Opponent has shown they eventually break patterns\n   * They might expect me to play scissors to beat their paper\n   * The game has entered a more sophisticated phase\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   * If they expect scissors from me, they'll play rock\n   * If they think I'll stick with paper, they'll play scissors\n   * If they think I'm overthinking, they might stay with paper\n   * The mind game has deepened significantly\n\n5. Decision:\n   * I'll play rock because:\n     - It beats scissors if they return to their familiar move\n     - It beats scissors if they expect me to play scissors against their paper\n     - If they stick with paper, I lose 3 points, but that's a calculated risk\n     - This move protects against the most likely scenarios while maintaining offensive potential\n     - The opponent has shown a tendency to return to scissors under pressure\n\n[move] rock\n"
