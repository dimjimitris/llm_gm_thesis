They played paper instead of rock after losing with paper (breaking their usual pattern)\n2. They've been mixing up their responses to losses lately\n3. After a paper tie, they might:\n   - Switch to scissors to counter expected paper\n   - Switch to rock expecting me to play scissors\n   - Stay with paper hoping to catch me switching to rock\n\nGiven:\n- Their recent unpredictability\n- Their tendency to make strong counter-moves after ties\n- Their success with scissors against my paper plays\n\nI think they might switch to scissors to counter an expected paper play, so I'll counter with:\n\n[move] rock\n"

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
