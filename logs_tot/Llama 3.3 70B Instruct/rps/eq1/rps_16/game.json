Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The game is rock-paper-scissors, with rock beating scissors, paper beating rock, and scissors beating paper.\n2. Since this is the first round, I have no information about the other player's strategy or tendencies.\n3. I need to choose a move that has a chance of winning, but also consider the potential for a tie.\n4. A common starting strategy is to choose a move that is not too predictable, such as rock, which is often a popular first choice.\n5. However, since the other player has already made their move, I can try to make an educated guess about their potential choice.\n6. Assuming the other player may choose rock as a common starting move, I can choose a move that beats rock, which is paper.\n\n[move] (Choosing paper as it beats rock, a potential common starting move) paper\n",

Since this is the first round and the other player is fresh, there's no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n3. A common approach in such situations is to choose a move randomly or go with a default strategy.\n4. One default strategy could be to choose the move that has an equal chance of winning or losing against any other move, if such a move exists.\n5. However, in rock-paper-scissors, each move has a unique relationship with the other two moves (rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper), so there isn't a single move that is equally advantageous against all other moves.\n6. Given the lack of information about the opponent's strategy, a reasonable initial approach could be to select a move that the opponent might least expect or to choose randomly.\n7.
