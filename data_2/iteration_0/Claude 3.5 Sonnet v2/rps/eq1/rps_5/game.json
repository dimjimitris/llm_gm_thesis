Analyzing the pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: Both chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - My opponent seems to be making the same moves as me, suggesting either:\n     a) They're following similar logical reasoning\n     b) They might be deliberately matching my moves\n     c) Pure coincidence (becoming less likely with each matching move)\n\n2. Psychology assessment:\n   - Two ties in a row creates pressure to break the pattern\n   - My opponent might be recognizing the mirroring pattern\n   - They might either:\n     a) Try to predict and counter my next move\n     b) Continue matching if they're deliberately doing so\n\n3. Strategic consideration:\n   - If they're deliberately matching, they'll need my previous move to match it\n   - If I change my strategy significantly, it might break their pattern\n   - After rock, common tendency is to stay with rock (perceived as strong) or switch to paper (to beat expected rock)\n\n4. Decision reasoning:\n   - To break the potential matching pattern, I should make a less predictable move\n   - If they're expecting me to play paper (to beat previous rock), they might play scissors\n   - If they're trying to match again, they'll play scissors if they can predict it\n\n5.

Psychological analysis:\n   - Opponent just lost with scissors\n   - After a loss, players often:\n     a) Switch strategies completely\n     b) Try to predict what made them lose and counter it\n     c) Sometimes stubbornly repeat their move believing in probability turning in their favor\n\n3.

Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent has shown a tendency to match my moves (3 out of 4 rounds)\n   - The only time they didn't match was when they lost\n   - The matching could be:\n     a) Intentional copying strategy\n     b) Similar strategic thinking\n     c) Using similar psychological reasoning\n\n3.

Psychological state:\n   - Opponent is likely:\n     a) Confident after two successful rounds\n     b) Feeling they've \"figured out\" my strategy\n     c) More likely to be aggressive\n   - I need to avoid being predictable\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - They've won with both rock and paper recently\n   - They might expect me to:\n     a) Play paper to beat their potential rock\n     b) Play scissors to beat their recent paper\n     c) Play rock as a \"safe\" move\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Scissors is the optimal choice because:\n     - They're likely to stick with paper after success\n     - Their growing confidence might make them stick to winning moves\n     - Even if they predict this and play rock, we're still ahead overall\n     - Need to break their momentum\n     - Playing conservatively now could lead to more losses\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Recent game history:\n   * Last 6 rounds:\n     - Rock vs Rock (tie)\n     - Paper vs Scissors (lost)\n     - Scissors vs Paper (won)\n     - Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n     - Paper vs Rock (won)\n     - Rock vs Paper (lost)\n   * Still at -2 points\n   * Game showing alternating patterns of decisive moves and ties\n\n2. Pattern analysis from Rock-Rock tie:\n   * Earlier Rock-Rock ties led to:\n     - Both players sometimes maintaining Rock\n     - One player sometimes switching to Paper\n     - Winner usually being who read the switch correctly\n   * This opponent specifically:\n     - Often uses ties to set up wins\n     - Shows patience in tie situations\n     - Makes strong reads after ties\n\n3. Psychological dynamics:\n   * Rock-Rock tie suggests:\n     - Both players thinking similarly\n     - Both playing conservatively\n     - Building tension for next move\n   * Opponent has historically:\n     - Used ties strategically\n     - Made strong plays after ties\n     - Punished predictable switches\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   * If both maintain Rock: Another tie\n   * If I switch to Paper and they stay Rock: I win\n   * If I switch to Paper and they switch to Scissors: I lose\n   * If I maintain Rock and they switch to Paper: I lose\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * Opponent excels at punishing obvious switches\n   * They've shown patience in similar situations\n   * Maintaining Rock would be:\n     - Less predictable than switching to Paper\n     - Safe against Scissors if they get aggressive\n     - Only vulnerable to the obvious Paper counter\n   * Given their sophisticated play, they might avoid obvious Paper switch\n   * Rock maintains pressure while forcing them to make the aggressive move\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Rock Maintaining position to force opponent into making the first aggressive move\n"

Recent game history:\n   * Last 6 rounds:\n     - Rock vs Scissors (won!)\n     - Rock vs Rock (tie)\n     - Paper vs Scissors (lost)\n     - Scissors vs Paper (won)\n     - Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n     - Paper vs Rock (won)\n   * Score improved to -1 point\n   * Rock has been successful twice recently\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   * My recent Rock strategy:\n     - First forced a tie\n     - Then won against Scissors\n   * Opponent's recent plays:\n     - Scissors (lost)\n     - Rock (tie)\n     - Scissors (won)\n     * Shows they favor Scissors lately\n\n3. Psychological dynamics:\n   * I have momentum after win\n   * Opponent just lost with Scissors\n   * They likely expect me to:\n     - Either maintain winning Rock\n     - Or switch to Paper anticipating their Rock counter\n   * They're probably thinking:\n     - Need to break my Rock success\n     - Avoid Scissors after losing to Rock\n     - Counter my potential confidence\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * After losing to Rock, opponents typically:\n     - Switch to Paper to beat expected repeated Rock\n     - Switch to Rock as safe play\n     - Rarely return to Scissors that just lost\n   * But this opponent has shown:\n     - Sophisticated thinking\n     - Ability to make unexpected plays\n     - Good reads of obvious counters\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   * Maintaining Rock would be predictable\n   * Switching to Paper is what they expect\n   * Scissors would:\n     - Beat Paper if they make obvious Rock counter\n     - Beat Paper if they try to counter expected Rock\n     - Only lose to Rock, which they just lost with\n     - Be unexpected after my Rock success\n   * This is an aggressive but calculated risk\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Scissors Taking calculated aggressive action to counter expected Paper\n"
