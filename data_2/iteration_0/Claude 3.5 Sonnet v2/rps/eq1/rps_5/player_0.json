    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In such a situation with no prior information, any move is strategically equivalent.\n\n5.

Decision reasoning:\n   - Since I predict opponent might switch to scissors to beat my previous paper\n   - Rock would be the optimal counter to their predicted scissors\n\n5.

Analyzing the pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: Both chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - My opponent seems to be making the same moves as me, suggesting either:\n     a) They're following similar logical reasoning\n     b) They might be deliberately matching my moves\n     c) Pure coincidence (becoming less likely with each matching move)\n\n2. Psychology assessment:\n   - Two ties in a row creates pressure to break the pattern\n   - My opponent might be recognizing the mirroring pattern\n   - They might either:\n     a) Try to predict and counter my next move\n     b) Continue matching if they're deliberately doing so\n\n3. Strategic consideration:\n   - If they're deliberately matching, they'll need my previous move to match it\n   - If I change my strategy significantly, it might break their pattern\n   - After rock, common tendency is to stay with rock (perceived as strong) or switch to paper (to beat expected rock)\n\n4. Decision reasoning:\n   - To break the potential matching pattern, I should make a less predictable move\n   - If they're expecting me to play paper (to beat previous rock), they might play scissors\n   - If they're trying to match again, they'll play scissors if they can predict it\n\n5.

Psychological analysis:\n   - Opponent just lost with scissors\n   - After a loss, players often:\n     a) Switch strategies completely\n     b) Try to predict what made them lose and counter it\n     c) Sometimes stubbornly repeat their move believing in probability turning in their favor\n\n3.

Current game state assessment:\n   - We're back to matching moves\n   - Opponent has only scored once\n   - The game has become more conservative\n   - Both players seem to be playing more cautiously\n\n3. Pattern recognition:\n   - Opponent appears to:\n     a) Be comfortable with ties\n     b) Be less predictable than during their losing streak\n     c) Either intentionally matching or thinking similarly\n     d) Have found stability in their play\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they're matching: They'll play paper\n   - If they're trying to win: They'll play scissors\n   - If they're playing conservatively: They might return to rock\n   - The recent tie might encourage them to try breaking the pattern\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Rock is the optimal choice because:\n     - Most players will try scissors to beat repeated paper\n     - Opponent might try to capitalize on their previous rock success\n     - If they match with rock, a tie is acceptable\n     - We're ahead enough to take calculated risks\n     - Their most logical move is scissors to beat expected paper repetition\n\n[move] rock\n"

Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Last 5 rounds:\n     * Won (scissors vs paper)\n     * Tie (both rock)\n     * Lost (scissors vs rock)\n   - Opponent successfully:\n     a) Stayed with rock instead of switching\n     b) Punished my aggressive scissors play\n     c) Showed patience in their strategy\n\n2. Pattern recognition:\n   - Opponent demonstrating:\n     a) Strong defensive play\n     b) Willingness to stick with successful moves\n     c) Good reads on my aggressive tendencies\n     d) Effective use of rock as a safe option\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - Opponent likely feeling:\n     a) Confident after winning with rock\n     b) Comfortable with conservative play\n     c) Successfully reading my aggressive style\n   - I'm possibly:\n     a) Being too aggressive\n     b) Becoming predictable in my counters\n     c) Need to show more patience\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - After winning with rock, they might:\n     a) Stick with rock after success\n     b) Expect me to play paper to counter rock\n     c) Switch to paper themselves expecting my rock\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Paper is the optimal choice because:\n     - High probability they stay with rock:\n       * Just worked for them\n       * Is their comfort move\n       * Has been effective against my aggression\n     - Need to directly counter their successful strategy\n     - More conservative approach needed\n     - Even if they predict this and play scissors, worth the risk to break their momentum\n\n[move] paper\n"
