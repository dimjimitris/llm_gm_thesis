    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For identifying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In such cases, game theory suggests that we should consider a balanced approach. Each move has equal chances of winning, losing, or tying.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move, we can't rely on pattern recognition yet. However, psychological studies suggest that 'rock' is often a common first move choice for many players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\nRisk Manager: Given that:\n1. We have no historical data\n2. Rock is a common first move\n3. Paper beats rock\n4. If they don't choose rock, we have equal chances of winning or losing\n\nI would suggest choosing paper as our first move. It gives us an advantage if they choose the statistically common 'rock' move, and in other cases, we have a balanced risk.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with this analysis. Paper provides a good strategic opening that counters the most common first move while maintaining reasonable risk levels against other possibilities.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on our collaborative analysis, I'll proceed with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now, for the second round, we need to consider that the opponent might:\n1. Change their strategy after losing\n2. Expect us to play paper again\n3. Try to counter our previous winning move\n\nPattern Analyzer: Indeed, after losing to paper, many players would naturally want to counter with scissors to prevent the same loss. This is a common psychological pattern in this game - players tend to switch to the move that would have beaten their opponent's previous move.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze our options:\n1. If we play paper again: High risk as opponent likely to switch to scissors\n2. If we play scissors: Medium risk - could win if they switch to paper, lose if they switch to rock\n3. If we play rock: Could win if they switch to scissors as predicted, and reasonable against other moves\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing rock. It's a strong counter to the most likely opponent adaptation (scissors), and maintains reasonable outcomes against other possibilities. The opponent is likely trying to counter our previous success, making scissors their most probable move.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis makes sense.

Round 2: They played scissors (trying to beat our paper), lost to our rock\nThe opponent is showing a pattern of trying to counter our previous move, but we've been one step ahead.\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has lost twice now. This often leads to either:\n1. Frustration and more predictable play (trying to counter our last move again)\n2. A complete strategy change to break their losing streak\n3. Returning to their \"comfort move\" (which was rock in round 1)\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated tendency to counter our previous move, they might expect us to stick with our winning rock and thus play paper. However, they might also realize we've been predicting their moves and try something unexpected.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological pressure of two losses might make them return to their initial \"comfort move\" of rock. Players often revert to their first instinct when under pressure.\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend playing paper again. Here's why:\n1. It beats rock if they return to their comfort move\n2. It's not what they would expect after our rock play\n3. Even if they play scissors, we've already won two rounds, so we can afford some risk\n\nGame Strategist: I agree.

Round 3: They played rock \u2192 lost to our paper\nThey've shown a clear pattern: after losing with scissors, they reverted to their comfort move (rock).\n\nRisk Manager: This is a critical moment.

Intense focus and analysis of our pattern (they might notice we've alternated between paper and rock)\n\nGame Strategist: Indeed, and they might have finally noticed that we've used paper twice successfully against their rock. They're likely to either:\n1. Finally adapt and use scissors to counter our paper plays\n2.

Complete pattern break and using their unused move (paper)\n2. Random emotional play\n3. Continuing their pattern due to stress-induced tunnel vision\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given human psychology, after four losses, players often try something completely different. Paper is the only move they haven't used yet, making it increasingly likely they'll choose it.\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend scissors for this round:\n1.

Both players showing sophisticated strategy\n\nGame Strategist: After a rock tie, considering late game psychology:\n1. Players often try to break tie sequences decisively\n2. The pressure to make winning moves increases\n3. The tendency to overthink increases\n4. Some revert to basic patterns under pressure\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at their historical patterns:\n1. After rock ties, they've often switched to paper\n2. Late game has shown increased strategic depth\n3. They've shown ability to make unexpected moves\n4. Their early game patterns are less relevant now\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend playing scissors:\n1. It counters their likely paper play after rock tie\n2. Paper has been a common choice for them after rock\n3. They've shown willingness to use paper strategically\n4. We can afford some risk with our 6-point lead\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. The late game situation and their demonstrated strategic growth suggest they're likely to use paper to try to break the tie sequence. Scissors gives us the best chance to counter this and potentially extend our lead.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis is sound, particularly regarding their likely use of paper to break the tie sequence in this late game situation.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
