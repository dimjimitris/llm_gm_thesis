    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern consideration:\n   * Success came from unexpected repetition\n   * Previous wins often followed by opponent's strong counter\n   * Need to stay ahead of their adaptation\n   * Can't become predictable after success\n\n5. Win-follow strategy:\n   * Conventional: stick with winning move\n   * Semi-conventional: switch to counter expected counter\n   * Unconventional: completely unexpected move\n   * Must consider opponent's strong adaptive ability\n\n6. Decision:\n   * If they expect paper again - they'll play scissors\n   * If they expect me to switch to rock - they'll play paper\n   * If they expect me to play scissors - they'll play rock\n   * Best move is rock:\n      * Protects against potential scissors counter\n      * Shows ability to shift strategy after success\n      * Maintains unpredictable playing style\n      * Different from previous post-win patterns\n\n[move] rock (Strategic shift after success to maintain unpredictability)\n"

Recent sequence:\n   * Round 20: Tie (scissors vs scissors)\n   * Round 21: Tie (paper vs paper)\n   * Round 22: Win (paper vs rock)\n   * Round 23: Win (rock vs scissors)\n   * Score: -5 points\n   * Two consecutive wins!\n\n2. Momentum analysis:\n   * First time achieving two consecutive wins\n   * Successfully broke out of tie sequence\n   * Showing strong strategic adaptation\n   * Building significant momentum\n\n3. Pattern success:\n   * Unpredictable moves leading to wins\n   * Paper win followed by rock win\n   * Breaking expected patterns working well\n   * Opponent seems to be misreading my strategy\n\n4. Psychological edge:\n   * I have momentum advantage\n   * Opponent has lost twice in a row\n   * They might be more aggressive to stop streak\n   * They might be questioning their prediction model\n\n5. Opponent's likely response:\n   * They need to break my winning streak\n   * They might return to their earlier dominant strategies\n   * They might expect me to be overconfident\n   * They might make a bold move to regain control\n\n6. Decision:\n   * If they expect rock again - they'll play paper\n   * If they expect paper to repeat earlier win - they'll play scissors\n   * If they're playing aggressively - they might use rock\n   * Best move is scissors:\n      * Completely different from last two winning moves\n      * Counters paper if they try to beat rock\n      * Shows confidence to maintain aggression\n      * Maintains unpredictable sequence (paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors)\n\n[move] scissors (Maintaining aggressive momentum while staying unpredictable)\n"
