You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This is a strong comeback from being at -8 earlier. The opponent tried scissors, perhaps expecting me to use paper again after my previous successes with it. This shows they're trying to counter my moves again rather than mirror them. Since I just beat their scissors with rock, they might expect me to stick with rock and counter with paper. Or they might expect me to try paper again since it gave me +3 points twice recently. I'll use scissors - keeping my strategy unpredictable has been working well in this comeback phase.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The opponent used paper, perhaps trying to beat my recent successful rock play, but fell into my scissors. I've managed to win with all three moves during this comeback (paper for +3 twice, rock for +1, and now scissors for +1). The opponent has shown they can adapt their strategy significantly (from countering to mirroring and back), so they're likely to adjust after these losses. Since I just won with scissors, they might use rock to counter it. I'll use paper, which would beat their rock and has been my most successful move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This feels like a crucial moment in the game - we're back at exactly even score, and they might be regaining momentum.

After winning with paper, they might expect me to try paper myself to counter their anticipated rock. Or they might stick with paper after this big win. I need to avoid being predictable, but also protect against another big loss.
