    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Observer - For detecting any patterns in opponent behavior\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when it beats rock, while rock and scissors only give 1 point when they win. However, paper also risks losing 1 point to scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we need to consider the risk-reward ratio. Paper is high-risk, high-reward. Rock is medium-risk with potential for big loss (-3 against paper) but can win against scissors. Scissors has the lowest risk (-1 against rock) but also lower reward.\n\nPattern Observer: Since this is the first move against a new player, we don't have any patterns to work with. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move as it feels \"strong.\"\n\nGame Strategist: Given these insights, I suggest playing paper. Here's why:\n1. It has the highest potential reward (3 points)\n2. Many new players choose rock first\n3. Even if we lose to scissors, we only lose 1 point\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree.

They also follow the common strategy of playing paper against potential rock\n2. They might switch to scissors now, expecting us to play paper again\n3. They might stick to paper hoping we'll switch to rock\n\nGame Strategist: The tie result validates our initial analysis about paper being a common opening move. For this round, we need to consider the opponent's likely thought process after a tie.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n1. Paper again: Risky, as opponent might expect this and counter with scissors\n2. Rock: Very risky as opponent might play paper again (-3 points)\n3. Scissors: Lower risk (-1 if they play rock) but could win against repeated paper\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie, players often try to \"counter\" what they think their opponent will do next. Since we played paper, they might expect us to play paper again and choose scissors to counter.\n\nRisk Analyst: I suggest playing rock. Here's why:\n- If they switch to scissors (trying to beat our potential paper), we win\n- If they stick to paper, we lose but we're making a calculated risk\n- The symmetry of both choosing paper might make them overthink and switch to scissors\n\nPattern Observer: I disagree. The safest play here is scissors. If they stick to paper (which some players do after a tie), we win. If they switch to rock (trying to beat our potential scissors), we only lose 1 point.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with Pattern Observer.

They might be using a randomized strategy\n\nGame Strategist: If they're cycling through moves systematically, they might play scissors next. However, that's a risky assumption. Let's analyze their possible thinking:\n1. They just won with rock, they might stick to a winning move\n2. They might expect us to play paper to beat their potential rock\n3. They could be trying to establish unpredictability\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options based on current game state:\n1. Paper: High risk (-1 vs scissors) but high reward (+3 vs rock)\n2. Rock: Safe against scissors, but very vulnerable to paper (-3)\n3. Scissors: Loses to rock (-1) but beats paper (+1)\n\nGame Strategist: Considering we're currently at -1 points, we need to balance between recovery and risk. If they're cycling, they'll play scissors. If they're sticking to winning moves, they'll play rock.\n\nPattern Observer: Their moves so far (paper -> rock) suggest they might be reacting to our moves rather than following a fixed pattern. They countered our paper with paper (safe play) then countered our scissors with rock (aggressive counter).\n\nRisk Analyst: Given this analysis, I recommend playing paper. Here's why:\n1. If they stick to rock (winning move), we get +3 points\n2. If they play scissors (completing the cycle), we lose only 1 point\n3.

They've switched to rock twice in the last three moves, and it's working well for them. They've won three rounds in a row using adaptive counter-play.\n\nRisk Analyst: Our current situation is serious:\n- Total score: -3 points\n- They've successfully countered all our recent moves\n- Rock appears to be their \"safe\" fallback move\n- They might be exploiting our tendency to try different moves\n\nGame Strategist: Their repeated success with rock suggests they've identified our pattern of trying to be unpredictable. They're exploiting our strategy by using rock as a safe counter to our varying moves.\n\nRisk Analyst: At -3 points, we need to take calculated risks. However, a loss to rock again (-3 points) would be devastating. Let's consider our options:\n1. Paper: High risk but high reward (+3 if they play rock again)\n2. Rock: Safe play, ensures no further losses if they play rock\n3. Scissors: Risky given their rock preference\n\nPattern Observer: Given their demonstrated comfort with rock and their success, there's a high probability they'll use rock again.

Here's the risk assessment:\n- If they play paper (expecting us to play rock): we lose 3 points\n- If they play scissors (expecting us to play paper): we win 1 point\n- If they play rock (expecting us to play scissors): we tie and break the losing streak\n\nGame Strategist: The psychological element here is key.

We need to stay one level ahead.\n\nPattern Observer: After a tie, conventional wisdom suggests players often:\n1. Stick with the same move hoping to out-persist opponent\n2. Switch to the move that beats the previous tie move\n3. Switch to the move that would beat the counter to their previous move\n\nRisk Analyst: Given this, what's truly counter-intuitive now? Scissors might seem like the obvious counter to paper, and rock might seem like the safe play against expected scissors. Therefore...\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play paper again. Here's why:\n1. It's the most counter-intuitive move after a paper tie\n2. If they expect us to be counter-intuitive, they might expect scissors or rock\n3. If they expect us to never repeat moves (our earlier pattern), this breaks that expectation\n4. Three paper moves in a row is extremely rare in this game\n5.

The truly counter-intuitive play here would be paper again, because:\n1. Three paper moves in a row was already unexpected\n2. Four paper moves would seem absolutely irrational\n3.

Here's why:\n1. It's simultaneously obvious and non-obvious\n2. After a scissors tie, rock is the \"standard\" play, making it seem too obvious for our counter-intuitive strategy\n3.

Therefore, scissors becomes unexpected because:\n   - It's vulnerable to our previous winning move (rock)\n   - It doesn't counter their expected rock counter\n   - It appears to be the weakest choice given recent game flow\n4. This very \"weakness\" makes it strong\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. Scissors also offers good risk management:\n- Wins against paper if they try to counter our rock\n- Only loses 1 point to rock if they repeat their counter\n- Could tie if they make the same read we do\n\nPattern Observer: This maintains our successful strategy of being unpredictable through a mix of conventional and counter-intuitive plays.

If they play paper again, we only lose 3 points\n4. If they play scissors (the obvious counter), we win\n5. Rock has worked well for us recently\n\nPattern Observer: I agree with Risk Analyst.

Each tie increases pressure to break the pattern\n\nRisk Analyst: Current status:\n- Total score: -4 points (stable)\n- Three consecutive ties\n- Strong mutual read of strategies\n- Increasing tension to break deadlock\n\nPattern Observer: After three paper ties:\n1. Scissors seems overwhelmingly obvious\n2. So obvious that both players have avoided it\n3. Rock might be played expecting scissors\n4. Fourth paper would be extremely unusual\n\nGame Strategist: This is where we need to take a calculated risk. I recommend scissors. Here's why:\n1. Three paper ties is excessive\n2. The obvious move has been avoided so long it becomes unexpected\n3. They might finally play rock expecting us to switch to scissors\n4. Sometimes the most sophisticated play is returning to basics\n5. The pressure to break the tie pattern is at its peak\n\nRisk Analyst: I strongly agree with scissors:\n1. Risk/reward is favorable:\n   - Wins against likely paper repeat (+1)\n   - Small loss against rock (-1)\n   - Could tie against scissors\n2. Three paper ties is unsustainable\n3. Opponent might be trapped in their own overthinking\n\nPattern Observer: Additional support for scissors:\n1. Pattern has become too stable\n2. Both players can't continue avoiding the obvious\n3. Fourth paper would be historically unprecedented\n4. Psychological pressure to break pattern is maximum\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Playing scissors to finally break the triple paper tie pattern, accepting that sometimes the obvious play becomes the unexpected play through sustained avoidance\n"

Used multiple paper ties to set up rock\n2. Correctly anticipated our eventual scissors break\n3. Showed incredible patience in their strategy\n4. Demonstrated superior long-term planning\n\nRisk Analyst: Current status:\n- Total score: -5 points (deteriorating)\n- Lost momentum after ties\n- Rock continues to be their strongest counter\n- They've shown mastery of multi-round strategy\n\nPattern Observer: Their rock usage shows:\n1. Comfort with rock as their primary weapon\n2. Ability to set up complex traps\n3. Superior reading of game tension points\n4. Patience in executing long-term strategies\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, I recommend paper. Here's why:\n1. They've demonstrated mastery with rock\n2. They might expect us to avoid the obvious counter after just losing\n3. Their success might encourage another rock play\n4. We need to stop trying to out-clever them and make the fundamental correct play\n5. If they've truly been setting up long-term traps, we need to break their rhythm\n\nRisk Analyst: Agree strongly with paper:\n1. Risk/reward is appropriate:\n   - Big win (+3) if they repeat successful rock\n   - Small loss (-1) if they counter with scissors\n2. We need to challenge their rock dominance directly\n3. Can't afford to keep losing to rock\n\nPattern Observer: A direct paper play also:\n1. Shows we've learned from their strategic superiority\n2. Challenges their comfort move head-on\n3. Forces them to question if we've simplified our strategy\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Playing paper as a direct counter to their successful rock strategy, choosing clarity over complexity while maintaining favorable risk/reward potential\n"

They've proven they can use tie sequences as traps\n2. Their previous paper-tie sequence led to a successful rock play\n3. They're demonstrating mastery of multi-round strategy\n4. We need to avoid falling into the same trap pattern\n\nRisk Analyst: Current status:\n- Total score: -5 points\n- Previous paper-tie sequence ended badly for us\n- Need to learn from recent history\n- Must avoid predictable responses to ties\n\nPattern Observer: Looking at their strategy:\n1. They use paper ties to create comfort/complacency\n2. They've shown willingness to break patterns with rock\n3. They might expect us to be wary of another paper sequence\n4. They could be setting up another trap\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock. Here's why:\n1. They may expect us to play scissors to break the paper tie\n2. Or expect us to stick with paper fearing their rock\n3. Rock becomes strong because:\n   - Beats scissors if they expect us to break tie pattern\n   - Ties against their potential rock\n   - Shows we've learned from their trap strategy\n4.
