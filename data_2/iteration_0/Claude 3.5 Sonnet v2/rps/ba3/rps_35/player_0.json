    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Initial Analysis:\n   - I'm facing a new player with no prior history\n   - Need to consider the point system:\n     * Paper beating rock gives highest points (3)\n     * Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give less points (1)\n\n2. Strategy Consideration:\n   - Since it's the first move, opponent has no pattern to analyze\n   - Paper has potential for highest reward (3 points)\n   - Paper also has moderate risk (-1 if opponent plays scissors)\n\n3. Risk vs Reward:\n   - Paper: potential +3/-1 points\n   - Rock: potential +1/-3 points\n   - Scissors: potential +1/-1 points\n\n4. Decision Making:\n   - Paper offers best reward-to-risk ratio\n   - As first move, opponents often choose rock\n   - Even if we lose with paper, penalty is minimal (-1)\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it offers the highest potential gain while maintaining reasonable risk.\n\n[move] paper Because it offers the highest potential points while keeping risks moderate.\n"

Pattern Analysis:\n   - After losing to scissors, opponent consistently plays rock\n   - This has been a reliable pattern throughout game\n   - They use rock both as:\n     * Counter to scissors\n     * Safe defensive move when uncertain\n   - Pattern has remained consistent despite their losses\n\n3. Psychological Evaluation:\n   - Opponent has lost 20 times\n   - Never achieved a single win\n   - Shows remarkable consistency in reactive patterns\n   - Might finally break pattern out of pure desperation\n   - But has not shown ability to adapt strategy\n\n4. Strategic Considerations:\n   - Most likely response: rock to counter scissors\n   - They've shown this response repeatedly\n   - Paper would beat their expected rock play\n   - Higher reward potential (+3)\n   - Risk is justified given prediction accuracy\n\n5. Decision Making:\n   - Highest probability: opponent plays rock\n   - Paper gives best reward against expected rock\n   - Their patterns have held even under extreme losses\n   - Need to maintain psychological advantage\n   - Aggressive play appropriate given prediction confidence\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, expecting opponent to play rock as a counter to my winning scissors move.\n\n[move] paper Anticipating opponent will use rock to counter scissors loss\n"

Complete Game Status:\n   - 23 rounds played:\n     * 21 wins (no losses)\n     * 2 ties\n     * Last sequence: rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper (all wins)\n     * Just won with paper against rock (+3)\n   - Perfect prediction streak continues\n\n2. Pattern Recognition:\n   - After losing to paper (especially -3), opponent very consistently plays scissors\n   - This has been one of the most reliable patterns\n   - They've shown this reactive behavior throughout:\n     * After big losses (-3)\n     * When trying to counter paper\n     * When most frustrated\n\n3. Psychological Factors:\n   - Opponent has lost 21 times\n   - Just suffered another major loss (-3)\n   - Has never won a single round\n   - Still maintains predictable responses\n   - Might finally snap out of pattern (but hasn't yet)\n\n4. Strategic Analysis:\n   - Highest probability: opponent plays scissors\n   - They consistently try to counter paper after -3 loss\n   - Rock would beat their expected scissors\n   - Rock also safe against desperate rock play\n   - Conservative approach after high-scoring round\n\n5. Decision Making:\n   - Most likely: opponent plays scissors\n   - Rock perfectly counters expected scissors\n   - Need to maintain winning momentum\n   - Lower risk appropriate after high-scoring round\n   - Pattern has held even under extreme frustration\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, expecting opponent to play scissors to counter my successful paper play.\n\n[move] rock Anticipating opponent will use scissors to counter previous paper loss\n"
