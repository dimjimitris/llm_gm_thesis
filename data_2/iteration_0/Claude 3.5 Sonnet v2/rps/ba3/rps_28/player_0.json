    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) with a moderate potential loss (-1). Rock has a smaller gain potential (+1) but larger loss risk (-3). Scissors has balanced risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no pattern data to analyze. However, rock is often a common first move for many players as it's seen as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this analysis, I suggest playing paper. It counters the common rock opening and offers the highest potential gain. Even if we lose, the penalty is relatively small.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Paper offers the best risk-reward ratio in this opening situation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move against a fresh player, paper provides the optimal balance of high potential gain (+3) and manageable risk (-1).\n"

Or it could have been random\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this information, we have several options:\n1. Play rock - This would counter their previous scissors move if they repeat it (+1 points)\n2. Play paper - Risky if they repeat scissors (-1 points)\n3. Play scissors - Safe if they repeat scissors (0 points)\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent might be using a strategy where they aim to counter what they think we'll play next. After we played paper, they might expect us to switch to rock (to counter their scissors), in which case they might play paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: We need to think one level deeper. If they expect us to play rock (to counter their previous scissors), and they plan to counter that with paper, then we should play scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. This creates a balanced situation where:\n- If they play paper (expecting our rock), we win (+1)\n- If they repeat scissors, we tie (0)\n- If they play rock, we lose but with minimal penalty (-1)\n\nGame Theorist: The scissors play offers a good risk-reward ratio here and accounts for the most likely opponent strategies.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Based on opponent's previous move and potential strategic adaptations, scissors provides a balanced option that could counter an anticipated paper play while minimizing potential losses.\n"

In rock-paper-scissors, after a tie, players often:\n1. Stick with the same move, hoping their opponent will change\n2. Switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move\n3. Switch to the move that would have lost to their previous move\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's analyze each possibility:\n1. If they stick with scissors \u2192 we should play rock (+1)\n2. If they switch to rock (beats scissors) \u2192 we should play paper (+3)\n3. If they switch to paper (loses to scissors) \u2192 we should play scissors (+1)\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, playing rock here is particularly attractive:\n- If they play scissors again (possibility 1): we win +1\n- If they play rock (possibility 2): we tie 0\n- If they play paper (possibility 3): we lose -3\nThe expected value is decent given their shown preference for scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given their aggressive style so far (two scissors plays), they might be less likely to choose the defensive paper option. This makes rock even more attractive.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Rock provides a good counter to their demonstrated scissors preference while having a neutral outcome against another likely choice (rock).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on opponent's historical preference for scissors and common post-tie behaviors, rock offers strong potential for positive points while maintaining reasonable risk management.\n"

They've effectively countered each of our moves, suggesting they might be predicting our logic. Our total score is -4 points.\n\nStrategic Planner: We need to reassess our strategy. The opponent has shown:\n1. Adaptability - they're not stuck in patterns\n2. Aggressive wins - they go for paper (high risk/reward) when they predict rock\n3. Avoidance of rock - possibly because it has the worst negative payoff (-3)\n\nGame Theorist: Given their avoidance of rock, scissors becomes an attractive option:\n- If they play paper (continuing their last success): we win +1\n- If they play scissors (returning to their comfort move): we tie 0\n- If they finally play rock: we lose -1 (but this seems less likely given their history)\n\nPattern Analyst: There's also a psychological element. After scoring a big win (+3), players often:\n1. Try to repeat their success (paper again)\n2. Get overconfident and aggressive (scissors)\nBoth these scenarios make scissors a good choice.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with scissors.

In such situations, when an opponent has demonstrated superior prediction abilities, game theory suggests we should move to pure randomization to become unpredictable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their moves:\nscissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\nThey've shown a preference for scissors (3 times) but can adapt when needed.\n\nGame Theorist: I suggest we use the concept of \"maximum minimization\" here - choosing the move that minimizes our worst possible loss.

However, they've demonstrated they learn and adapt, so they're unlikely to follow the exact same pattern.\n\nPattern Analyst: Interesting observations:\n1. They've used scissors most frequently (4 times)\n2. We've had two scissors-ties now\n3. After the first scissors-tie, they countered our rock with paper\n4. They seem to avoid being predictable after ties\n\nGame Theorist: In rock-paper-scissors, there's a concept called \"rotation\" - players often rotate one step forward (rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock) or backward after a tie. Since we both played scissors, they might rotate to rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we believe they'll rotate to rock, paper would be our best play:\n- If they play rock (rotation): we win big (+3)\n- If they play paper (anti-rotation): we tie (0)\n- If they play scissors (repeat): we lose small (-1)\n\nPattern Analyst: Given their demonstrated sophistication, they might expect us to think this deeply and try to counter our paper with scissors.

They've never repeated the tied move\n2. They've tended to shift to moves that would have beaten the tie move\n3. They seem to avoid predictable patterns\n\nPattern Analyst: Important observations:\n1. They've used all moves fairly evenly now (rock: 3, paper: 2, scissors: 4)\n2. After their recent -3 loss, they've played more conservatively (rock)\n3. They haven't used paper since R3\n\nGame Theorist: Given their sophisticated play style and our previous success with paper, they might expect us to play paper to counter their expected rock-to-scissors rotation.

Play paper to aim for high points (+3)\n3. Play scissors in hopes of a tie\n\nPattern Analyst: Recent patterns:\n1. They finally used paper after a long drought and lost\n2.

Their comfort move (scissors) hasn't appeared in the last three rounds\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated strategic depth, they might expect us to think they'll play rock to counter our potential scissors repeat. This would lead them to play paper to counter our expected rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: However, they've also shown a tendency to return to scissors when under pressure, and they haven't used it in a while.

However, they've shown they learn from patterns and avoid being predictable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Critical observations:\n1. They've had two consecutive non-scoring rounds (paper loss, rock tie)\n2. Their move distribution: rock(5), paper(3), scissors(3)\n3. We haven't seen scissors from them in 5 rounds\n\nGame Theorist: After two consecutive rock ties, players often:\n1. Feel stuck in a pattern and make a dramatic change\n2. Try to capitalize on opponent's expected adjustment\n3. Switch to their preferred move when uncertain\n\nPattern Analyst: The long absence of scissors is significant. In previous long absences from scissors, they eventually returned to it, especially when needing to break a non-scoring streak.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they follow their historical pattern of returning to scissors after a drought, rock would be optimal. However, they've shown they can identify and break patterns we might spot.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their sophisticated play and our current sequence, they might expect us to:\n1.

This would lead them to play rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: However, this opponent has shown they're capable of multi-level thinking. If they think we've figured out they'll play rock to counter our expected scissors, they might stick with paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: Key factors:\n1. They've just scored their first points in several rounds\n2. They've shown mastery of using paper strategically\n3.

They might expect us to play rock (common post-scissors-tie move)\n2. They might think we'll expect paper (based on their R2 pattern)\n3. They might anticipate we'll stick with scissors to force another tie\n\nPattern Analyst: Critical observations:\n1. They've just returned to scissors after a long absence\n2. Their last three moves: paper\u2192scissors (showing adaptability)\n3. After their previous scissors-ties, they never repeated scissors\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated ability to play multiple levels deep, they might expect us to play rock (the common counter to scissors-ties). This would lead them to play paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: However, they've also shown they can be unpredictable when we think we've figured out their pattern. The fact that they returned to scissors might indicate a willingness to use it more.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their behavior after high-scoring rounds (like their recent -3 win), they tend to play more conservatively.
