    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My paper strategy has consistently performed better against their scissors than rock has\n2. They've shown remarkable commitment to scissors even after losses\n3. Their history shows they tend to stick with scissors even when it's predictable\n4. After losing with scissors, they might:\n   - Still stick with scissors (their most common pattern)\n   - Try rock to beat my paper\n   - Switch to paper expecting me to change\n5. Given their strong scissors preference and past behavior, they're more likely to stick with scissors than adapt\n\nThis continues the psychological strategy of betting on their established behavioral pattern rather than assuming they'll make the optimal counter-move.\n"
