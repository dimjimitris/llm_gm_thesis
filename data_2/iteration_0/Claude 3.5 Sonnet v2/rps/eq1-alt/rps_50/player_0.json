    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without any prior information, all moves are equally viable:\n   - Rock is a solid opening move as it's often chosen by players\n   - Paper could counter if opponent also thinks rock is a good opener\n   - Scissors might catch someone trying to be clever with paper\n\n4. Key consideration: Paper has psychological appeal as an opening move because:\n   - It feels less aggressive than rock\n   - Many players avoid scissors as first move due to its perceived aggression\n   - Paper can beat the common rock opening\n\n5. Decision making:\n   Based on psychological factors and equal mathematical probability, I'll choose paper as my opening move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analysis of rock frequency:\n   - Rock is becoming overused in our recent exchanges\n   - Three ties with rock suggests both players are being too cautious\n   - There's likely psychological pressure to break this pattern\n   - Most players avoid playing the same move that led to multiple ties\n\n4.

Post-tie psychology:\n   - Rock ties often lead to players seeking advantage\n   - Both players know rock is the \"safe\" move\n   - They've demonstrated they can:\n     * Maintain long streaks\n     * Break patterns unexpectedly\n     * Read and counter my moves\n\n4. Strategic options analysis:\n   - Rock again: Too conservative after tie\n   - Scissors: Risky against likely rock or paper\n   - Paper: Beats rock if they stay, loses to likely scissors\n   - They might expect me to play conservatively\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given their demonstrated ability to read patterns\n   - And their shift away from streak-based play\n   - And the psychological pressure after a tie\n   - I'll choose paper because:\n     * Most players stick with rock after a tie\n     * Their pattern suggests they value stability\n     * They might expect me to play scissors thinking they'll play paper\n     * Paper beats their potential rock while accepting scissors risk\n     * Need to take calculated risks to break tie cycle\n\n[move] paper\n"
