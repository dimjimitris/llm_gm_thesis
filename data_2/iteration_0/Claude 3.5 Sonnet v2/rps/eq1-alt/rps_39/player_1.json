    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

AI Assistant (me) - For coordinating and making final decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, when playing against a fresh opponent with no prior history, the Nash equilibrium for Rock-Paper-Scissors suggests using a random strategy with equal probability (1/3) for each move. This prevents being exploited by any specific counter-strategy.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no pattern data to analyze yet. However, studies show that in RPS, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nRisk Manager: Given this information, we might want to counter the common \"Rock-first\" tendency by playing Paper. However, if the opponent is sophisticated, they might anticipate this and play Scissors. The safest approach is to follow the game theory optimal strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with following game theory here. Any deterministic strategy can be exploited if discovered. Let's make a random choice among the three options.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Thank you all for the input. Given this is our first move with no prior information, I agree that following game theory principles is our best strategy.

They might be following a similar game theory approach\n2. They might stick with paper since it resulted in a tie\n3. They might switch to scissors expecting us to play paper again\n\nGame Strategist: In a repeated game scenario after a tie, players often tend to either:\n- Stick with their previous move thinking the opponent will change\n- Change their move thinking the opponent will stick\nHowever, we should be careful not to over-interpret a single data point.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that both players showed similar thinking in round 1 (both choosing paper), we should consider that our opponent might be using similar strategic reasoning. If they're thinking at this level, they might expect us to switch to rock to beat their potential scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we maintain unpredictability while slightly adjusting for the observed behavior. Since they matched our paper play, they might be using similar strategic thinking, making this a sophisticated opponent.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Considering all inputs, I agree we shouldn't over-interpret one round but should maintain unpredictability while accounting for the likelihood of our opponent's strategic thinking. I'll choose scissors to counter a potential repeat paper play while also being a reasonable choice against an opponent who might switch to rock.\n\n[move] scissors While maintaining unpredictability, this move accounts for potential opponent patterns after our tied paper-paper round.\n"

There might be a pattern forming, but more importantly, they just lost with Rock.\n\nGame Strategist: In game psychology, players who just lost often:\n1. Switch strategies completely\n2. Return to a previously successful move (in this case, Paper)\n3. Stick to their losing move out of stubbornness\nGiven we just won with Scissors, they might expect us to stick with our winning move.\n\nRisk Manager: We need to consider that losing a round might make our opponent more unpredictable or aggressive in their strategy. They might be expecting us to get overconfident after our win and try to predict our move.\n\nGame Strategist: True. After losing, many players default to \"what beat me last time\" to counter their opponent's previous success. Since we won with Scissors, they might play Paper to beat our potential Rock.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given this analysis, I think our opponent is likely to either:\n1. Play Paper (to beat our potential Rock, or return to their first successful move)\n2. Play Scissors (to beat our potential Paper if they think we're trying to be too clever)\n\nRock would be a strong choice here as it:\n- Beats Scissors if they try to counter our potential Paper\n- Ties with Rock if they're stubborn\n- Only loses to Paper, which while possible, is less likely given the psychological factors at play\n\n[move] rock This move accounts for the opponent's likely psychological state after losing and common counter-strategies.\n"

The opponent seems to be gravitating toward Rock as a \"safe\" move after their loss. They might be playing more conservatively now after their earlier loss. In RPS psychology, Rock is often seen as the most \"stable\" or \"defensive\" choice.\n\nRisk Manager: We need to consider that:\n1. They might stick with Rock for a third time, feeling it's \"safer\" than losing\n2. They might finally break away from Rock, expecting us to play Paper\n3. They might be using these Rock moves to establish a pattern before breaking it\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent seems to be playing rather conventionally so far - started with Paper, then moved to Rock and stuck with it. This suggests they might not be using highly sophisticated strategies.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their apparent conservative play style and preference for Rock, I believe they're likely to either:\n1. Stick with Rock again (showing risk aversion)\n2. Finally switch to Paper (to break their pattern and counter our potential Paper)\nScissors would be their riskiest choice here.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Considering all inputs, I believe this is the perfect moment for Paper.

The opponent has now:\n- Lost twice\n- Tried all three moves\n- Just lost after making a more aggressive move (Scissors)\nPlayers who lose after taking risks often revert to more conservative plays.\n\nRisk Manager: This is a psychologically challenging position for our opponent:\n1. They've lost twice now, which might make them frustrated\n2. Their attempt to be unpredictable with Scissors backfired\n3. They might be questioning their entire strategy\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their sequence hasn't shown any clear repeating pattern, but their moves seem to be reactive rather than strategic - they appear to be responding to previous rounds rather than planning ahead.\n\nGame Strategist: After losing with an aggressive move (Scissors), players often:\n1. Return to their \"comfort move\" (in their case, possibly Rock)\n2. Try to double-down on aggression out of frustration\n3. Try to completely outsmart their opponent by doing the unexpected\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given this analysis, I believe Rock is our best play here because:\n- It beats Scissors if they double-down on aggression\n- It ties with Rock if they return to their comfort move\n- While it loses to Paper, they seem less likely to choose Paper given their recent losses and apparent reactive playing style\n\n[move] rock This move protects against likely aggressive responses while maintaining a strong position against their probable comfort move.\n"

They use Rock as their \"safe harbor\" move (3 times now)\n2. Their attempts to deviate (Scissors) have been unsuccessful\n3. They might be stuck in a defensive mindset after losing twice\n\nRisk Manager: Key considerations:\n1. Three Rock plays from them suggests a strong psychological anchor to this move\n2. They've lost both rounds where they or we deviated from matching moves\n3. The pattern of ties might make them reluctant to change\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their return to Rock after the failed Scissors attempt strongly suggests risk-averse behavior. This is further reinforced by the fact that they've achieved ties with Rock but losses with other moves.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a prime opportunity to exploit their apparent comfort with Rock. While they might expect us to play Paper here, their demonstrated risk aversion suggests they're more likely to stick with their \"safe\" move than try to counter our expected counter.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given this analysis, I believe Paper is our strongest play because:\n1.
