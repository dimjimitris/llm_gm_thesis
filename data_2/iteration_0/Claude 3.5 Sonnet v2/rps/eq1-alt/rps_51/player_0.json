    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the possible moves and outcomes:\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper\n   - Paper beats rock\n   Each win gives +1 point, each loss -1 point\n\n3. Since there's no historical data, all moves are equally viable. Each move:\n   - Has 1/3 chance of winning (+1 point)\n   - Has 1/3 chance of losing (-1 point)\n   - Has 1/3 chance of tying (0 points)\n\n4. In this case of complete uncertainty, any choice is strategically equivalent.\n\n5. However, from psychology studies, rock is often a popular first move choice for many players since it represents strength.\n\n6. Therefore, I'll choose paper to counter this potential tendency.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - Their moves: scissors \u2192 rock\n   - Shows they're adaptable and may be reading my moves\n   - The tie might make them want to break the stalemate\n\n3.

Strategic considerations:\n   - If they expect rock again, they might play paper\n   - If they try to be aggressive, they might play scissors\n   - Paper would be risky against potential scissors\n   - Rock would lose against likely paper\n   - Scissors would win against paper and tie against scissors\n\n5.
