    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs of different moves\n3. Pattern Analyzer - For identifying patterns and making predictions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Rock vs Paper gives the highest points (3), while Paper vs Scissors and Scissors vs Rock only give 1 point. However, losing with Paper against Rock also has the highest penalty (-3).\n\nRisk Analyst: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we should consider a balanced approach. The high-risk, high-reward option is Paper, but it could result in a significant penalty if they play Rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Without any previous moves to analyze, we can't predict the opponent's behavior. However, in many games, players often start with Rock as their first move, as it's considered a \"strong\" opening.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest playing Paper. While it carries the risk of a -3 penalty, it has two advantages:\n1. If the opponent plays Rock (a common first move), we get the maximum possible points (3)\n2. If they play Paper, we tie with no penalty\nOnly Scissors would beat us, but that would only cost us 1 point.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. The potential reward (3 points) outweighs the risk, especially since Paper gives us a safe tie scenario and minimizes loss against Scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper - Opening with Paper to capitalize on potential Rock play while maintaining reasonable risk level.\n"

They have a similar strategic thinking process to us\n2. They might change their move now to try to counter Paper\n3. Or they might stick with Paper hoping we'll change our move\n\nGame Strategist: In a tie situation, players often tend to switch their moves in the next round, expecting their opponent to repeat their previous move. However, this creates an interesting mind game - do we expect them to switch, and therefore switch ourselves, or do we expect them to expect us to switch?\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze each possibility:\n- If we stay with Paper: Win vs Rock (3), Tie vs Paper (0), Lose vs Scissors (-1)\n- If we play Rock: Win vs Scissors (1), Lose vs Paper (-3), Tie vs Rock (0)\n- If we play Scissors: Win vs Paper (1), Lose vs Rock (-1), Tie vs Scissors (0)\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they matched our Paper strategy last time, they might be a strategic player. Strategic players often avoid the high-risk Rock option in early games. Between Paper and Scissors, Scissors is the logical counter to Paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. Playing Scissors here has a balanced risk profile:\n- Best case: We win 1 point if they stick with Paper\n- Worst case: We lose 1 point if they play Rock\n- Neutral case: We tie if they also switch to Scissors\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological tendency to switch after a tie also supports playing Scissors here.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors - Expecting opponent might stick with Paper or anticipating their most likely switch from Paper.\n"

Second round: Both Scissors\nThis suggests either:\n1. They're using similar strategic thinking\n2. They might be deliberately mimicking our moves\n3. Or this could be pure coincidence\n\nGame Strategist: This mirroring behavior is crucial information. If they are indeed thinking along similar lines, we need to try to think one step ahead. After two ties, there's often a strong psychological urge to \"break the pattern.\"\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at our current position:\n- The game is still at 0-0\n- No player has taken any risks yet\n- Both players have shown cautious, strategic play\n\nGame Strategist: Given that both players moved from Paper to Scissors, the conventional next move in this cycle would be Rock. However, if they're thinking the same way, we might end up in another tie. We could try to break the pattern.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The sequence so far has been Paper \u2192 Scissors. The natural completion of this cycle would be Rock. However, if our opponent is indeed mirroring us or thinking similarly, they might also arrive at this same conclusion.\n\nRisk Analyst: Since we've had two ties, taking a calculated risk might be worthwhile. If we assume they'll play Rock (completing the cycle), Paper would give us the maximum 3 points. However, if they anticipate this and play Scissors, we'd only lose 1 point.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing Paper here. It's an aggressive but calculated move because:\n1. If they complete the cycle with Rock, we get 3 points\n2. If they mirror us again, it's another tie\n3. If they out-think us and play Scissors, we only lose 1 point\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper - Breaking the expected cycle with a high-reward potential move while maintaining acceptable risk.\n"

Paper (tie)\nThis can't be coincidence anymore. Our opponent appears to be either:\n1. Using the exact same strategic reasoning as us\n2. Deliberately mirroring our moves\n3. Or possibly they are analyzing and predicting our moves perfectly\n\nGame Strategist: This is a fascinating psychological situation. The obvious tension here is that both players are trying to outsmart each other but ending up in perfect synchronization. We need to consider whether to:\n1. Make a completely unexpected move\n2. Try to exploit the mirroring if it continues\n3. Use reverse psychology\n\nRisk Analyst: At this point, with three ties, neither player has scored any points. This suggests our opponent is also very cautious and strategic. Let's analyze our options:\n\nIf they continue mirroring:\n- Any move will result in a tie\nIf they try to break the pattern:\n- They might expect us to play Scissors (following Paper)\n- They might try to counter our expected Scissors with Rock\n\nPattern Analyzer: The sequence has been Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper. If they expect us to follow the previous sub-pattern, they'll expect Scissors again. If they're trying to win, they might play Rock to beat our expected Scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest we play Paper again. Here's why:\n1. If they're still mirroring, we get another tie (safe)\n2. If they try to counter our \"expected\" Scissors with Rock, we win big (3 points)\n3. If they try to be clever and play Scissors, we only lose 1 point\n\nRisk Analyst: This is an excellent strategic choice.

The opponent has shown they're capable of:\n1. Patient play (waiting through three ties)\n2. Pattern recognition\n3. Decisive action when they strike\n\nRisk Analyst: We're now at -3 points, which puts us in a challenging position. We need to be more conservative now that we're behind.

Play defensively with Rock (to avoid another -3)\n2. Try to get immediate revenge with Paper against their expected Rock\n3. Play Scissors as a safe middle ground\n\nPattern Analyzer: After a successful aggressive move, players often:\n- Either continue their aggressive strategy (stick with Rock)\n- Or switch to a defensive move expecting retaliation\n\nRisk Analyst: Given our -3 position, I recommend Scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with Rock (continuing aggression), we lose only 1 more point\n2. If they expect us to play Paper (revenge) and play Scissors, we tie\n3. If they play Paper (being defensive), we win 1 point\nThis provides the best risk-reward balance in our current position.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree.

Scissors (tie)\nThe opponent has shown they can both mirror and deviate strategically. After their successful Rock play, they returned to mirroring with Scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a complex psychological situation. After their successful deviation and our defensive Scissors play, they matched us again. This could mean:\n1. They're back to their mirroring strategy\n2. They're setting up another trap\n3. They're trying to lull us into a false sense of security\n\nRisk Analyst: Our current position (-3 points) still requires careful play. Let's analyze likely scenarios:\n- If they're truly back to mirroring: any move results in a tie\n- If they're setting up another trap: they might expect us to be more aggressive trying to make up points\n- If they're playing mind games: they might expect us to be overly cautious now\n\nPattern Analyzer: After Scissors, the historical pattern suggests Paper might come next. However, given our previous experience, that's risky. The opponent has shown they can read and punish predictable patterns.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest playing Rock here. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they continue mirroring: we get a tie (safe)\n2. If they expect us to play Paper to recover points: we lose only 1 point to their Scissors\n3.

We need to consider:\n1. Defense: Avoid further losses\n2. Recovery: Look for opportunities to score points\n3. Psychology: The opponent has shown superior prediction skills\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent's last two attacking moves were:\n- Rock when we played Paper\n- Scissors when we played Rock\nThis suggests they're good at reading our strategic shifts between aggressive and defensive plays.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated ability to predict and counter our moves, we need to be less predictable. After losing to Scissors, many players would play Paper to counter expected Rock, or Scissors to play it safe.

They might try to immediately regain dominance with an aggressive play\n3. They might expect us to get overconfident after our win\n\nPattern Analyzer: After a player's first loss, there's often a strong tendency to:\n- Play more conservatively\n- Try to \"reset\" the psychological dynamic\n- Return to previously successful strategies\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they just lost to Scissors, they're likely to avoid Paper. Most players would either play:\n- Rock (to beat our potentially repeated Scissors)\n- Scissors (to play it safe with a potential tie)\nPaper would be their riskiest choice.\n\nRisk Analyst: I recommend Paper here. Here's why:\n1. If they play Rock (most aggressive counter to our Scissors): we lose 3 points\n2. If they play Scissors (safe play): we lose 1 point\n3. If they play Paper (unlikely): we tie\n4. But if they overthink and play Scissors (expecting us to play Rock): we win 3 points\n\nPattern Analyzer: While Paper is risky, it's also psychologically sound. After just losing to Scissors, the opponent is least likely to play Paper again, making Rock or Scissors their probable moves. Paper has the potential to catch them if they play Rock to counter our previous successful Scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree.

Rock (lost to Scissors, -1)\nCurrent total: -7 points\nWe're in a very difficult position.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has demonstrated exceptional skill:\n1. Perfect timing with their attacks\n2. Ability to read and counter our strategy shifts\n3. Disciplined play (never making costly mistakes)\n4. Only one round where they lost points\n\nRisk Analyst: At -7 points, we're in an extremely vulnerable position:\n- We've lost 5 rounds\n- Won only 1 round\n- Had 3 ties\n- Our Paper plays have been especially costly (-3 points each)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at recent moves:\n- When we play Paper, they counter with Rock\n- When we play Rock, they counter with Scissors\n- When we play Scissors, they've varied their responses\nThis suggests they have excellent read on our decision-making process.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the opponent's demonstrated ability to counter our strategic plays, we need to become completely unpredictable. They've shown they can:\n1. Punish our calculated risks\n2. Anticipate our defensive moves\n3. Counter our balanced approaches\n\nRisk Analyst: At this point, Paper is too risky (-3 potential loss). Between Rock and Scissors:\n- Scissors: Wins vs Paper (+1), Loses vs Rock (-1), Ties vs Scissors\n- Rock: Wins vs Scissors (+1), Loses vs Paper (-3), Ties vs Rock\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent might expect us to:\n1. Avoid Paper due to previous heavy losses\n2. Stick to Scissors as our most successful move\n3. Try Rock again thinking they won't repeat Scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Given all this, I recommend Scissors. Here's why:\n1. It's been our only successful move so far\n2. The opponent might expect us to avoid it after just losing with Rock\n3. Maximum potential loss is only -1\n4. It breaks the pattern of us switching moves after losses\n5. The opponent might play Paper thinking we'll choose Rock defensively\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. At -7 points, we can't risk another -3 from Paper, and Rock just failed us.

We've won with Scissors twice now, but look at the pattern:\n- The opponent rarely repeats moves after a loss\n- They've shown they can read our strategic shifts\n- They might expect us to stick with Scissors after a win\n\nRisk Analyst: While we're still at -6 points, the momentum has shifted slightly:\n- We've won 2 of the last 4 rounds\n- Our last Scissors play was successful\n- Small wins are better than big losses at this point\n\nPattern Analyzer: After losing to Scissors, opponents typically:\n1. Avoid Paper (which loses to Scissors)\n2. Often switch to Rock (to beat expected repeated Scissors)\n3. Sometimes play Scissors (expecting opponent to switch away)\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has consistently shown they can:\n- Read our logical progressions\n- Punish predictable plays\n- Time their counters well\nThey'll likely expect us to either:\n- Stay with Scissors after success\n- Switch to Paper to beat their expected Rock\n- Play Rock defensively\n\nRisk Analyst: Given this analysis, I recommend Paper. Here's why:\n1. If they expect us to repeat Scissors and play Rock: we win 3 points\n2. If they play Scissors expecting us to switch to Rock: we lose only 1 point\n3. If they play Paper: we tie\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological dynamic favors Paper here:\n- After losing to Scissors, they're likely to play Rock\n- They might expect us to get predictable after success\n- Paper is our riskiest move, which makes it unexpectedly unpredictable at this point\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with Paper. While it's our riskiest move, the opponent has shown such good reading of our \"safe\" plays that we need to take a calculated risk.

Avoid being predictable\n2. Counter our expected moves\n3. Adapt to our strategy changes\n\nGiven this, they might expect us to:\n- Play Rock to complete the cycle\n- Stick with Paper after a loss\n- Return to Scissors as our most successful move\n\nRisk Analyst: At this point, I recommend Rock.

Paper (won vs Scissors, +1)\n18. Rock (won vs Paper, +3)\nCurrent total: +7 points\nSEVEN consecutive scoring rounds! We've completely dominated the late game!\n\nGame Strategist: We're in an extraordinary position:\n- Seven straight scoring rounds\n- No losses in recent history\n- Perfect reads on opponent\n- Massive +7 point lead\n\nRisk Analyst: With +7 points:\n- We can play ultra-conservatively\n- Victory is nearly secured\n- Avoid any unnecessary risks\n- Even multiple small losses would be acceptable\n\nPattern Analyzer: Our recent sequence has been beautiful:\nScissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock (all wins)\nWe've shown:\n- Complete cycle of moves\n- Each move winning\n- Perfect timing\n- Superior strategic reading\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent is likely:\n1. Completely demoralized after many losses\n2. Might make desperate unpredictable moves\n3. Could also resign to defensive play\n4. Struggling to read our strategy\n\nRisk Analyst: I recommend Scissors here. Here's why:\n1. If they play Paper (defensive/desperate): we win +1\n2. If they play Rock (trying to be aggressive): we lose only -1\n3. If they play Scissors (playing safe): we tie\nEven a loss keeps us at +6, well ahead\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological dynamics favor Scissors:\n- After losing to Rock, Paper is a common desperation play\n- They might expect us to stay with Rock after success\n- They're likely trying to break their losing streak\n- Their decision-making seems compromised\n\nGame Strategist: I strongly agree with Scissors. It's perfect because:\n1. Breaks our own pattern while staying unpredictable\n2. Minimal risk (-1 at worst)\n3. Counters likely desperate Paper play\n4. Maintains pressure while protecting our lead\n5. Could extend our winning streak further\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors - Playing a safe move that maintains pressure while protecting our substantial lead, looking to capitalize on opponent's likely desperation\n"
