Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. In a standard rock-paper-scissors game, each move would have equal expected value with random play. However, the asymmetric scoring system changes the incentives.\n\n4. The highest reward comes from playing rock against paper (3 points), but it also carries the highest risk (losing 3 points).\n\n5. Paper and scissors both offer lower risk and reward profiles (\u00b11 point).\n\n6. Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent, I should avoid the highest risk option.\n\n7. Between paper and scissors, there's no clear mathematical advantage in this single round.\n\n8. However, many new players tend to choose rock in their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n\n9.

Their most recent three-move sequence appears to be orderly (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), which suggests scissors next if this pattern continues.\n\n18.

Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n    - Round 8: Rock\n    - Round 9: Paper\n    - Round 10: Scissors\n\n12. This confirms they've been playing a sequential pattern of rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors in order.\n\n13. If they continue this pattern, their next move would be rock.\n\n14. If they play rock, my best response would be paper to win 1 point.\n\n15. However, I need to consider if they might disrupt this pattern now that it has become obvious:\n    a) They might anticipate I've noticed their sequence\n    b) They might skip to paper expecting me to play paper against their expected rock\n    c) If they play paper and I play paper, it would be a tie\n\n16. Looking at the overall game history, they've shown an ability to adapt and develop patterns.\n\n17. The sequential pattern of rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors has been consistent for several rounds now, which makes it likely they'll continue with rock next.\n\n18. However, there's also a significant chance they might try to be unpredictable now that their pattern is established.\n\n19. Weighing these factors, I believe paper is still the most reasonable play - it follows the logical response to their pattern while not exposing me to the highest potential loss.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n    - Round 9: Paper\n    - Round 10: Scissors\n    - Round 11: Rock\n\n13. Their rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors pattern seemed to break down, as they played rock after scissors, rather than returning to rock.\n\n14. Looking at the overall game:\n    - They played rock in rounds 1, 2, 3, 8, 11 (5 times)\n    - They played paper in rounds 4, 6, 9 (3 times)\n    - They played scissors in rounds 5, 7, 10 (3 times)\n\n15. They show a clear preference for rock throughout the game.\n\n16. The most recent sequence (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock) doesn't clearly indicate what might come next.\n\n17. If they're returning to their rock preference, they might play rock again.\n\n18. If they're trying to maximize points, they might notice that rock has worked well against me (winning them 3 points twice).\n\n19. Given their tendency to play rock and its success against me, they might continue with rock.\n\n20. If they play rock, my best response would be paper.\n\n21. However, given that I just lost significantly with paper against rock (which doesn't make logical sense based on the rules), I need to reconsider the game dynamics.\n\n22. Wait, I need to correct my understanding. In this variant:\n    - Paper beats scissors (not rock) giving the winner 1 point\n    - Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points\n    - Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point\n\n23. With this corrected understanding, rock is indeed strong against paper, and scissors is strong against rock.\n\n24. If they play rock again, my best response would be scissors to win 1 point.\n\n25. Given their preference for rock and its recent success, scissors seems to be the most strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They seem to have returned to the rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors sequence.\n\n15. If they continue this pattern, their next move would be scissors.\n\n16. If they play scissors, my best response would be rock to win 3 points.\n\n17. However, I've been consistently misreading their patterns, which suggests they might be deliberately misleading or adapting to counter my strategies.\n\n18. Looking at our scoring so far:\n    - I've only won twice (Rounds 3 and 8), both times with scissors against rock\n    - I've lost several times with various moves\n    - We've tied a few times\n\n19. My opponent seems to be consistently outplaying me, suggesting they may be tracking my moves and adapting accordingly.\n\n20. Given their apparent strategic advantage, I should try a different approach rather than simply reacting to perceived patterns.\n\n21. Since rock offers the highest potential reward (3 points) when it wins against scissors, and their sequence suggests scissors next, rock seems to be the most advantageous play.\n\n22. Additionally, I haven't played rock recently, which might make it less predictable.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost 1 point.\n13. Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point.\n\n14. Wait - there's something confusing in the results. In Round 13, I played rock and opponent played scissors. According to the rules:\n    - Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n\n15. But I'm told I lost 1 point, which aligns with the rules. I misunderstood the outcome. Let me correctly analyze the game dynamics:\n    - Paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n    - Rock beats paper (winner +3, loser -3)\n    - Scissors beats rock (winner +1, loser -1)\n\n16. Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n    - Round 11: Rock\n    - Round 12: Paper\n    - Round 13: Scissors\n\n17. They have been following a clear rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors sequence for several rounds.\n\n18. If they continue this pattern, their next move would be rock.\n\n19. If they play rock, my best response would be scissors, which beats rock (+1 point).\n\n20. However, this pattern has become extremely predictable, which makes me wonder if they'll break it.\n\n21. If they anticipate I've noticed their pattern and expect me to play scissors against their expected rock, they might play paper instead to beat my scissors.\n\n22. Given that they've maintained this pattern for multiple rounds despite its predictability, it seems more likely they'll continue it rather than break it now.\n\n23. The strategic choice would be to play scissors, anticipating their rock, while accepting the risk that they might break the pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

I played rock, they played paper, and I'm told I won 3 points. According to the rules:\n   - Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n\n17. But rock doesn't beat paper in this variant - paper should beat rock. Let me double-check the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n   - Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n   - Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n\n18. Ok, I made an error in my understanding. Rock does beat paper in this variant, not the other way around. This explains why I won 3 points.\n\n19.

Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n    - Round 16: Scissors\n    - Round 17: Rock\n    - Round 18: Paper\n\n20. They're still following their scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper sequence.\n\n21. If they maintain this pattern, their next move would be scissors.\n\n22. If they play scissors, my best response would be paper to win 1 point.\n\n23. I've now successfully predicted their pattern for five consecutive rounds, winning each time with increasing confidence.\n\n24. The pattern has been extremely consistent throughout many rounds, and despite multiple losses, they haven't changed their strategy.\n\n25. While there's always a possibility they might finally adapt their strategy, the overwhelming evidence suggests they'll continue their predictable sequence.\n\n26. The optimal move is to continue exploiting their pattern by playing paper against their expected scissors move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

For the first time, they've broken their long-established pattern. Instead of playing scissors after paper, they played paper again.\n\n25. This could indicate:\n    a) They've finally realized I've been exploiting their pattern and are changing strategy\n    b) It was a simple mistake and they'll return to their pattern\n    c) They're trying a new pattern\n\n26. Without more information, it's difficult to predict their next move with the same confidence as before.\n\n27. If they return to their pattern, they would play scissors next.\n    If they're starting a new pattern (e.g., paper repeating), they might play paper again.\n    If they're trying to counter my strategy, they might anticipate I'll play scissors (expecting them to play paper) and play rock instead.\n\n28. Given that they just broke a very long-established pattern, the most likely scenario is that they've recognized I was exploiting it and are now actively trying to counter me.\n\n29. If they think I'll continue to exploit what I think their pattern is (i.e., play scissors expecting paper), they'd play rock to beat my scissors.\n\n30. In this case of uncertainty, I should prioritize minimizing potential loss rather than maximizing gain.\n\n31. Playing rock would be safest - if they play scissors, I lose 1 point; if they play paper, I win 3 points; if they play rock, we tie.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Round 22: I played paper, opponent played paper. We tied, 0 points.\n23. Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point.\n\n24. Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n    - Round 21: Paper\n    - Round 22: Paper\n    - Round 23: Scissors\n\n25. After breaking their pattern in Round 22 (playing paper again instead of scissors), they've now played scissors in Round 23.\n\n26. This could indicate:\n    a) They delayed their pattern by one round (paper\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock)\n    b) They're trying to be unpredictable now\n    c) They're establishing a new pattern\n\n27. Without a clear pattern, I need to consider the overall distribution of their moves:\n    - Rock: appeared in many early rounds, and recently\n    - Paper: appeared frequently, including consecutive plays in Rounds 21-22\n    - Scissors: just played in Round 23\n\n28. Given that they just played scissors, if they're trying to be unpredictable, they might not play scissors again immediately.\n\n29. If they're returning to a pattern, they might play rock next (following scissors in their original pattern).\n\n30. If they play rock, my best response would be paper to avoid the -3 point loss.\n\n31. Playing paper would:\n    - Beat rock (if they return to pattern) for +1 point\n    - Lose to scissors (if they repeat) for -1 point\n    - Tie with paper for 0 points\n\n32. Given the uncertainty and my accumulated points from the streak of wins, I should prioritize avoiding major losses.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
