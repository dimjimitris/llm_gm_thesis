Let me try one more time to understand the rules:\n\nFrom the original rules:\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n\nIn the last round, I played rock and the opponent played scissors. According to these rules, scissors beats rock, so I correctly lost 1 point.\n\nI'll try to determine if there's a pattern in my opponent's moves. Recent opponent moves:\n- Round 16: scissors\n- Round 17: rock\n- Round 18: paper\n- Round 19: scissors\n\nIt does seem they're cycling through scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. If they continue this pattern, they should play rock next.\n\n[move] Paper\n\nI'm choosing paper because if they play rock next (following their apparent pattern), paper would beat rock according to the rules.\n"

According to these rules, rock beats paper, giving me -3 points, which matches the result.\n\nLet me verify my understanding again by looking at prior rounds:\n- When I played scissors and they played paper, I lost 1 point\n- When I played rock and they played scissors, I lost 1 point\n- When I played paper and they played rock, I lost 3 points\n\nThis suggests an interpretation of:\nRock > Paper > Scissors > Rock\n\nLet me try once more:\n\n[move] Scissors\n\nI'm selecting scissors because the opponent just played rock, and based on their pattern, they might play paper next, which scissors would beat.\n"
