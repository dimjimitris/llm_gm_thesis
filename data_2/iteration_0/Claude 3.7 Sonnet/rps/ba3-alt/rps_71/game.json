First, let me understand the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Same moves: Tie (0 points)\n\n2. This is not standard rock-paper-scissors because the payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Rock has the highest reward/penalty (+3/-3)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower rewards/penalties (+1/-1)\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I need to consider what a rational opponent might play:\n   - They might choose rock hoping for the highest reward\n   - They might avoid rock fearing the highest penalty\n   - They might assume I'll pick rock and choose paper to counter\n\n4. Let me consider my options:\n   - If I play rock: I get +3 if opponent picks paper, -1 if opponent picks scissors, 0 if opponent picks rock\n   - If I play paper: I get +1 if opponent picks scissors, -3 if opponent picks rock, 0 if opponent picks paper\n   - If I play scissors: I get +1 if opponent picks rock, -1 if opponent picks paper, 0 if opponent picks scissors\n\n5. Given the asymmetric rewards, rock has the highest potential gain but scissors offers a better balance of risk/reward:\n   - Scissors wins against rock (+1) and loses to paper (-1), a manageable downside\n   - Rock wins big against paper (+3) but loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Paper wins small against scissors (+1) but loses big to rock (-3)\n\n6. Since this is the first round with no prior information, scissors seems the most balanced option with limited downside.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors as my opening move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I lost and received -1 points.\n\n2. What does this tell me?\n   - My opponent made a move that counters scissors\n   - They might have anticipated my scissors play\n   - Or they simply prefer playing paper as an opening move\n\n3. Now I need to decide my next move. My opponent could:\n   - Continue playing paper, thinking I'll stick with scissors\n   - Switch to rock, anticipating I'll switch to paper to counter their previous paper\n   - Switch to scissors, anticipating I'll switch to rock\n\n4. If my opponent follows a pattern of countering what they think I'll play, they might expect me to switch to rock (to beat their paper), so they might play scissors.\n\n5. If my opponent is more straightforward, they might just play paper again since it worked last time.\n\n6. Let me assess my options:\n   - Rock would beat scissors if they switch to scissors (+3)\n   - Rock would lose to paper if they repeat paper (-3)\n   - Paper would beat rock if they switch to rock (+1)\n   - Paper would tie with paper if they repeat paper (0)\n   - Scissors would beat rock if they switch to rock (+1)\n   - Scissors would lose to paper if they repeat paper (-1)\n\n7. Since my opponent won with paper in the first round, there's a reasonable chance they'll play paper again. Rock would be risky against paper (-3). Scissors would lose again (-1). Paper would at least tie (0).\n\n8. The safest play with potential upside seems to be paper, as it either ties or wins.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

What patterns am I noticing?\n   - My opponent has played paper twice in a row\n   - They haven't played rock or scissors yet\n   - They might be favoring paper as a strategy\n\n4. Based on our history, my opponent might:\n   - Continue with paper for a third time, sticking to what's been working\n   - Anticipate that I'll switch to rock (to counter their paper trend), so they might switch to scissors\n   - Play randomly, in which case all moves are equally likely\n\n5. Let me consider my options:\n   - Rock would lose badly to scissors (-1) but beat paper significantly (+3)\n   - Paper would tie with paper (0) but lose badly to rock (-3)\n   - Scissors would beat paper (+1) but lose to rock (-1)\n\n6. Since my opponent has shown a clear preference for paper so far, scissors would be an effective counter, giving me +1 points if they continue their pattern.\n\n7.

Let me analyze the pattern:\n   - Round 1: Opponent played paper\n   - Round 2: Opponent played paper again\n   - Round 3: Opponent suddenly switched to rock\n\n3. This could indicate:\n   - My opponent is now reacting to my moves rather than following a predetermined pattern\n   - They might have expected me to play paper again in round 3 (to counter their paper), so they switched to rock\n   - They now know I played scissors in round 3, so they might anticipate scissors again\n\n4.

My opponent's pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: Paper\n   - Round 2: Paper\n   - Round 3: Rock\n   - Round 4: Paper\n   They've played paper 3 out of 4 times, suggesting a strong preference for paper.\n\n3.

For this round, my opponent might:\n   - Continue playing paper (their most frequent choice)\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I might play scissors to counter their paper preference\n   - Switch to scissors anticipating I might play paper again\n\n5.

This is strange - my opponent played rock again when I played scissors, which means they lost again in the same way. This is unexpected.\n\n3. My opponent's move pattern:\n   - Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Rock\n   They seem to be alternating between paper and rock, with paper being more common.\n\n4. What's most interesting is they played rock twice against my scissors, losing both times. This suggests either:\n   - They're playing a predetermined pattern regardless of my moves\n   - They're attempting a complex strategy I haven't discerned yet\n   - They might be making random moves\n\n5. Let's consider what they might do next:\n   - If following their alternating pattern, they would return to paper\n   - If they're learning from losses, they would avoid rock against my scissors\n   - If they're trying to establish a pattern to break later, they might continue with rock\n\n6.

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played paper, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played paper, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points)\n\n2. Re-examining the rules provided in the game description:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\n3. I was right about the reversal - paper beats scissors in this variant.\n\n4. Re-evaluating my opponent's move pattern:\n   - Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Paper\n   \n5. They've now played paper three times in a row, breaking the previous \"Paper, Paper, Rock\" pattern.\n\n6. It seems my opponent might be adapting to my moves rather than following a strict pattern. They might have noticed I keep playing scissors and are countering with paper.\n\n7. My conclusions:\n   - My opponent has played paper in 8 out of 11 rounds (73%)\n   - They've played rock in 3 out of 11 rounds (27%)\n   - They've never played scissors\n\n8. The most reliable strategy seems to be to play rock:\n   - Against paper (their most likely move): I win (+3)\n   - Against rock (their second choice): we tie (0)\n   - Against scissors (which they've never played): I lose (-1)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Wait, there's another critical misunderstanding in the rules. Let me review them again:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\n3. I just played rock against paper and won 3 points. This means rock beats paper in this variant.\n\n4. This suggests the rules actually are:\n   - Paper loses to scissors (-1 points for paper, +1 for scissors)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 points for rock, -3 for paper)\n   - Scissors loses to rock (-1 points for scissors, +1 for rock)\n\n5. This is almost standard RPS but with asymmetric scoring - rock/paper has higher stakes than the other matchups.\n\n6. Re-evaluating my opponent's moves with correct rule understanding:\n   - They've mostly played paper (9/12 rounds), which loses badly to rock\n   - When I played scissors they sometimes countered with rock\n   - They've consistently favored paper regardless of my moves\n\n7. Given their strong preference for paper, rock remains the optimal play:\n   - Against paper (their most common move): I win (+3)\n   - Against rock (their occasional counter): I lose (-1)\n   - Against scissors (which they've never played): I win (+3)\n\n8. The expected value of playing rock is clearly positive given their historical moves.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This latest result suggests my most recent understanding was incorrect. Let me carefully reread the rules:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\n3. I misread these rules again. The correct interpretation is:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Paper wins (+1), scissors loses (-1)\n   - Rock beats paper: Rock wins (+3), paper loses (-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock: Scissors wins (+1), rock loses (-1)\n\n4. So scissors beats rock, which explains why I lost in the last round.\n\n5. The opponent has never played scissors before, and chose this round to play it for the first time.\n\n6. Analyzing their complete pattern:\n   - Paper (9 times)\n   - Rock (3 times)\n   - Scissors (1 time)\n   \n7. They seem to be adapting their strategy:\n   - Used paper frequently early on\n   - After I switched to rock and won big, they immediately countered with scissors\n\n8. My opponent appears to be reactive and strategic rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\n9. For my next move:\n   - If they continue adapting, they might play scissors again since it just worked\n   - They might return to paper, their most frequent move\n   - They might try rock as another option\n\n10. My options:\n    - Paper beats scissors but loses badly to rock\n    - Rock beats paper but loses to scissors\n    - Scissors loses to paper but beats rock\n\n11. Since they just played scissors for the first time and won, they might play scissors again. Paper would be the counter to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I'm completely confused about the rules. Let me try once more to understand:\n   - I just played paper vs. scissors and won (+1)\n   - Previously, I played rock vs. paper and won (+3)\n   - Earlier, I played scissors vs. rock and won (+1)\n\n3. This suggests a completely reversed version of Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n4. This is the exact opposite of standard RPS, which would mean:\n   - Scissors loses to paper\n   - Paper loses to rock\n   - Rock loses to scissors\n\n5. It appears the opponent is now playing scissors consecutively (rounds 13 and 14) after previously favoring paper.\n\n6. They seem to be trying different strategies:\n   - Started with mostly paper\n   - Then tried scissors after I played rock\n   - Continued with scissors even though it lost\n\n7. They might:\n   - Continue with scissors for a third time\n   - Switch back to paper (their most frequent move)\n   - Try rock (used occasionally)\n\n8. If they play scissors again, paper would win (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper, rock would win (+3)\n   - If they switch to rock, scissors would win (+1)\n\n9. Paper seems to be a reasonable choice given their recent scissors plays, and rock would give me the biggest reward if they return to paper.\n\n10. Since they've now played scissors twice in a row, and I just beat them with paper, they're likely to change strategy.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round, anticipating they might switch back to paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Since they've shown a persistent preference for scissors lately, even after losing, paper remains the best counter.\n\n9. If they're becoming frustrated with losing and decide to change strategy, they might switch to rock to counter my paper. But this seems less likely given their persistence with scissors.\n\n10. The safest play remains paper, which will win against scissors (+1) and tie against paper (0), with the only significant risk being against rock (-3).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper again for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played paper, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played paper, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 points)\n\n2. My opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 15: rock\n   - Round 16: scissors\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: rock\n\n3. The opponent has now played rock twice in a row, after previously showing adaptive behavior.\n\n4. Interestingly, they played rock again even after losing to my scissors in the previous round.\n\n5. My opponent's play has evolved through several phases:\n   - Early game: Heavy paper emphasis\n   - Mid-game: Shift to scissors\n   - Recent: Increased rock usage despite losses\n\n6. Their persistence with rock despite losing suggests either:\n   - A deliberate strategy to establish a pattern before breaking it\n   - They're expecting me to switch from scissors after winning\n   - They're becoming less adaptive and more stubborn\n\n7. I've noticed I've won with scissors against rock several times (rounds 3, 5, 8, 19).\n\n8. Given that they've played rock twice consecutively, even after losing:\n   - They might play rock again (persistence)\n   - They might switch to paper (their historically most common move)\n   - They might switch to scissors (to counter anticipated scissors play)\n\n9. If I play scissors again:\n   - Against rock: I win (+1)\n   - Against paper: I lose (-1)\n   - Against scissors: I tie (0)\n\n10. The risk/reward of scissors seems favorable given their recent rock preference, and the limited downside if they switch.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 16: scissors\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: rock\n   - Round 20: paper\n\n3. The opponent has now played different moves in the last three rounds: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper.\n\n4. They seem to be strategically adapting to counter my moves, as they switched from rock to paper right after I successfully used scissors.\n\n5. Overall move distribution by opponent:\n   - Paper: 11 times\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   - Scissors: 4 times\n\n6. Their pattern appears to be actively adaptive rather than random or fixed:\n   - They seem to be watching my moves and responding\n   - When I win with a particular strategy, they adapt in the next round\n\n7. Since they just countered my scissors with paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to rock if they think I'll counter with paper\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll counter with rock\n\n8. Given their recent adaptability, I should avoid being predictable.\n\n9. Rock would be a strong move:\n   - Against paper (their most recent and historically most common move): I win big (+3)\n   - Against rock: we tie (0)\n   - Against scissors: I lose moderately (-1)\n\n10. Rock offers the highest potential reward while limiting potential losses.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Wait, I've encountered a critical contradiction:\n   - In round 12, I played rock vs. paper and won (+3)\n   - In round 21, I played rock vs. paper and won (+3)\n   - Both contradict the rule I thought we were playing by: \"rock beats paper\"\n\n3. Let me try to reconcile my understanding of the rules. The stated rules were:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\n4. It seems I've been misinterpreting the rule structure. The correct reading appears to be:\n   - Paper loses to scissors (scissors +1, paper -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (rock +3, paper -3)\n   - Scissors loses to rock (rock +1, scissors -1)\n\n5. This would explain my consistent success with rock against paper.\n\n6. My opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: rock\n   - Round 20: paper\n   - Round 21: paper\n\n7. They've played paper twice in a row now, even though they lost badly with it in the previous round.\n\n8. Their overall pattern suggests persistence with certain moves regardless of outcomes.\n\n9. Given their repeated paper play despite losses, rock remains the optimal choice:\n   - Against paper (their most recent move): I win significantly (+3)\n   - Against rock: we tie (0)\n   - Against scissors: I lose minimally (-1)\n\n10. The risk/reward heavily favors rock given their persistent paper play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The opponent has now played rock\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192paper\u2192scissors, showing what appears to be a systematic rotation through all three moves.\n\n4. They're demonstrating adaptive behavior - after losing twice with paper against my rock, they switched to scissors and won.\n\n5. If they're following a pattern of cycling or responding to my moves:\n   - After success with scissors against my rock, they might:\n     a) Continue with scissors (persistence after success)\n     b) Anticipate I'll switch to paper and play rock\n     c) Return to paper (their historically most frequent move)\n\n6. My success rate with different moves:\n   - Scissors: 4 wins, 6 losses, 0 ties\n   - Paper: 1 win, 2 losses, 3 ties\n   - Rock: 2 wins, 3 losses, 1 tie\n\n7. Paper appears to be the safest option:\n   - Against scissors (their most recent move): I win (+1)\n   - Against paper: we tie (0)\n   - Against rock: I lose (-3)\n\n8.

They've played scissors twice in a row now, even though they lost with it in the previous round.\n\n6. Their overall pattern doesn't show clear logic - they often persist with moves despite losses.\n\n7. Given that they've played scissors twice consecutively, even after losing:\n   - They might continue with scissors for a third time (persistence)\n   - They might switch to paper (historically their most common move)\n   - They might switch to rock (to counter anticipated paper from me)\n\n8. Paper performed well against scissors in the last round, and I should continue with what works.\n\n9. If I play paper again:\n   - Against scissors (their recent preference): I win (+1)\n   - Against paper: we tie (0)\n   - Against rock: I lose (-3)\n\n10.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
