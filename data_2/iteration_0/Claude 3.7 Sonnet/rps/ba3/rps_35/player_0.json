Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Review the payoff structure: \n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in a tie with no points\n\n2. Analyze the payoff asymmetry:\n   - Paper beating rock has the highest reward/penalty (3 points)\n   - The other matchups have lower stakes (1 point)\n\n3. Consider my strategy for the first move:\n   - I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) if my opponent plays rock\n   - Rock is risky because losing to paper costs 3 points\n   - Scissors is safer in terms of potential loss, but has a lower maximum gain\n\n4. Since this is the first round with no information about my opponent's tendencies, I'll make a strategic choice based on the payoff structure.\n\n5. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, as it feels \"strong.\" If my opponent follows this tendency, playing paper would be optimal.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper since it has the highest potential reward against a common first move (rock), and the risk seems reasonable for the first round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyze their complete pattern again:\n   - Paper-Scissors-Paper-Scissors-Paper-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Paper-Scissors\n   - The pattern paper-scissors appears consistently throughout\n   - After their brief deviation to rock in round 6, they've essentially returned to their original alternating pattern\n\n3. Examine pattern confirmation:\n   - They've played scissors in rounds 2, 4, 8, and 10\n   - They've played paper in rounds 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9\n   - The rock move in round 6 appears to be an anomaly\n   - Strong evidence suggests they're using an alternating paper-scissors pattern\n\n4. Predict with high confidence:\n   - Based on the established pattern, they will almost certainly play paper next\n   - Their commitment to this pattern has been very consistent apart from one round\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play paper (highly likely): scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they play scissors (breaking pattern): rock wins (+1)\n   - If they play rock (unlikely): paper wins (+3)\n   - The pattern is now clear enough that scissors is the optimal choice\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, confidently expecting them to play paper in accordance with their well-established alternating pattern.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Analyze the updated sequence:\n   - Their full sequence: Paper-Scissors-Paper-Scissors-Paper-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Paper-Scissors-Paper-Rock\n   - The rock move breaks their paper-scissors pattern again\n   - Interestingly, they've played rock exactly twice: in rounds 6 and 12\n   - This could suggest a longer pattern: 5 alternations of paper-scissors, then rock\n\n3.

Analyze the confirmed pattern:\n   - They continue to follow their predominant paper-scissors alternation\n   - After paper, they've played scissors 6/9 times\n   - Their recent sequence (paper-scissors-paper) follows their most common pattern\n\n3. Calculate my performance:\n   - I've won 10 rounds (+10 points)\n   - Tied 9 rounds (0 points)\n   - Lost 0 rounds\n   - My strategy remains highly effective\n\n4.

Strategic decision:\n   - If they play scissors (most likely based on history): rock wins (+1)\n   - If they play rock (less likely but possible): paper wins (+3)\n   - If they play paper again (least likely): scissors wins (+1)\n   - Rock offers the best balance of probability and reward\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, anticipating they'll continue their paper-scissors alternation and play scissors next.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
