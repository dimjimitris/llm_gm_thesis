Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The last result is confusing. I played rock against scissors and lost, which contradicts my understanding of the rules where rock should beat scissors.\n\n3. Given the previous rounds' outcomes, I need to revisit my understanding of the rules:\n   - In Round 7: I played rock vs scissors and lost (-1 point)\n   - In Round 12: I played rock vs scissors and lost (-1 point)\n   - In Round 8: I played scissors vs rock and won (+1 point)\n   - In Round 11: I played scissors vs rock and won (+1 point)\n\n4. This consistently shows that scissors beats rock (not the other way around).\n\n5. The correct rule interpretation must be:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n6.

Looking at their most recent moves:\n   rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n4. They seem to be mirroring my moves in the last few rounds, resulting in ties. This could be intentional.\n\n5. My current point total remains at 2 points after another tie.\n\n6. We've had three consecutive ties now, which suggests they might be trying to read and match my moves.\n\n7. If they're mirroring my moves, they might expect me to play paper again and match with paper. Or they might expect me to switch to scissors (to beat their paper) and counter with rock.\n\n8. To break this pattern of ties, I need to make a less predictable move.\n\n9. Since they played paper last round, they might expect me to play scissors this time. If they anticipate this and play rock, scissors would lose.\n\n10. However, if they're truly trying to mirror my moves, they might play scissors expecting me to play scissors.\n\n11. Given the recent pattern of ties and potential mirroring, rock seems to be the safest choice as it would beat scissors if they attempt to mirror and would tie with rock if they try to counter my expected scissors play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

I won with rock against paper, which confirms rock beats paper in this game.\n\n3. My opponent's complete sequence has been:\n   rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n4. Looking at their most recent moves:\n   scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n5. They've played paper twice in a row now, breaking from their previous mirroring strategy.\n\n6. My current point total is: -1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + (-1) + 0 + 0 + 1 + (-1) + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3\n\n7. Since they've played paper twice consecutively, they might:\n   - Play paper again (continuing the streak)\n   - Switch to rock or scissors (to break predictability)\n\n8. Against paper, I should play rock (rock beats paper).\n   Against rock, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock).\n   Against scissors, I should play paper (paper beats scissors).\n\n9. If they're continuing to play paper, rock would be the best choice. But they might anticipate this and switch to scissors to counter my expected rock play.\n\n10. Given they've played paper twice in a row, they're more likely to switch to something else. Rock has been their most frequent choice throughout the game.\n\n11. If they switch to rock, scissors would be the optimal move.\n\n12. Weighing these possibilities, scissors seems to be the best strategic choice for this round.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
