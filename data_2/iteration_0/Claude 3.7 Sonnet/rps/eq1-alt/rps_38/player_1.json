    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In Rock-Paper-Scissors, there is no inherently dominant strategy when playing against a random opponent.\n2. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history between us, I don't have data on their tendencies.\n3. According to game theory, the optimal strategy against an unknown opponent is to play randomly with equal probability for each option.\n4. However, psychological studies suggest that Rock is often the most common first move among new players, as it symbolizes strength.\n5. If the opponent chooses Rock, my best counter would be Paper.\n6. There's also a slight tendency for sophisticated players to choose Paper in the first round, anticipating the Rock tendency.\n7. If the opponent chooses Paper, my best counter would be Scissors.\n8. Considering these factors, I'll choose Scissors as my first move, anticipating a possibility that my opponent might choose Paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

This could mean either:\n   a) The rules have been reversed for this game variant\n   b) There was a mistake in the outcome description\n6. Given the information provided, I should assume the rules might be reversed (Rock < Scissors < Paper < Rock).\n7. If my opponent played Rock last time, they might:\n   a) Stick with Rock since it worked for them\n   b) Switch to Paper expecting me to play Rock\n   c) Switch to Scissors anticipating I might play Paper\n8.

Let's review what has happened so far:\n   - Round 1: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 3: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, I lost (-1)\n\n2. Let me restate the rules as given:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\n3. I think I misinterpreted these. The rules should be read as:\n   - Paper LOSES TO Scissors: Scissors player gets +1, Paper player gets -1\n   - Rock LOSES TO Paper: Paper player gets +1, Rock player gets -1\n   - Scissors LOSES TO Rock: Rock player gets +1, Scissors player gets -1\n\n4. So the correct cycle is the standard: Rock > Scissors > Paper > Rock\n\n5. Re-analyzing previous rounds with this understanding:\n   - Round 1: My Scissors vs their Rock - I should have lost, but was told I won\n   - Round 2: My Scissors vs their Paper - I should have won, but was told I lost\n   - Round 3: My Rock vs their Scissors - I should have won, but was told I lost\n\n6. There's still inconsistency. Let me try one more interpretation - maybe the rules are presented backward:\n   - \"Paper beats scissors\" means Scissors beats Paper\n   - \"Rock beats paper\" means Paper beats Rock\n   - \"Scissors beats rock\" means Rock beats Scissors\n\n7. This would match standard RPS rules. I'll proceed with standard RPS strategy.\n\n8. My opponent seems to be following a pattern: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ?\n   They might continue with Rock next, following the cycle.

Looking at who wins with what combinations:\n   - Scissors vs Rock: Scissors wins\n   - Scissors vs Paper: Paper wins\n   - Rock vs Scissors: Scissors wins\n   - Paper vs Rock: Rock wins\n\n3. This gives us the winning pattern: Scissors > Rock, Paper > Scissors, Scissors > Rock, Rock > Paper\n\n4. This is neither standard RPS nor a consistent reverse. But looking at the game rules again:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\n5. Wait - I think I've been misreading. This is saying:\n   - Paper loses to Scissors\n   - Rock loses to Paper\n   - Scissors loses to Rock\n\n6.

Analyzing my results with standard RPS rules:\n   - Round 1: Scissors vs Rock - I should have lost, but was told I won\n   - Round 2: Scissors vs Paper - I should have won, but was told I lost\n   - Round 3: Rock vs Scissors - I should have won, but was told I lost\n   - Round 4: Paper vs Rock - I should have won, but was told I lost\n\n8. It seems the results are consistently reversed! The loser is being told they won and vice versa.\n\n9. My opponent has played: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   This follows a simple cycle. They might play Paper next.\n\n10.

Let me extract just the win/lose pattern, ignoring the moves:\n   - Round 1: I won\n   - Rounds 2-5: I lost\n\n3.

I expected them to play Scissors, but they played Paper. This means their pattern has shifted again.\n\n4. Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 10-12: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n\n5. It seems they may be reverting to the alternating Rock-Paper pattern they showed in rounds 4-8.\n\n6. Under the reversed rules I've been working with:\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n\n7. However, I just won with Rock against their Paper, which contradicts my understanding of \"Rock beats Paper giving the winner 1 point...\" which I interpreted as Paper losing to Rock.\n\n8. Let me reconsider the rules as stated:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\n9. These statements are ambiguous in terms of who is the winner. Let me look at all winning combinations:\n   - I won with Scissors vs Rock (rounds 1, 8, 11)\n   - I won with Rock vs Paper (round 12)\n   \n   This matches the standard RPS rules (Scissors > Paper > Rock > Scissors), not reversed rules!\n\n10. If standard RPS rules apply and they continue the R-P alternation, they'll likely play Rock next.\n\n11. In standard RPS, to beat Rock, I should play Paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I notice they've played Paper in rounds 14, 17, and 19. This suggests they might be favoring Paper more frequently.\n\n7.
