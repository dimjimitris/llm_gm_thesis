    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a critical change! For the first time, my opponent broke their pattern by playing rock after scissors instead of the expected paper.\n\n4. This suggests they've finally adapted their strategy after a long losing streak, likely recognizing that I was anticipating their moves.\n\n5. Now I need to reassess. After winning with rock against my scissors, their possible next moves are:\n   - Stay with rock (building on success)\n   - Switch to paper (anticipating I might play rock)\n   - Switch to scissors (anticipating I might play paper)\n\n6. Given that they just broke their pattern successfully, they might:\n   - Continue to break patterns to be unpredictable\n   - Return to their original pattern, thinking I'll expect them to continue being unpredictable\n   - Build a new pattern starting with this rock move\n\n7. With this disruption, I need a new approach. Since they just succeeded with rock, psychology suggests they might stick with it (the \"win-stay\" principle).\n\n8. Alternatively, they might expect me to play paper to counter their rock, and thus play scissors.\n\n9. Given this uncertainty after the pattern break, I should make a strategic choice that works well against their most likely moves.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, anticipating they will either stay with rock after their success or return to their original pattern which would predict scissors (which paper would lose to). Paper beats rock and loses to scissors, but rock seems more probable given their recent success with it.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I won (+1)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won (+1)\n   - My current total score is +13 points\n\n2. The opponent's pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. I've now won five consecutive rounds, and the opponent appears to have largely returned to their original cyclical pattern after the brief disruption in round 13.\n\n4. After losing with scissors against my rock, their likely responses are:\n   - Switch to rock (to tie if I play rock again)\n   - Switch to paper (to beat the rock they might expect me to play again)\n   - Stay with scissors (extremely unlikely after just losing with it)\n\n5. Looking at their historical pattern, they consistently followed scissors with paper in their original pattern sequence.\n\n6. Despite their long losing streak, they've shown a strong tendency to revert to their pattern, suggesting they either:\n   - Don't recognize they're following a predictable pattern\n   - Can't help following this pattern despite losses\n   - Are programmed to follow this pattern (if this is an automated opponent)\n\n7. Given their remarkably consistent behavior throughout most of the game, paper remains their most probable next move after scissors.\n\n8. To counter paper, I should play scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, anticipating they will follow their strong historical pattern and play paper after scissors, as they have done consistently throughout most of our match.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
