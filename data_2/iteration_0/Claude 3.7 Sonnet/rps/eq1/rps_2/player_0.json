The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

            "text": "[move] Paper\n\nI continue to face an exceptionally challenging opponent who has consistently anticipated my moves. They've just played rock to counter my scissors.\n\nFor this round, I'm choosing paper. This would counter their rock if they maintain that choice. I've tried various strategies throughout our game - responding to their previous move, attempting to introduce unpredictability, and looking for patterns - but my opponent has demonstrated remarkable ability to stay one step ahead.\n\nRather than overthinking, I'm making this choice based primarily on countering their most recent move while acknowledging that they've shown they can adapt to whatever strategy I employ. Paper is the logical counter to their last move of rock.\n"

They've just used scissors to counter my paper.\n\nFor this round, I'm selecting rock, which directly counters their previous scissors move. While they've consistently stayed ahead of my strategic adjustments throughout our game, I'm focusing on making a sound choice based on their most recent action. Rock beats scissors, so this represents a logical response to their last move. I recognize that they may anticipate this adjustment, but I need to maintain strategic reasoning while trying to disrupt their successful prediction pattern.\n"
