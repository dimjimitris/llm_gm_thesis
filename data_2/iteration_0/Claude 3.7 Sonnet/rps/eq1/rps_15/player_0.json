    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which means this is our first interaction, so I have no prior history to base my decision on.\n2. In rock-paper-scissors without any prior information, no single move has an inherent advantage.\n3. The standard game theory approach suggests that the optimal strategy is to randomly select moves with equal probability.\n4. However, human players often have tendencies. Many inexperienced players tend to choose rock as their first move.\n5. Paper would beat rock if they choose that.\n6. But this is just a tendency, not a certainty.\n7. Since I have no specific information about my opponent yet, a balanced approach seems best.\n8. I will choose paper for my first move, as it beats rock (which is a common first choice) and establishes a starting point for potential pattern recognition in future rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

One common pattern in rock-paper-scissors is that players often repeat a winning move, thinking it will work again.\n4. If my opponent follows this pattern, they might play scissors again.\n5. The optimal counter to scissors would be rock.\n6. Another possibility is that my opponent might anticipate that I'll switch to rock to counter their previous scissors, so they might switch to paper.\n7. However, without more data points, it's hard to determine if they're using a sophisticated strategy or simple patterns.\n8.

Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n3. Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n4. Rounds 4-23: I correctly predicted and countered my opponent's moves in every round\n5. My opponent has maintained a strict scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper rotation for 23 consecutive rounds without any deviation\n6. Their most recent move was rock, following the established pattern\n7. If they continue this perfectly consistent pattern, their next move would be paper\n8. To counter paper, I should play scissors\n9. I've now won twenty-one consecutive rounds by correctly anticipating their pattern\n10. The pattern has remained absolutely consistent throughout our entire game, showing no adaptation or change in strategy despite consistent losses\n11. Based on the overwhelming evidence of their unchanging behavior, continuing with my counter-strategy is the optimal choice\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors to counter their anticipated paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
