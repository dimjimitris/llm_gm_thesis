    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In this game, I'm playing against a fresh player, meaning we have no prior history to analyze.\n2. The classic \"rock, paper, scissors\" game is traditionally viewed as a game of chance with equal probabilities when both players are playing randomly.\n3. Without any prior information about my opponent's tendencies, there is no move that gives me a statistical advantage.\n4. In the first round, some players might default to \"rock\" as it's psychologically perceived as strong or is mentioned first in the game's name.\n5. However, if my opponent is also thinking strategically, they might anticipate this and choose \"paper\" to counter.\n6. Given these considerations, I could choose any move with equal expected value, but I'll select \"paper\" as my opening move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for the first round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Option (c) seems most likely - players often counter the previous winning move.\n5. If I think my opponent will play scissors, my best response would be rock.\n6. However, this is still early in the game, and my opponent might be using basic patterns or could be employing a more sophisticated strategy.\n7.

My opponent's sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n3.

Opponent's patterns:\n   a) Their pattern continues with perfect consistency following the rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle\n   b) They just played paper and lost to my scissors\n   c) Based on their established cycle, they should play rock next\n   d) They've maintained this exact pattern despite losing 16 rounds in a row\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   a) Looking at what they played after paper:\n      - Round 3 paper (tie) \u2192 Round 4 scissors\n      - Round 6 paper (lost) \u2192 Round 7 rock\n      - Round 9 paper (lost) \u2192 Round 10 rock\n      - Round 12 paper (lost) \u2192 Round 13 rock\n      - Round 15 paper (lost) \u2192 Round 16 rock\n      - Round 18 paper (lost) \u2192 Round 19 rock\n      - Round 21 paper (lost) \u2192 Round 22 ?\n   b) With only one exception in early rounds, they've consistently played rock after paper\n\n6. Psychological considerations:\n   a) After losing 16 rounds in a row, they've proven beyond any doubt they're using a fixed pattern\n   b) It's absolutely certain they'll continue their rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle\n   c) The probability they'll play rock next is effectively 100% based on their pattern\n\n7. If I predict they'll play rock next (continuing their rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle), my optimal counter would be paper.\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   a) If they somehow break pattern and play scissors, my paper would lose\n   b) If they break pattern and play paper again, my paper would tie\n   c) If they play rock as predicted by their consistent cycle, my paper would win\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their certain rock move.\n\n[move] paper\n"
