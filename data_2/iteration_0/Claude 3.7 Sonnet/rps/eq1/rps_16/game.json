I'm playing against a fresh player, which means there's no prior history to analyze.\n2. In the absence of information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider the basic game theory of Rock Paper Scissors.\n3. In theory, the optimal strategy for Rock Paper Scissors is to choose moves with equal probability (1/3 for each option).\n4. However, psychological factors can influence first moves. Studies suggest that rock is a common first move for many players, as it feels \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n5. If my opponent plays rock as their first move, paper would be the best counter.\n6. There's no way to predict with certainty what they'll choose, but I can make an educated guess based on common patterns.\n7. Given this is the first move with no prior information, I'll choose paper as it counters the psychologically favored first move (rock).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This could indicate several things:\n   a) My opponent anticipated my paper play\n   b) They randomly chose scissors\n   c) They might have a preference for scissors as a first move\n3. After losing with paper against scissors, there's a psychological pattern where players often shift to the move that would have beaten their previous move.\n4. Since scissors beat my paper, I might be psychologically inclined to play rock next (which beats scissors).\n5. However, if my opponent is strategic, they might anticipate this and play paper to counter my expected rock.\n6. Another common pattern is that players often repeat winning moves, so my opponent might play scissors again.\n7. To counter potential scissors repetition, playing rock would be optimal.\n8. Weighing these considerations, the strongest evidence points to my opponent either repeating their winning scissors move or expecting me to switch to rock (and thus playing paper).\n9. Playing rock seems like the most strategic choice as it would beat scissors if repeated, and tie with rock if they also make the same reasoning I did.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has played scissors twice in a row, which suggests one of the following:\n   a) They have a strong preference for scissors\n   b) They're using a predetermined pattern\n   c) It could be coincidental\n4. Players often change their move after losing, so my opponent might switch from scissors to something else.\n5. Since they lost with scissors against my rock, they might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper.\n6. Another possibility is that they might assume I'll predict their switch and try to stay one step ahead.\n7. I could stick with rock if I believe they'll play scissors a third time, but this seems unlikely.\n8. If they switch to paper (expecting my rock), then scissors would be my best counter.\n9. If they switch to rock (breaking their pattern completely), then paper would be best.\n10. The most likely scenario based on typical RPS psychology is that they'll switch to paper to counter my previous rock.\n11.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
