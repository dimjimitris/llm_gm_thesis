    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the point structure:\n   - Paper beating rock: 3 points (highest reward)\n   - Rock beating scissors: 1 point (lower reward)\n   - Scissors beating paper: 1 point (lower reward)\n\n3. Considering the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points)\n   - Paper only risks losing 1 point if opponent plays scissors\n   - Rock and scissors only offer 1 point reward\n   - Rock risks losing 3 points to paper\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Paper offers the best risk/reward ratio\n   - Even if I lose with paper, I only lose 1 point\n   - If I win with paper, I gain 3 points\n   - This makes paper the most attractive first move\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - With no information about opponent\n   - And paper having the best payoff potential\n   - Paper seems like the optimal choice\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analysis of last round:\n   - Opponent played paper\n   - This suggests they might have made similar strategic calculations\n   - Or they might favor paper as an opening move\n\n2. Psychology assessment:\n   - After a tie, players often change their move\n   - Opponent might expect me to switch to either rock or scissors\n   - If they think I'll switch to rock, they'll keep paper\n   - If they think I'll switch to scissors, they'll switch to rock\n\n3. Payoff consideration:\n   - If I play scissors and they keep paper: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they switch to rock: I lose 1 point\n   - If I keep paper and they switch to rock: I win 3 points\n   - If I keep paper and they switch to scissors: I lose 1 point\n\n4. Strategy formation:\n   - Most players tend to change after a tie\n   - However, changing to scissors only gives small reward\n   - Keeping paper maintains threat of high reward\n   - Rock seems least advantageous as opening with rock is risky\n\n5.

Pattern is absolute:\n   - Their moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - Following perfect rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle\n   - Pattern has held for multiple rounds\n   - Next in cycle would be scissors\n   - No deviation from pattern despite losses\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n   - Down 24 points\n   - Completely locked in pattern\n   - Shows no signs of strategic thinking\n   - Appears to have surrendered to pattern\n   - Mental state likely:\n     a) Complete autopilot\n     b) Given up on winning\n     c) Just going through motions\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - Pattern is overwhelmingly strong\n   - No indication they'll break it\n   - Following pattern, they will play scissors\n   - Even if they break pattern now:\n     a) Too late to affect outcome\n     b) Would be their first deviation in many rounds\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Pattern indicates scissors from them\n   - Rock would:\n     - Beat their predicted scissors (+1)\n     - Only lose to paper (-3)\n     - Continue perfect counter-sequence\n   - Pattern is too strong to ignore\n   - No rational reason to deviate from counter-strategy\n\n[move] rock\n"

Strategic analysis:\n   - Pattern reliability is 100%\n   - Paper will be their next move\n   - No logical reason to expect deviation\n   - Pattern has become their only strategy\n   - Breaking pattern now would be irrational\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Pattern dictates paper from them\n   - Scissors would:\n     - Beat their predictable paper play (+1)\n     - Continue perfect counter-sequence\n     - Maintain complete strategic dominance\n   - Following their perfect pattern\n   - No reason to deviate from winning strategy\n\n[move] scissors\n"
