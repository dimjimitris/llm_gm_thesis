Considering the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points)\n   - Paper only risks losing 1 point if opponent plays scissors\n   - Rock and scissors only offer 1 point reward\n   - Rock risks losing 3 points to paper\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Paper offers the best risk/reward ratio\n   - Even if I lose with paper, I only lose 1 point\n   - If I win with paper, I gain 3 points\n   - This makes paper the most attractive first move\n\n5.

Analysis of last round:\n   - Opponent played paper\n   - This suggests they might have made similar strategic calculations\n   - Or they might favor paper as an opening move\n\n2. Psychology assessment:\n   - After a tie, players often change their move\n   - Opponent might expect me to switch to either rock or scissors\n   - If they think I'll switch to rock, they'll keep paper\n   - If they think I'll switch to scissors, they'll switch to rock\n\n3. Payoff consideration:\n   - If I play scissors and they keep paper: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they switch to rock: I lose 1 point\n   - If I keep paper and they switch to rock: I win 3 points\n   - If I keep paper and they switch to scissors: I lose 1 point\n\n4. Strategy formation:\n   - Most players tend to change after a tie\n   - However, changing to scissors only gives small reward\n   - Keeping paper maintains threat of high reward\n   - Rock seems least advantageous as opening with rock is risky\n\n5.
