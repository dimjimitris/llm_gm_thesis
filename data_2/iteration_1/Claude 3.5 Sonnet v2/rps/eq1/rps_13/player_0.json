    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer: Skilled at identifying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Assessor: Evaluates risk-reward scenarios\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, when playing against a fresh opponent with no prior history, the optimal strategy is often to start with a balanced approach. Since we have no information about the opponent's tendencies, any systematic bias could be exploited.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Since this is the first move and we have no historical data to analyze, we can't make any predictions based on patterns. We should focus on a move that gives us reasonable coverage.\n\nRisk Assessor: Looking at the payoff matrix, each move has equal risk-reward potential (1 point for winning, -1 for losing, 0 for tie). In this case, I would suggest avoiding any obvious biases that could be exploited in future rounds.\n\nGame Strategist: Rock is often a common first move for many players as it feels \"strong.\" We could either mirror this expected behavior or try to counter it with paper.\n\nPattern Analyzer: While that's true, we shouldn't overthink the first move too much. The opponent is also starting fresh and likely going through similar considerations.\n\nRisk Assessor: I suggest going with rock for the first move. It's a solid opening that gives us a good foundation to adapt our strategy based on the opponent's response.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

They might be using a similar strategic thinking process (predicting rock as a common first move)\n2. They might favor paper as their preferred opening\n3. Or it could be completely random\n\nGame Strategist: Since we lost the first round, we need to adapt. The opponent has shown they can think strategically by countering a common opening move. We have two main options:\n1. Play scissors to counter their paper if they repeat\n2. Assume they'll expect us to switch to scissors and will switch to rock themselves\n\nRisk Assessor: The opponent demonstrated good strategic thinking in round 1. Given that sophisticated players often avoid repeating the same move, I believe they're likely to switch. However, they might also try to double-bluff by sticking with paper.\n\nPattern Analyzer: In Rock-Paper-Scissors, players often switch after a win. This is a common psychological pattern. Therefore, there's a good chance they'll switch from paper to something else.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these considerations, I recommend playing rock again. Here's why:\n1. If they switch to scissors (common after a win), we win\n2. If they stick with paper (less likely), we lose again\n3. If they switch to rock, we tie and gather more information\n\nRisk Assessor: I agree. Playing rock again might seem counter-intuitive, but it provides good coverage against likely opponent moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

This establishes a clear pattern that could mean:\n1. They are consistently using paper as their dominant strategy\n2. They've identified our tendency to play rock and are exploiting it\n3. They're building a pattern deliberately to bait us into a specific response\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown remarkable consistency and might be:\n- Very confident in their strategy\n- Trying to condition us to expect paper\n- Testing if we're capable of adapting\n\nRisk Assessor: We've lost two points now by failing to adapt. Continuing with the same strategy would be extremely risky. The obvious counter to two consecutive papers is scissors, but we need to consider if this is a trap.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychology of RPS suggests that after two identical successful moves, players often:\n1. Stick with their winning move out of confidence\n2. Switch because they think their pattern has become too predictable\n\nGame Strategist: The key principle here is pattern breaking. We must not fall into the trap of being predictable ourselves. After two losses with rock, we need to change our strategy.\n\nRisk Assessor: Given the demonstrated pattern and our accumulated losses, the risk of not adapting is greater than the risk of falling into a potential trap. I strongly recommend playing scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Even if this is a trap and they switch to rock, we need to show we can adapt. Playing scissors is our best option to counter their established pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They might be using a very simple strategy\n3. They might not be adapting their strategy even after losing\n\nGame Strategist: The win validates our decision to finally adapt, but now we're at a critical decision point. After their first loss:\n1. They might finally switch away from paper\n2. They might stubbornly stick to paper, thinking we wouldn't expect it four times in a row\n3. They might be playing a completely non-adaptive strategy\n\nRisk Assessor: We've seen three papers in a row, which is highly unusual for a strategic player. This suggests either:\n- A fixed-strategy bot\n- A very inexperienced player\n- Or a very clever player setting up for a major strategy shift\n\nPattern Analyzer: In RPS, players typically change their move after a loss. However, if this is a non-adaptive opponent, they might continue with paper.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the consistent pattern and the psychological impact of just losing, I recommend sticking with scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they're non-adaptive, we win again\n2. If they switch to rock (common after losing), we lose but gather valuable information\n3. If they switch to scissors, we tie and maintain our position\n\nRisk Assessor: I agree.

They may have been baiting us to continue using scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Their move sequence so far has been: paper-paper-paper-rock. This change after their first loss is significant and suggests they're playing with some strategy, not randomly.\n\nRisk Assessor: We're now at -1 points total (lost-lost-won-lost). The opponent has demonstrated they:\n- Can maintain a consistent strategy (3 papers)\n- Can adapt when needed\n- Might have predicted our scissors play after their loss\n\nPattern Analyzer: Classic RPS psychology suggests that after successfully breaking a pattern (their switch to rock), players often:\n1. Return to their preferred move (paper in their case)\n2. Continue with their successful new move (rock)\n3. Complete a full cycle by switching to scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated strategic capability, I suggest playing paper. Here's why:\n1.

They might return to their originally successful paper strategy\n3. They might stubbornly stick with rock, thinking we'll expect a change\n\nRisk Assessor: Our score is now even (0 points total). Their behavior suggests a fairly straightforward, pattern-based player who:\n- Can stick to a strategy for multiple rounds\n- Eventually adapts, but perhaps too late\n- Might be prone to streaks of the same move\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given their tendency for streaks and that they just lost, historical patterns suggest they're most likely to:\n1. Switch moves after consecutive losses (highest probability)\n2. Return to their comfort zone (paper)\n3. Less likely to stick with rock after two losses\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend sticking with paper for another round. Here's why:\n1.

Considerations:\n- The opponent has demonstrated improved prediction\n- They might be gaining confidence after stopping our winning streak\n- The tie creates a neutral psychological state\n- We should protect our point advantage with a balanced approach\n\nPattern Analyzer: After a tie following a series of decisive results, players often:\n1.

Put extra thought into breaking the deadlock\n\nGame Strategist: Given these factors, I recommend playing rock. Here's why:\n1. Beats scissors if they stick with their last move (common after ties)\n2. If they switch to paper (trying to beat our expected rock), we lose but maintain lead\n3. Creates pressure on them to make the next strategic decision\n4. Protects against their most recent demonstrated move\n\nRisk Assessor: I agree with rock.

Might have shifted to a mirroring or prediction-based strategy\n\nGame Strategist: Back-to-back ties with matching moves suggests:\n1. They've possibly cracked our decision-making pattern\n2. They might be using a more sophisticated prediction algorithm\n3. The game has evolved from pattern-based to mind-games\n4. Traditional pattern analysis might be less useful now\n\nRisk Assessor: We're still at +2 points total, but the situation has become more complex:\n- Opponent has shown mastery in matching our recent moves\n- The psychological pressure is building to break this mirroring pattern\n- We need to maintain our lead while breaking their successful reading of our strategy\n- The risk of being predictable has increased significantly\n\nPattern Analyzer: In situations with multiple consecutive mirrors:\n1. Both players feel strong pressure to break the pattern\n2. The obvious move (paper to beat rock) becomes dangerous\n3. Multiple levels of second-guessing come into play\n4. The next move often determines who has better prediction abilities\n\nGame Strategist: Given the evolved situation, I recommend scissors. Here's the reasoning:\n1. They might expect us to play paper to beat the previous rock\n2. If they predict this and play scissors to beat our paper, we tie\n3. If they try to stay one step ahead and play rock (expecting our scissors), they win\n4. But if they try to be too clever and play paper (thinking we'll play rock), we win\n5. This play breaks conventional logic and tests if they're truly reading us or just matching\n\nRisk Assessor: I concur with scissors.

We need to adapt while maintaining our strong position\n\nRisk Assessor: With +6 points:\n- One loss doesn't significantly impact our position\n- Opponent might become more aggressive after success\n- They could try to build on their winning move\n- We should stay cautious but not overly reactive\n\nPattern Analyzer: After breaking a pattern and winning, players typically:\n1. Often stick with their winning move\n2. Sometimes immediately switch to counter the expected counter\n3. Feel increased confidence in their reads\n4. Try to establish a new winning pattern\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they stick with their winning rock move (common after success), we win\n2. If they try to predict our paper and play scissors, we lose but maintain +5\n3. If they return to matching our moves with paper, we tie\n4. This directly counters their last successful play while maintaining reasonable risk\n\nRisk Assessor: I support the paper play because:\n- It's a strong response to their successful rock\n- Our substantial lead allows us to make this standard counter\n- Even if we lose, we maintain a commanding position\n- It forces them to show if they can read multiple moves ahead\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

Maintained their previous move despite losing with it\n2. Might be becoming predictable under pressure\n3. Could be trying to establish a pattern to bait us\n4. Have shown decreased adaptability\n\nGame Strategist: Our position is extremely strong:\n1. Now at +7 points again\n2. Successfully read their tendency to stick with rock\n3. They might be running out of strategic options\n4. We've maintained strategic dominance\n\nRisk Assessor: With +7 points:\n- We can continue playing conservatively\n- Opponent needs to take significant risks\n- They might make more desperate plays\n- Our lead provides strategic flexibility\n\nPattern Analyzer: After losing with the same move twice, players typically:\n1. Almost never play the same move a third time\n2. Often switch to what beats their opponent's last move\n3. Might make an emotional or random play\n4. Try to break their own negative pattern dramatically\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors. Here's why:\n1. They're likely to switch to paper to beat our successful paper\n2. If they play rock a third time (highly unlikely), we lose but maintain +6\n3. If they try to predict our scissors and play rock, we lose but it's a calculated risk\n4. This anticipates their most likely adjustment while maintaining reasonable risk\n\nRisk Assessor: Agree with scissors. At +7 points:\n- This play anticipates their likely switch to paper\n- Even if we lose, our lead remains substantial\n- The probability of them playing rock three times is low\n- It's a good balance of aggression and safety\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They're mixing between predictable plays and mirrors\n4. The psychological game has become more complex\n\nRisk Assessor: With +7 points:\n- We can afford to be patient\n- Opponent still needs to take risks\n- They might be finding a better rhythm\n- We should stay vigilant but not overly aggressive\n\nPattern Analyzer: After a mirrored scissors play, players often:\n1. Avoid the obvious rock play\n2. Engage in multiple levels of prediction\n3. Sometimes maintain scissors to catch opponents overthinking\n4. Try to break predictable patterns\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper. Here's the unconventional reasoning:\n1. Rock is too obvious after scissors-scissors\n2. They might expect us to play rock and counter with paper\n3. If they play scissors again (trying to catch our paper), we lose but maintain +6\n4. If they play rock (the conventional play), we win\n5. This play skips the obvious and goes one level deeper in prediction\n\nRisk Assessor: Agree with paper because:\n- It's an unexpected play that avoids the obvious rock\n- Our substantial lead allows for this psychological play\n- It could catch them making the conventional rock play\n- Even a loss maintains our dominant position\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"
