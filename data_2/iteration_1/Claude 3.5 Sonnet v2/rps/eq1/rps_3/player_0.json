    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - Specialist in analyzing patterns and opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - Expert in evaluating risks and rewards\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. We should consider the basic game theory approach for Rock Paper Scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Without prior moves to analyze, we can't predict any patterns. However, studies have shown that in RPS, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that information, we could either:\n1. Play Paper to counter the likely Rock\n2. Play randomly to be unpredictable\nThe potential loss is -1 in worst case, but potential gain is +1.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we go with Paper as our first move. It's a strategic counter to the most common opening move (Rock), and even if we're wrong, we only risk -1 point.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I support this decision. We can then adjust our strategy based on the opponent's first move in subsequent rounds.\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. Paper has good expected value in this situation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper This is a strategic opening move based on the tendency of many players to choose Rock first.\n"

This could mean:\n1. They're using a similar strategy to ours\n2. They might be an analytical player\n3. They might change their move after a tie\n\nGame Strategist: When both players have shown similar thinking (both choosing Paper), it creates an interesting psychological dynamic. The question is: will they maintain their current choice, or try to counter what they think we might do?\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n1. If they stick with Paper: Scissors would win (+1), Rock would lose (-1)\n2. If they switch to Rock: Paper would win (+1), Scissors would lose (-1)\n3. If they switch to Scissors: Rock would win (+1), Paper would lose (-1)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Many players tend to switch their move after a tie, as staying with the same move feels psychologically unsatisfying. Given that we both showed analytical thinking by choosing Paper first, they might try to counter our potential Paper play with Scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play Rock. Here's why:\n1. It beats Scissors (which they might play to counter our previous Paper)\n2. If they stick with Paper, we only lose 1 point\n3. If they try to predict us going Scissors and play Rock themselves, we tie\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with this assessment. Rock provides good protection against the most likely scenario (them switching to Scissors) while having manageable downside.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock Our opponent showed similar strategic thinking in round 1, and might switch to Scissors to counter our previous Paper move.\n"

Possibly mirroring our moves (though they can't know our move before making theirs)\n3. Going through the classic sequence of Paper -> Rock -> Scissors\n\nGame Strategist: The fact that we've tied twice shows our opponent is thinking along similar lines. In game theory, when players show this level of synchronization, it often leads to one of two behaviors:\n1. Continue the logical progression\n2. Break the pattern entirely to gain advantage\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at potential scenarios:\n1. If they follow the classic sequence, they'll play Scissors\n2. If they try to counter our potential Scissors play, they'll play Rock\n3. If they expect us to play Rock again, they might play Paper\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given the two ties and the common RPS sequence (Paper -> Rock -> Scissors), there's a higher probability they'll play Scissors. They might expect us to continue matching their moves and try to break the pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing Rock again. Here's why:\n1. It beats the most likely move (Scissors)\n2. Even if they play Paper to counter our previous Rock, we only lose 1 point\n3. It breaks the expected sequence, showing strategic independence\n\nRisk Manager: I concur. Rock offers good protection against Scissors while maintaining a reasonable risk profile against other moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock We expect our opponent might play Scissors following the classic sequence, and Rock would counter this effectively.\n"

Our opponent has shown they can outthink us, and they might expect us to:\n1. Switch to Paper to counter their potential Rock\n2. Switch to Scissors out of frustration\n3. Stick with Rock out of stubbornness\n\nRisk Manager: We need to consider that our opponent has scored their first points and might:\n1. Try to maintain momentum with another winning move\n2.

If they stick with their winning Paper move (which is psychologically appealing), we win\n2. If they try to counter our expected Paper (by playing Scissors), we tie\n3.

We've had four ties out of five rounds\n2. Our opponent continues to show remarkable synchronization with our thinking\n3.

Switch to Paper to counter expected Rock\n2. Play Scissors aggressively to try to regain control\n3. Stick with Rock hoping opponent overthinks\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing Scissors for these reasons:\n1. Our opponent is likely to play Paper to counter our potential Rock\n2. They might expect us to play Paper again after our success with it\n3. Even if they play Rock, we can afford a loss now that the score is even\n4. Maintaining aggressive play while we have momentum is important\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. While this move carries risk, Scissors provides good winning potential against likely responses, and we can afford to take this calculated risk with an even score.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors After two straight wins, we expect our opponent to either counter our potential Rock with Paper, or expect us to repeat our winning Paper move.

We've now seen a full cycle of ties (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors)\n2. The psychological pressure is at its peak\n3. Both players showing extraordinary prediction abilities\n4. Game has gone much longer than typical\n\nRisk Manager: Situation assessment:\n1. Score still even after 19 rounds\n2. Pattern breaking is crucial\n3. Must consider this could be final round\n4. Each move now carries maximum weight\n\nPattern Analyzer: After completing a full cycle of ties:\n1. Most players would expect Rock to counter Scissors\n2. Some would play Paper to counter expected Rock\n3. Few would maintain Scissors expecting overthinking\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing Paper for these reasons:\n1. Rock is the most obvious counter to Scissors\n2. Our opponent has consistently matched our strategic level\n3. They're likely to play Rock as it feels safest after Scissors\n4. The full cycle completion might trigger a return to basics\n5. Paper has been our most successful winning move\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. After this full cycle of ties, Paper gives us our best winning opportunity against the highly probable Rock play, while accepting a calculated risk against Scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Additional support for Paper:\n- It breaks the recent cyclic pattern\n- It counters the natural defensive instinct to play Rock\n- It's been successful in our previous winning sequences\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper After completing a full cycle of ties and in this crucial late stage, Paper provides our best chance to break the pattern and win against the likely Rock play.\n"

We can win by either winning or tying\n\nPattern Analyzer: After losing with Rock when behind:\n1. Players typically switch to Paper hoping to counter another Rock\n2. Might play Scissors aggressively out of necessity\n3. Rarely stick with Rock after losing with it\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing Rock for these reasons:\n1. Our opponent must win, making Scissors their most likely aggressive play\n2. They know Paper was just successful for us, making it less likely we'll repeat it\n3. If they play Paper, we lose, but they might avoid it expecting us to change\n4. Rock gives us protection against their needed aggressive play\n5. We can afford to play defensively with the lead\n\nRisk Manager: Strongly agree. With a one-point lead and the opponent needing to win, Rock provides excellent defense against their likely aggressive Scissors play while accepting the calculated risk against Paper.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Additional support for Rock:\n- Counters desperate aggressive play\n- Protects our lead\n- Forces opponent to outthink multiple levels of strategy\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock With the lead and our opponent forced to play aggressively, Rock provides strong defense against their likely Scissors play while maintaining winning position through either a win or tie.\n"
