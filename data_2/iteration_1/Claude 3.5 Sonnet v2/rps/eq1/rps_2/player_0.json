    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let's look at the recent pattern:\n- Just now: I won with rock vs their scissors\n- Before that: I won with scissors vs their paper\n- Before that: Tie with rock\n- Before that: Tie with paper\n\nCurrent score: 10 ties, 5 wins, 3 losses (+2 total)\n\nThis is my first back-to-back win sequence in the game. The last three moves have followed the classic cycle (paper -> scissors -> rock), but with me staying one step ahead. After losing twice in a row, they might:\n1. Break this cycle and play rock, expecting me to play scissors again\n2. Play paper to beat my potential rock (since rock just won for me)\n3. Play scissors expecting me to overthink and play paper\n\n[move] paper Since I've won twice in a row, they're likely to try to strongly counter my last winning move (rock) rather than try to predict a completely new pattern. Therefore, I'll play paper to beat their likely rock play.\n"
