    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Observations:\n   * Rock-Paper interaction has the highest stakes (3 points)\n   * Other interactions have lower stakes (1 point)\n   * Paper has potential for highest gain but also highest loss\n\n4. Strategic considerations for first move:\n   * Rock is relatively safe - can only lose 1 point if opponent plays scissors\n   * Paper can win 3 points but risk losing 3\n   * Scissors has balanced risk/reward\n\n5. For a first move against an unknown opponent, I'll choose rock:\n   * Limited downside (-1 if they choose scissors)\n   * Could win 1 point if they choose scissors\n   * Ties with rock\n   * Only vulnerable to paper\n\n[move] rock\n"

Critical observations:\n   * Double rock strategy failed again\n   * Consistency has been punished\n   * Inconsistency has been punished\n   * Opponent seems to read every strategic choice\n   * We're deep in negative points\n\n3. Risk analysis:\n   * Paper: Highest risk (-3), but desperate times...\n   * Rock: Just failed twice\n   * Scissors: Most balanced risk (-1 worst case)\n   * At -24 points, playing safe hasn't helped\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   * They just punished our consistency\n   * They might expect us to:\n     - Switch to paper to beat their scissors\n     - Try scissors as a safer option\n     - Stay with rock out of stubbornness\n\n5. Decision:\n   * Choose scissors because:\n     - They just used scissors, might not repeat\n     - If they try paper thinking we'll use rock, we win\n     - Has the most manageable risk profile (-1 worst case)\n     - Need to break our rock pattern\n     - Can't risk paper's -3 penalty this late\n     - Sometimes returning to basics is the best option\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Brutal reality:\n   * Only 1 win in 22 rounds\n   * Every strategy has failed\n   * Opponent predicts perfectly\n   * Both consistent and random approaches fail\n   * We're averaging more than -1 point per round\n\n3.

Tie pattern analysis:\n   * Sixth tie in the game\n   * Previous post-tie results:\n     - Nearly all switches after ties led to losses\n     - Staying with same move after tie also led to losses\n     - Opponent seems to read both stability and changes\n\n3.
