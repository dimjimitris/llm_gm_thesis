Pattern completion signals:\n   * Rock phase ended at 11 rounds\n   * Paper phase now at 11 rounds\n   * Historical precedent suggests change\n   * Pattern symmetry points to transition\n\n5. Risk evaluation:\n   * If pattern changes (highly likely):\n     - Expect scissors (following progression)\n     - Rock wins (+1)\n     - Paper loses (-1)\n   * If paper continues (unlikely):\n     - Rock loses (-3)\n     - But pattern symmetry argues against this\n\n6. Mathematical logic:\n   * Pattern lengths match exactly\n   * Previous transition was decisive\n   * Rock-Paper-Scissors progression suggests scissors next\n   * Timing matches historical behavior\n\n[move] rock With their paper pattern now matching their rock pattern at exactly 11 rounds, and following the logical Rock-Paper-Scissors progression, expecting a switch to scissors. Rock provides optimal coverage for this anticipated transition while accepting the calculated risk if paper continues.\n"

Extended pattern analysis:\n   * First phase: 11 rounds rock\n   * Current phase: 12 rounds paper (exceeded!)\n   * Total: +4 points\n   * Pattern length expectation broken\n\n2. Key observations:\n   * They've now exceeded their established pattern length\n   * Three consecutive successful rock plays by us\n   * They're maintaining paper despite losses\n   * Breaking from previous symmetry\n\n3. Strategic reassessment:\n   * Previous assumptions about:\n     - Pattern length (11 rounds) broken\n     - Transition timing incorrect\n     - But commitment to chosen move remains strong\n     - They're showing even stronger pattern dedication\n\n4. Psychological analysis:\n   * They're demonstrating:\n     - Enhanced pattern commitment\n     - Resistance to losses\n     - Possible testing of our adaptation\n     - Willingness to extend beyond expected limits\n\n5. Risk evaluation:\n   * If paper continues (likely given stronger commitment):\n     - Scissors wins (+1)\n     - Rock loses (-3)\n   * Pattern break seems less likely:\n     - They've shown increased pattern commitment\n     - They're accepting losses to maintain pattern\n     - They've exceeded expected duration\n\n6. Strategic conclusion:\n   * Their commitment is stronger than expected\n   * Pattern length prediction was wrong\n   * They're demonstrating enhanced persistence\n   * Need to respect demonstrated pattern\n\n[move] scissors Given they've exceeded their previous pattern length and shown even stronger commitment by maintaining paper despite losses, returning to scissors. Their enhanced pattern dedication suggests paper will continue, making scissors the optimal choice despite our recent success with rock.\n"
