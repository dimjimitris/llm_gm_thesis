Each of their moves has been different from their previous one, showing good adaptability and unpredictability.\n\n[move] scissors\n\nI chose scissors because:\n1. After winning with scissors, they might:\n   - Stick with scissors since it just worked (resulting in a tie)\n   - Switch to rock anticipating my paper counter (giving me a -1 point loss)\n   - Switch to paper expecting me to play rock (giving me a 1 point win)\n2. Scissors is strategic here because:\n   - It avoids the high-risk paper play (-3 potential loss)\n   - If they continue their pattern of changing moves, they're likely to switch from scissors\n   - The potential loss against rock (-1) is manageable\n   - Wins against paper if they try to counter my expected rock\n3. This maintains unpredictability while limiting potential losses\n"

The game continues to show how difficult it is to maintain consistent patterns or predict opponent behavior.\n\n[move] paper\n\nI chose paper because:\n1. After a scissors tie, common responses are:\n   - Stick with scissors (giving me a -1 point loss)\n   - Switch to rock to counter expected scissors (giving me a 3 point win)\n2. While this is a higher risk move (potential -3 against rock), I think it's justified because:\n   - After a tie, players often try to break the deadlock with a different move\n   - They've shown a preference for changing moves between rounds\n   - If they stick with scissors (which they've used multiple times), the loss is only -1\n   - The potential 3-point gain against rock makes this risk worthwhile\n3.

I'm specifically avoiding paper right now because:\n   - I've lost heavily with it multiple times\n   - The -3 point risk is too high given my opponent's demonstrated skill\n3. Scissors provides a balanced position:\n   - Wins against paper (+1)\n   - Only small loss against rock (-1)\n   - Possible tie against scissors\n4.
