    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or drawing against another move. In the first round, without prior information about the opponent's tendencies, any move is theoretically equally valid.\n\nPsychology Expert: Many players tend to choose Rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. However, since this is a rational AI opponent, they might anticipate this common tendency.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given that we have no prior information, we could either:\n1. Play paper to counter the common \"rock\" opening\n2. Play randomly to be unpredictable\n3. Play rock ourselves as a safe, common opening\n\nPsychology Expert: I suggest we go with paper as our opening move. It counters the common rock opening, and even if they don't play rock, we're not at any significant disadvantage.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While any move is theoretically equal in a single isolated round, paper has a psychological advantage as an opening move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Opening with paper as it's a strong strategic choice against common first-move tendencies.\n"

They might be using a similar strategic reasoning as us\n2. They might have a specific pattern they're following\n3. They could be attempting to establish a pattern to trap us\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often feel compelled to change their move, thinking the opponent will likely change theirs too. However, some might stick to their previous move hoping to catch others making this assumption.\n\nStrategic Planner: We have two main options here:\n1. Switch to scissors, anticipating they'll stick with paper\n2. Switch to rock, anticipating they'll switch to scissors\n3. Stay with paper, though this seems least advantageous\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they matched our paper move, they might be using similar logical reasoning. If they follow common game theory principles, they're more likely to switch than to stay with paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Most players won't play the same move three times in a row, and after a tie, there's a strong psychological impulse to change moves.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's go with scissors. It wins if they stick with paper, and if they switch to rock, we've only lost one point but gained valuable information about their strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After a paper-paper tie, switching to scissors as opponent is likely to either maintain paper or switch to rock.\n"

Using very similar strategic reasoning\n3. Deliberately mirroring to establish a pattern\n\nPsychology Expert: Two consecutive ties with identical moves is unlikely to be coincidence. The opponent might be:\n- Studying our pattern to predict our next move\n- Trying to establish a psychological connection\n- Planning to break the pattern at a crucial moment\n\nStrategic Planner: We have several options:\n1. Break the pattern completely with paper\n2. Continue the logical sequence (paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock)\n3. Stay with scissors to test if they're truly mirroring\n\nGame Theorist: If they're using an algorithm or similar logical reasoning, they might expect us to complete the cycle with rock. We should consider disrupting this expected pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: After two mirrors, there's strong psychological pressure to break the pattern. However, the opponent might anticipate this and plan accordingly.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's break the expected cycle by going back to paper. Here's why:\n- If they're mirroring us, they'll likely predict we'll choose rock and choose paper themselves\n- If they're trying to complete the cycle, they'll choose rock, which paper beats\n- If they're trying to break the pattern, they're most likely to choose scissors, which would be our only losing scenario\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

This suggests a sophisticated strategy rather than simple pattern-following. They might now:\n- Expect us to play scissors to counter their rock\n- Try another unexpected move\n- Return to mirroring to confuse us\n\nStrategic Planner: Our options are:\n1.

They'll likely expect us to play scissors to counter their previous rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's play rock.
