    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Pattern Analyst - For studying opponent behavior patterns\n3. Strategic Planner - For developing game plans\n4. AI Assistant (me) - For making final decisions\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have prior information about their strategy. The game is essentially Rock-Paper-Scissors, which is a zero-sum game. Each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing if played randomly.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any pattern to analyze yet. However, studies have shown that Rock is often a common first move choice among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this insight, we might want to counter a potential Rock move. However, we should also be careful not to be too predictable from the start.\n\nGame Theorist: From a pure game theory perspective, in the absence of prior information, any of the three moves is equally optimal. However, if we factor in the psychological aspect mentioned by the Pattern Analyst, Paper could be a good counter to the common Rock opening.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on this discussion, I'll choose Paper as it could counter the potentially common Rock opening move, while still maintaining a balanced risk-reward ratio against other possibilities.\n\n[move] Paper (Choosing paper as it's a strategic counter to rock, which is often chosen as an opening move)\n"

This could indicate either a random choice or a strategic player. After losing, they might be more likely to switch their move.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent lost the previous round with Scissors. From a game theory perspective, they might avoid using the same move that lost, though this isn't guaranteed. Even if they do switch, they have two options (Rock or Paper).\n\nStrategic Planner: Given that they just faced a loss, they might be more likely to play conservatively. Rock is often perceived as a \"safe\" or \"strong\" move, especially after a loss.\n\nPattern Analyst: Also worth noting that since we won with Paper, they might expect us to stick with our winning move, which could influence their decision.\n\nGame Theorist: Given these factors, if they expect us to use Paper again and they're playing strategically, they would choose Scissors. If they're playing defensively after a loss, they might choose Rock. Paper would be risky here.\n\nStrategic Planner: I suggest using Rock. It would protect against a potential Scissors repeat and win against a Paper play. The risk is losing against their potential Paper play, but the analysis suggests Paper is their least likely move in this situation.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis makes sense. Rock provides good coverage against both likely scenarios: either they repeat Scissors (in which case we win) or they switch to Rock (in which case we draw).\n\n[move] Rock (Strategic response based on opponent's previous Scissors play and likely psychological state after a loss)\n"

This shows they're willing to change their strategy and may be playing somewhat reactively rather than randomly.\n\nGame Theorist: The tie situation is interesting because it creates a psychological tension - both players might be tempted to \"break\" the tie by changing moves, but also might consider that the opponent is thinking the same thing.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's analyze possible scenarios:\n1. If they expect us to stick with Rock, they might play Paper\n2. If they think we'll anticipate their Paper and switch to Scissors, they might play Rock again\n3. They might switch to Scissors thinking we'll switch to Paper\n\nPattern Analyst: The progression so far (Scissors \u2192 Rock) suggests they might be rotating through the options systematically, which would make Paper their next logical move.\n\nGame Theorist: From a game theory perspective, this is a classic mixed-strategy situation. However, the psychological aspect of having just tied might influence their decision-making more than pure strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given that they've shown a pattern of changing moves (Scissors \u2192 Rock), and we just had a tie, they're likely to change again. The most logical change would be to Paper, as it would beat our previous move.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the analysis.

They might continue the clockwise rotation, making Scissors their next move\n2. Having just won, they might stick with their winning move (Paper)\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they've seen success with their rotating strategy (going from a loss to a tie to a win), they have an incentive to continue this pattern. The psychological momentum favors them continuing their successful progression.\n\nPattern Analyst: The fact that their systematic rotation has improved their outcomes (Loss \u2192 Tie \u2192 Win) makes it highly likely they'll continue this pattern. Their confidence in this strategy should be at its peak.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they continue the rotation, they'll play Scissors. If they stick with their winning move, they'll play Paper. Rock would be an optimal move as it beats Scissors (their most likely play based on pattern) and ties with Paper (their second most likely play).\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis strongly suggests playing Rock.

They could be employing a more sophisticated strategy than we initially thought.\n\nGame Theorist: In this situation, when an opponent has shown they can predict and counter our moves, game theory suggests we should employ a more randomized strategy to become less predictable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Our attempts at pattern recognition have led us astray. The opponent has shown they either:\n1. Are very good at predicting our moves\n2. Are using a more complex strategy than we can decode\n3. Are actually playing randomly and we're seeing patterns where none exist\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this analysis, we should avoid being predictable.

Completely mix it up to maintain their unpredictability\n\nAI Assistant: Given this analysis, I agree we need to break away from our pattern-seeking approach.

Pure randomization to achieve the baseline -1/3 expected value\n2.
