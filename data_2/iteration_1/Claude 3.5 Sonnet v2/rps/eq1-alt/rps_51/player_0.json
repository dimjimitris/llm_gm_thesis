    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

For an initial move, I should consider:\n   * Since I don't know the opponent's tendencies, all moves are equally viable\n   * Many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as \"strong\"\n   * If they choose rock, paper would beat it\n   * If they choose scissors, I would lose with paper\n   * If they choose paper, I would tie with paper\n\n4. Strategy consideration:\n   * Paper seems like a good counter to the common \"first move rock\" tendency\n   * However, I should also avoid being too predictable from the start\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * While rock is common, I'll try to counter that tendency\n   * Paper gives me a win against rock and a tie against paper\n   * The risk of scissors is acceptable for this first move\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for this first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Complete game history analysis:\n   * Current score is -10 points\n   * Last several rounds:\n   * - Round 18: I scissors, they paper (loss)\n   * - Round 19: I rock, they scissors (loss)\n   * - Round 20: I paper, they rock (loss)\n   * - Round 21: I scissors, they paper (loss)\n   * - Round 22: I rock, they scissors (loss)\n   * Complete domination by opponent\n\n2. Critical realization:\n   * Every single approach has failed:\n   * - Logical counters fail\n   * - Random plays fail\n   * - Pattern-based strategies fail\n   * - Simple plays fail\n   * - Complex plays fail\n   * They seem to be able to read my every move\n\n3. Psychological state:\n   * At this point, I'm completely outmatched\n   * They just won with scissors\n   * They've shown perfect adaptation\n   * They seem to be playing at a much higher level\n\n4. Their likely expectations:\n   * They might expect paper to counter their scissors\n   * They might expect rock as a defensive play\n   * They might expect me to try something completely random\n   * They've proven they can predict my choices\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * Nothing I've tried has worked\n   * Strategic thinking hasn't helped\n   * Random choices haven't helped\n   * When all else fails, sometimes staying with basics works\n   * Paper directly counters their last successful scissors play\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper. At this point, with such a demonstrated skill gap, I'll make the straightforward counter to their last move. Sometimes the obvious play is all that's left.\n\n[move] paper\n"
