    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

AI Assistant (me) - For making the final decision\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, when playing against a fresh opponent with no prior history, the Nash equilibrium for Rock-Paper-Scissors is to play each option with equal probability (1/3). This prevents exploitation by the opponent.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move and we have no data on the opponent's playing style, we can't identify any patterns yet. We should start with a neutral approach.\n\nRisk Manager: Each move has equal risk-reward potential in terms of points (+1/-1). No move is inherently riskier than others in this first round.\n\nGame Strategist: Given it's a fresh game, I suggest starting with 'rock'. Rock is often a common opening move by players due to its perceived \"strength\" in human psychology. However, knowing this, some players might anticipate this and play paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: We can use this first move to start gathering data about the opponent's strategy. Any move is equally valid for this purpose.\n\nAI Assistant: Thank you all for the input. Since this is a fresh game with no prior information, I'll go with a balanced choice that can help us gather information about the opponent's strategy.\n\n[move] paper This move is chosen as a strategic opening, understanding that any choice has equal mathematical probability of success against a fresh opponent.\n"

They might be following a similar strategic thinking\n2. They might switch to scissors next, expecting us to play paper again\n3. Or they might stick to paper, thinking we'll switch\n\nRisk Manager: The tie outcome was neutral for us (0 points). We need to consider if our opponent is likely to change their strategy after a tie.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that both players chose paper, there's a psychological tendency for players to either:\na) Switch to a different move to break the stalemate\nb) Stick to the same move, hoping the opponent will switch\n\nPattern Analyst: Based on common player psychology, after a tie, many players tend to switch their move to try to gain an advantage.\n\nRisk Manager: If we assume the opponent is likely to switch to scissors (to beat our previous paper), then rock would be our optimal counter-move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the Risk Manager. The most likely scenario is that our opponent will switch to scissors to counter our previous paper move. Playing rock would be a strong counter-strategy.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis makes sense. Given the psychological tendency to switch after a tie, and the likelihood of our opponent choosing scissors to beat our previous paper move, I'll make this decision:\n\n[move] rock Since we both played paper last round, this move anticipates our opponent switching to scissors to try to counter our previous paper play.\n"

This suggests either:\n1. Our opponent is using similar game theory principles\n2. There might be a systematic pattern in how both players are thinking\n\nRisk Manager: So far we've had two neutral outcomes (0 points each). Given the pattern of matching moves, we need to break this cycle to score points.\n\nPattern Analyst: If there's a progression pattern, after paper\u2192rock, the natural sequence would suggest scissors next. However, this could be too predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, we need to consider that:\n1. If the opponent is truly mirroring our moves (through similar strategic thinking), they might choose scissors\n2. If they're trying to break the pattern, they might choose paper to beat our expected rock\n3. If they're staying defensive, they might stick with rock\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, paper would be our safest bet as it:\n- Beats rock if they stay conservative\n- Ties with paper if they think like us\n- Only loses to scissors, which might be too obvious a choice\n\nAI Assistant: After considering all insights, I agree with the Risk Manager's analysis. Let's make this move:\n\n[move] paper This move aims to break the tie pattern while managing risk, as it beats rock (if opponent stays conservative) and avoids the most obvious pattern progression to scissors.\n"

We're both using very similar logical patterns\n3. The opponent might be using a fixed sequence that happens to match ours\n\nGame Strategist: Three consecutive ties with matching moves is extremely improbable by chance. We need to radically change our approach. Our current strategic thinking is too predictable or too aligned with our opponent's thinking.\n\nRisk Manager: We've scored 0 points across three rounds. While we haven't lost points, we're not making progress. We need to break this pattern decisively.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at the sequence (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), it's possible our opponent is:\n- Using an alternating pattern\n- Following game theory principles very similar to ours\n- Actually reacting to our moves (though this shouldn't be possible)\n\nGame Strategist: In this unusual situation, we should make a counter-intuitive move. Since both players have shown a tendency to be strategic and thoughtful (as evidenced by the matching moves), let's do something unexpected.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. The conservative approach has led to three ties. We need to break this pattern with a bold move.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis points to needing a pattern-breaking move. Instead of trying to out-think the opponent with complex strategy, let's make an unexpected choice:\n\n[move] scissors This move breaks our established pattern completely.

The more we try to be strategic, the more we seem to mirror our opponent.\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. Let's abandon all previous patterns and strategic thinking.

In traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n- Players make independent decisions\n- Information is private\n- Strategy matters\nBut when one of these pillars is removed (in this case, private information), the entire strategic foundation collapses into a pure mirroring exercise.\n\nRisk Manager: After eleven rounds with identical outcomes, we can appreciate how this exercise teaches through demonstration rather than explanation. It's far more powerful to experience firsthand how perfect information transforms a game than to simply read about it.\n\nPattern Analyst: The progression through eleven rounds has allowed us to:\n1. Test every possible strategic approach\n2. Verify the consistency of the mirroring\n3. Understand the underlying principle\n4.
