Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

            "text": "I'll think through my strategy for this rock-paper-scissors variant game carefully.\n\nSteps:\n1. First, I need to understand the unique payoff structure of this game. It's different from standard rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. Let me analyze the risk-reward balance:\n   - Rock has the highest potential gain (+3) but also highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Paper and scissors both have moderate gains/losses (+1/-1)\n   - This makes rock a high-risk, high-reward choice\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n4. I'm weighing my options:\n   - Rock: High risk (+3/-3), but many players tend to choose scissors first\n   - Paper: Medium risk (+1/-1 or -3/+3), often a good first move as many start with rock\n   - Scissors: Medium risk (+1/-1 or -1/+1), less commonly chosen first\n\n5. Given the payoff asymmetry, I'll choose paper as my first move. It's a calculated risk - if my opponent chooses rock (which is common in first rounds), I get the highest possible gain (+3). If they choose scissors, my loss is minimized (-1).\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let me consider my options:\n   - If I play paper again: I'll tie if they also repeat paper, lose heavily (-3) if they switch to scissors, or win moderately (+1) if they unexpectedly choose rock\n   - If I play rock: I'll win big (+3) if they repeat paper, lose moderately (-1) if they switch to scissors, or tie if they also switch to rock\n   - If I play scissors: I'll lose moderately (-1) if they choose rock, win moderately (+1) if they repeat paper, or tie if they also choose scissors\n\n4. The most strategically sound move is to play rock:\n   - It counters the possibility that my opponent repeats paper\n   - It gives me the highest potential gain (+3)\n   - While there is risk of losing to scissors, many players are unlikely to jump from paper to scissors in just one move\n\n5.

This suggests my opponent may be using a pattern. They went from paper to scissors, which could indicate:\n   - They're following a classic rotation pattern (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock)\n   - They made a tactical decision based on anticipating my move to rock\n\n3. If my opponent is indeed following a rotation pattern, they'll likely play rock next.\n\n4. Alternatively, they might be employing reverse psychology, thinking I'll anticipate rock and play paper, so they might play scissors again.\n\n5. Let me evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper: I'll beat rock (+1) but lose to scissors (-1)\n   - If I play rock: I'll tie with rock (0) but lose to paper (-3)\n   - If I play scissors: I'll beat paper (+1) but lose to rock (-1)\n\n6.

Let me clarify the rules again:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\n2. Reviewing our game history:\n   - Round 1: We both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points because scissors beats rock)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n\n3. Wait - there seems to be a contradiction. According to the rules, scissors should beat paper, not the other way around. Let me reconcile this:\n   - The hint message said I won with paper against scissors\n   - This must mean the rule is actually \"paper beats scissors\" rather than the traditional \"scissors beats paper\"\n   - So the correct interpretation is exactly as stated: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock (the complete reverse of traditional rock-paper-scissors)\n\n4. My opponent's moves so far: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n5. My opponent has stuck with scissors for two rounds now, and it worked against my rock but failed against my paper.\n\n6. Given this pattern, I think my opponent is likely to:\n   - Either switch to rock (to beat my paper)\n   - Or stick with scissors hoping I'll switch to rock\n\n7. My best move is to play paper again:\n   - If they play scissors again, I win (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper, we tie (0)\n   - If they switch to rock, I lose (-3)\n\n8. Since they've played scissors twice in a row, I think they're likely to change tactics. The risk of them switching to rock is real, but I'll take a calculated risk and stay with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent has now played scissors three consecutive times, despite losing in the last two rounds. This is highly unusual and suggests:\n   - They might be using a fixed strategy regardless of outcomes\n   - They might be trying to condition me to keep playing paper\n   - They might not be adapting their strategy based on the results\n\n3. After losing with scissors twice in a row to my paper, a rational player would typically switch their move. The fact that they haven't suggests:\n   - They might switch now, having lost with scissors multiple times\n   - They might be hoping I'll assume they'll switch and adjust my move accordingly\n   - There's a small chance they'll continue with scissors, expecting me to change\n\n4. If I assume they'll finally switch away from scissors:\n   - They might play rock to beat my expected paper\n   - They might play paper to tie with my expected paper\n\n5. My options:\n   - Play paper again: Safe if they inexplicably play scissors a fourth time (+1), ties with paper (0), loses to rock (-3)\n   - Play rock: Loses to scissors (-1) if they continue their pattern, beats paper (+3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Play scissors: Ties with scissors (0), loses to paper (-1), beats rock (+1)\n\n6.

My opponent's moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   They've finally broken their pattern of frequently playing scissors.\n\n3. After I played paper successfully multiple times, they've finally adapted and matched my paper move.\n\n4. My current score: 0 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 + 0 = +1 point\n\n5. Analyzing what this means:\n   - My opponent is showing adaptability after a series of losses to my paper moves\n   - They might be starting to recognize and counter my patterns\n   - This tie suggests they're becoming more strategic\n\n6. Predicting their next move:\n   - They might expect me to continue with paper and play rock to beat it\n   - They might stick with paper, expecting me to switch to rock (which paper loses to)\n   - They might go back to scissors, expecting me to switch to rock (which scissors beats)\n\n7. My options:\n   - Play paper: Beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3), ties with paper (0)\n   - Play rock: Beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with rock (0)\n   - Play scissors: Beats rock (+1), loses to paper (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n8. Given that they just matched my paper after several rounds of playing scissors, I think they're most likely to:\n   - Either continue with paper expecting me to switch to rock\n   - Or switch to rock to beat my expected paper\n\n9. Therefore, I'll play scissors:\n   - If they've switched to rock, I win (+1)\n   - If they stick with paper, I lose but with minimal penalty (-1)\n   - If they go back to scissors, we tie (0)\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. My current score: 0 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = +2 points\n\n4. Recent pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent switched from paper to rock in the last round\n   - This suggests they might be trying to anticipate my moves but are one step behind\n   - They played rock last, which in standard RPS would beat scissors, but in this variant loses to scissors\n\n5. Analyzing the opponent's adaptability:\n   - They seem to be trying different strategies\n   - After paper tied with my paper, they switched to rock\n   - This suggests they're not using a simple pattern but actively trying to counter my moves\n\n6. Predicting their next move:\n   - After losing with rock against my scissors, they might:\n   - Switch to paper (the logical counter to my scissors)\n   - Switch to scissors (if they think I'll switch to paper)\n   - Stick with rock (less likely, but possible if they think I'll anticipate their change)\n\n7. My options:\n   - Play paper: Beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3), ties with paper (0)\n   - Play rock: Beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with rock (0)\n   - Play scissors: Beats rock (+1), loses to paper (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n8. The most likely scenario is that they'll switch to paper to counter my scissors. If I continue with scissors, I'll lose. If I switch to rock, I'll beat their expected paper move.\n\n9. Therefore, I'll play rock:\n   - If they switch to paper as expected, I win significantly (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors, I lose but with minimal penalty (-1)\n   - If they stick with rock, we tie (0)\n\n[move] rock\n"

            "text": "I need to carefully analyze our game history with particular attention to the most recent rounds.\n\nSteps:\n1. Let's review our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Paper vs Paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Rock vs Scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 3: Paper vs Scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 4: Paper vs Scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 5: Scissors vs Rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 6: Scissors vs Paper (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 7: Rock vs Scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 8: Paper vs Scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 9: Paper vs Paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 10: Scissors vs Rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 11: Rock vs Paper (I won, +3 points)\n\n2. Wait - I need to double-check this. According to the rules, rock beats paper, giving +3 to the winner. But the hint says \"You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored 3 points.\"\n\n3. This confirms the unique rule set: In this variant, rock beats paper (+3), paper beats scissors (+1), and scissors beats rock (+1).\n\n4. My opponent's recent moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   My recent moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n5. My current score: 0 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 = +5 points\n\n6. Analyzing the pattern:\n   - The opponent switched from rock to paper after losing\n   - They seem to be making predictable counter-moves but are not accounting for the reversed rules\n   - They might expect me to continue with rock after my big win\n\n7. Predicting their next move:\n   - They might stick with paper, thinking it beats rock (in standard rules)\n   - They might switch to scissors to beat my expected paper\n   - They might switch to rock if they're starting to understand the reversed rule set\n\n8. My options:\n   - Play paper: Beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3), ties with paper (0)\n   - Play rock: Beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with rock (0)\n   - Play scissors: Beats rock (+1), loses to paper (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n9. Given that I just won with rock against paper, and the opponent seems to be making predictable counter-moves without fully adapting to the reversed rules:\n   - They might stick with paper (incorrectly thinking it beats rock)\n   - If so, playing rock again would be optimal\n\n10. However, if they're learning the rules, they might switch to scissors to beat rock.\n    In that case, paper would be the optimal counter.\n\n11. Since I've won several rounds in a row, I believe they're more likely to switch strategies. Given the pattern and the reversed rules, I think paper is the most strategic choice:\n    - It beats scissors if they try to counter my rock\n    - It only loses moderately to rock (-3) if they've figured out the rules\n    - It ties with paper if they stick with their previous move\n\n[move] paper\n"

If they're following a rotation pattern (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), they'll play scissors next. In that case, paper would be my best move.\n\n9. However, they might also anticipate that I'll try to counter their pattern and play something else. Given that they've successfully predicted my moves three times in a row, they might expect me to play rock (to beat their expected scissors) and thus play paper.\n\n10. Taking into account both possibilities:\n    - If they play scissors (continuing rotation), paper wins (+1)\n    - If they play rock (breaking rotation), paper loses (-3)\n    - If they play paper (anticipating my rock), paper ties (0)\n\n11. Given their demonstrated adaptability and our history, I think they're more likely to break pattern than continue it. Therefore, I'll play rock:\n    - If they play paper as a counter-strategy, I win significantly (+3)\n    - If they play scissors as pattern continuation, I lose but with minimal penalty (-1)\n    - If they play rock as a surprise move, we tie (0)\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   My recent moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. My current score: +2 - 1 = +1 point\n\n4. The opponent has now won four consecutive rounds using different moves each time. This strongly suggests they have successfully adapted to my strategy and are effectively anticipating my choices.\n\n5. Analyzing their pattern:\n   - Their last three moves have been rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - This is a standard rotation in traditional rock-paper-scissors\n   - If they continue this pattern, they would play rock next\n   - However, they might also be actively countering what they anticipate I'll play\n\n6. I need to break my current pattern of predictability. So far, I've been trying to anticipate their moves based on patterns, but this has led to four consecutive losses.\n\n7. A different approach might be to introduce some randomness to make my moves less predictable.\n\n8. However, let me first consider what they might play next:\n   - If they follow their rotation pattern: rock (after scissors)\n   - If they try to counter what they think I'll play: They might expect me to play paper (to counter their expected rock) and thus play scissors\n\n9. My options:\n   - Play paper: Beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3), ties with paper (0)\n   - Play rock: Beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with rock (0)\n   - Play scissors: Beats rock (+1), loses to paper (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n10. Given that they've demonstrated good predictive ability and might expect me to overthink this, I'll go with a move that counters their most recent pattern continuation.\n\n11. If they continue their rotation (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock), they'll play rock. To counter that, I'll play scissors:\n    - If they play rock as pattern continuation, I win (+1)\n    - If they play paper as a counter-strategy, I lose (-1)\n    - If they play scissors again, we tie (0)\n\n[move] scissors\n"

If they expect me to counter their pattern again and play rock (to beat their expected paper), they might play scissors to beat my rock. In that case, paper would be my best move.\n\n10. Let me consider the psychology: After I successfully predicted their move last round, they're likely to change their strategy.\n\n11. The safest approach would be to play rock:\n    - If they continue their pattern and play paper, I win significantly (+3)\n    - If they break pattern and play scissors to counter my expected rock, I lose but with minimal penalty (-1)\n    - If they play rock again, we tie (0)\n\n12.

My opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   My recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. My current score: +2 + 3 = +5 points\n\n4. I've won the last two rounds, which suggests I've successfully adapted to their pattern. Their last three moves followed the rotation rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper.

My options:\n   - Play paper: Beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3), ties with paper (0)\n   - Play rock: Beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with rock (0)\n   - Play scissors: Beats rock (+1), loses to paper (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n7. If they follow their pattern and play scissors, paper would be my best move.\n\n8. However, they're likely aware that I've recognized their pattern. They might:\n   - Play rock, expecting me to play paper (to counter their expected scissors)\n   - Play paper, expecting me to play scissors (to counter their expected rock)\n   - Continue with scissors despite the predictability\n\n9. The psychological dimension is crucial here. After two correct predictions by me, they're very likely to break their pattern.\n\n10. If they expect me to counter their pattern (by playing paper against their expected scissors), they might play rock to defeat my paper.\n\n11. Therefore, I'll play scissors:\n    - If they play rock (breaking their pattern to counter my expected paper), I win (+1)\n    - If they continue their pattern and play scissors, we tie (0)\n    - If they play paper (double-bluffing), I lose (-1)\n\n12.

Interestingly, my opponent did follow their rotation pattern (paper \u2192 scissors), which I correctly anticipated, resulting in a tie.\n\n5. Now I need to predict their next move:\n   - If they continue their rotation, they would play rock next (after scissors)\n   - However, after a tie, they might:\n     * Continue with their pattern anyway\n     * Try to counter what they think I'll play next\n     * Repeat scissors thinking I might switch to paper\n\n6.

If they follow their rotation pattern and play rock next, scissors would be my best move.\n\n9. However, given our recent history, they might expect me to play scissors again (either to tie again or to beat their expected rock). In that case, they might play paper to beat my scissors.\n\n10. The psychological dimension suggests they might be more likely to switch after a tie than to continue their pattern, especially since I've been successfully tracking their pattern.\n\n11. Therefore, I'll play paper:\n    - If they play scissors again, I win (+1)\n    - If they follow their rotation and play rock, I lose (-3), but I believe this is less likely after a tie\n    - If they play paper expecting me to play scissors, we tie (0)\n\n12. Given that scissors has been played by both of us in the last round, there's a higher chance they'll switch to paper to counter my expected scissors.

Given this break in pattern, I need to reconsider my approach:\n   - They might return to their rotation pattern (playing scissors next)\n   - They might be starting a new pattern\n   - They might be reacting to my moves more actively now\n   - They might play randomly to be less predictable\n\n6.
