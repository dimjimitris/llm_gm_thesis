The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This extreme bias suggests they might be following a fixed strategy or algorithm rather than adapting to the game outcomes.\n\nGiven this overwhelming and consistent pattern:\n\n[move] paper\n\nI'm continuing with paper because:\n1) Their preference for scissors has reached an even higher percentage\n2) They've now played scissors seven consecutive times\n3) Paper beats scissors in this variant, consistently earning me points\n4) The pattern has become so strong that deviating from my counter-strategy would be irrational\n5) Even if they finally change their move, the expected value of playing paper is still higher than any alternative\n\nWhile there's always the possibility they might suddenly change their strategy after this long streak of scissors, the evidence overwhelmingly supports continuing with paper. I'll maintain this counter-strategy until I see clear evidence of adaptation from my opponent.\n"
