This suggests my opponent might be actively trying to counter my moves or is one step ahead in terms of game theory.\n\n6. Given the sequence of my opponent's moves, they haven't repeated the same move in consecutive rounds.\n\n7. After playing scissors, they've historically gone to paper (round 3) and might do so again.\n\n8. If they play paper, I should play rock to win 3 points.\n\n9. However, there's also a chance they'll play rock (not repeating scissors and avoiding the pattern of going to paper).\n\n10. Let me consider all options:\n    - If they play rock and I play scissors, I win 1 point\n    - If they play paper and I play scissors, I lose 1 point\n    - If they play scissors and I play scissors, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n11. Given that scissors has the most balanced risk-reward profile against the possible moves, and considering they might expect me to play rock after losing to scissors, I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Also, my opponent has now played paper twice in a row, breaking their earlier pattern of not repeating moves.\n\n5.

But in the last round, I played rock and my opponent played paper, and I won 3 points. This suggests the rules might actually be:\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n\n4. However, these seem to be the same! The confusion might stem from my misreading earlier results.\n\n5.

The consistent pattern is:\n   - Rock beats Paper (+3/-3)\n   - Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n\n7. This is different from traditional rock-paper-scissors but matches the rules stated initially.\n\n8. My opponent's last move was paper, and they've now played paper 5 times, scissors 4 times, and rock 4 times.\n\n9. After paper, historically they've played:\n   - Rock (1 time)\n   - Scissors (2 times)\n   - Paper again (1 time)\n   - With a slight preference for scissors.\n\n10. If they play scissors, I should play paper to win 1 point.\n    If they play rock, I should play scissors to win 1 point.\n    If they play paper again, I should play rock to win 3 points.\n\n11.

Updated move distribution: paper (5 times), scissors (5 times), rock (5 times)\n   They now have a perfectly balanced distribution across all three options.\n\n4. After rock, they've historically played:\n   - Scissors (2 times)\n   - Paper (2 times)\n   - Rock again (1 time)\n\n5. Given they just played rock, their most likely next moves based on historical pattern are scissors or paper.\n\n6. Let me review what I've learned about the winning combinations:\n   - Rock seems to beat paper (Round 13)\n   - Paper seems to beat scissors (Round 14)\n   - Scissors seems to beat rock (Rounds 4, 6, 8, 12)\n\n7. If they play scissors, I should play paper.\n   If they play paper, I should play rock.\n   If they play rock again, it would be another tie.\n\n8. Since they're slightly more likely to play scissors after rock based on their pattern, and paper beats scissors (as observed in round 14), I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This is now the second consecutive round where I've played paper, they've played scissors, and I've won 1 point. This confirms:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 points)\n\n3. My opponent's complete sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n4. Updated move distribution: paper (5 times), scissors (6 times), rock (5 times)\n   They now show a slight preference for scissors.\n\n5. Interestingly, they've now played scissors twice in a row (rounds 15-16), which they've only done once before (rounds 7-8).\n\n6. After scissors, they've historically played:\n   - Paper (2 times)\n   - Rock (1 time)\n   - Scissors again (2 times, including this last pair)\n\n7. Given they've just played scissors twice in a row, and historically after such a pattern they've switched to another move, they're likely to play either paper or rock next.\n\n8. Based on the winning combinations I've confirmed:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n\n9. If they play paper, I should play rock to win 3 points.\n   If they play rock, I should play scissors to win 1 point.\n   If they play scissors again, I should play paper to win 1 point.\n\n10. Since they've played scissors twice in a row and are likely to change, and paper has been their most frequent choice after consecutive scissors, I'll play rock which would win 3 points against paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's complete sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. Updated move distribution: paper (7 times), scissors (9 times), rock (7 times)\n   They continue to show a preference for scissors, with rock and paper tied.\n\n4. After rock, they've historically played:\n   - Scissors (2 times)\n   - Paper (3 times)\n   - Rock again (2 times)\n   With a slight preference for paper after rock.\n\n5. Since they just played rock, based on historical patterns, their most likely next move is paper.\n\n6. If they play paper, I should play rock to win 3 points.\n   If they play scissors, I should play paper to win 1 point.\n   If they play rock again, it would be another tie.\n\n7. Since paper is their most likely move (played after rock 3 out of 7 times), and rock beats paper, I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
