    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Their last move was rock, which beat my scissors.\n\nAt this point, I need to completely change my approach. Instead of trying to predict their next move based on patterns or trying to counter their last move, I'm going to focus on the simplest strategy - what would beat their last move directly?\n\nSince they played rock last, paper would be the direct counter. While they might expect this and play scissors, continuing with reactive strategies clearly isn't working. By playing paper, I'm making the most straightforward counter to their last move while hoping to break this losing streak. I'm also accepting that they might be using a more sophisticated algorithm to predict my choices.\n"

My opponent seems to be perfectly predicting my every move. Their last move was scissors, which beat my paper.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to try rock, which directly counters their last move (scissors). While they've consistently stayed one step ahead of me, I need to continue playing the game with strategic choices.\n\nIt's possible they're using a sophisticated algorithm, have identified a pattern in my play that I'm not seeing, or potentially have information about my moves before I make them. Regardless, rock is my choice for this round as it would win against scissors if they were to repeat their last move, while breaking any pattern they might have detected in my strategy.\n"

This is the first non-loss after seven consecutive defeats.\n\nThis tie suggests several possibilities:\n1) My opponent's prediction pattern may have shifted\n2) They might have anticipated I would play rock but decided to play rock themselves\n3) There might be some randomness in their strategy that resulted in this match\n\nSince we both played rock last time, I'll play paper now. This is a standard progression in rock-paper-scissors strategy - after a tie, players often shift to what would beat the previous move. If my opponent follows the same logic, they might play paper too (resulting in another tie). If they try to counter my expected paper, they would play scissors. However, they might also stick with rock if they believe I'll play scissors expecting them to play paper.\n\nGiven our history, paper seems like the most strategic choice at this point.\n"

This choice has several strategic considerations:\n\n1) It directly counters their last move (scissors) if they were to repeat it\n2) If they're using a pattern where they play what would beat my last move, they'd play rock (to beat my paper), in which case my scissors would lose\n3) If they're using reverse psychology expecting me to counter their scissors with rock, they might play paper, in which case my scissors would win\n\nGiven that conventional strategies haven't worked well against this opponent, I'm choosing scissors as a calculated risk that might disrupt whatever algorithm or pattern they're using to predict my moves.\n"

This is counter-intuitive in rock-paper-scissors, but:\n\n1) If they're using a pattern where they expect me to counter their last move, they might expect me to play paper (to beat their rock), so they would play scissors, resulting in a tie\n2) If they're using a more complex algorithm that has identified patterns in my decision-making, repeating the same move might confuse it\n3) If they have foreknowledge of my moves, this strategy won't help, but conventional strategies haven't worked either\n\nPlaying scissors again is a strategic attempt to break whatever prediction method they're using.\n"
