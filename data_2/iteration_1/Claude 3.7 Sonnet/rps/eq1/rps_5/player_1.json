Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In Rock-Paper-Scissors, no single move is inherently better than others in a one-shot game.\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n3. Without prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal expected value.\n4. Some research suggests that in first-time plays, rock is slightly more common as an opening move for many players.\n5. Given this slight tendency, choosing paper might give a small edge.\n6. However, if the opponent is strategically sophisticated, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n7. Since I don't have enough information to make a prediction with high confidence, I'll make a choice that has equal expected value.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as my move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

We've now tied five times total, with scissors-scissors ties in the last two rounds.\n5. This is highly unusual - most players would break the pattern after a single tie.\n6. The fact that my opponent played scissors again after our first scissors tie suggests they're either:\n   a) Trying to establish a pattern to trick me\n   b) Using reverse psychology, expecting me to switch while they stay\n   c) Simply being unpredictable\n\n7. After two consecutive scissors ties, there's an even stronger psychological pressure to change.\n8. The most natural progression would be to play rock after scissors.\n9. My opponent likely anticipates I'll finally switch to rock after two scissors ties.\n10. If they expect me to play rock, they would likely counter with paper.\n11. To beat their expected paper, I should play scissors again.\n12. However, they might anticipate this third-level thinking and play rock.\n\n13.

There's no consistent pattern in how my opponent plays after rock-rock ties.\n9. The natural progression from rock is paper.\n10. Given the series of three consecutive ties, there's tremendous psychological pressure to break the pattern.\n11. My opponent has shown strategic sophistication throughout the game.\n12. They might expect me to play paper (the natural progression from rock), and counter with scissors.\n13. Alternatively, they might play paper themselves, following the natural progression.\n\n14. Given the strong pressure to break the tie pattern and my opponent's strategic thinking, I believe they're most likely to play scissors, anticipating my paper.\n15. To counter their expected scissors, I should play rock again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We've now tied 10 times in total, with two consecutive rock-rock ties.\n5. This situation is highly unusual - four consecutive ties with repeated rocks.\n6. After two consecutive rock-rock ties, my opponent might:\n   a) Finally play paper as the natural progression from rock\n   b) Expect me to finally switch to paper and counter with scissors\n   c) Play rock a third time, creating an even more unusual pattern\n\n7. The psychological pressure to break this tie streak is now extremely strong.\n8. My opponent has shown they're willing to maintain unusual patterns (like our previous scissors-scissors ties).\n9.

The pressure to break this tie streak is now overwhelming.\n9. If my opponent is intentionally matching my moves, they must be watching my pattern closely.\n10. To break this pattern, I need to make a move that breaks predictable progressions.\n\n11. Given the pattern we've established, the expected move after paper would be scissors.\n12.

Given the game mechanics, option (b) seems unlikely unless there's a technical issue.\n9. For option (a), my opponent might be recognizing patterns in my decision-making.\n\n10.
