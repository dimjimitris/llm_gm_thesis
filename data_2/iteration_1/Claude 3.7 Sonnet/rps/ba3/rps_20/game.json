Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have data on their tendencies.\n\n4. Given the asymmetric payoffs, paper has the highest potential reward (+3), making it tempting.\n\n5. However, many players might choose rock in the first round as it's a common first choice.\n\n6. But sophisticated players might anticipate this and choose paper to counter the expected rock.\n\n7. The optimal strategy in the long run would be to randomize, but with a slight adjustment based on the asymmetric payoffs.\n\n8. For this first move, I'll choose paper because:\n   - If my opponent plays rock (a common opening move), I get +3 points\n   - If my opponent plays scissors, I lose only 1 point\n   - If my opponent plays paper, it's a tie with no loss\n\n[move] paper\n"

This confirms they've been following a perfect rock-paper-scissors cycle the entire game.\n\n5. Based on this pattern, they should play rock next.\n\n6. However, I need to be cautious. If they realize I've identified their pattern, they might break it.\n\n7. Looking at my own moves:\n   paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   \n   My moves have been somewhat predictable too, with repetitions of paper-rock pairs and then scissors.\n\n8. If my opponent maintains their perfect cycle, they will play rock next.\n\n9. To counter rock, I should play paper.\n\n10. The risk is that they might anticipate this and break their pattern by playing scissors.\n\n11. Given their strict adherence to the pattern so far (even when it resulted in ties), I believe there's a high probability they'll continue with rock.\n\n12. Playing paper gives me the best potential reward (+3) if they continue their pattern.\n\n13. Even though it's risky (potential -1 if they break pattern with scissors), I'll play paper to counter their expected rock move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

However, they might anticipate this and play rock instead.\n\n9. Given that they've been following their reverse cycle consistently for the last few rounds, there's a good chance they'll play paper next.\n\n10. I'll play scissors:\n    - If they play paper (continuing their reverse cycle), I win +1\n    - If they play rock (breaking their cycle), I lose 1 point\n    - If they play scissors, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n11. This is a calculated decision based on their recent pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
