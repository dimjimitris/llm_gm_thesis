Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the expected value of each move:\n   - Rock: Win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3), tie against rock (0)\n   - Paper: Win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against paper (0)\n   - Scissors: Win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n\n4. Paper has the highest potential payoff (+3) with a relatively small penalty if I lose (-1).\n\n5.

Now I need to consider whether my opponent:\n   - Randomly chose scissors\n   - Has a preference for scissors\n   - Is strategically anticipating my moves\n\n3. A common strategy in rock-paper-scissors is to play the move that would beat what your opponent just played, assuming they might repeat their move.\n\n4. Since my opponent played scissors last round, they might:\n   - Play scissors again if they have a preference for it\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I might play rock to counter their scissors\n   - Switch to paper to counter the rock they think I might play\n\n5. If they play scissors again, my best response is rock (+1 points)\n   - If they play rock, my rock would tie (0 points)\n   - If they play paper, my rock would lose (-3 points)\n\n6.

In the second round: I played rock, opponent played rock, resulting in a tie (0 points).\n\n3. This shows my opponent has shifted from scissors to rock, potentially:\n   - Anticipating my counter-move\n   - Using a rotation strategy (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper?)\n   - Adapting to my previous moves\n\n4. If they're following a rotation pattern, they may play paper next. \n\n5. If they're countering what beat them previously, they wouldn't have information since the last round was a tie.\n\n6. One common behavior is to play what would have beaten your opponent's last move. Since I played rock last time, they might anticipate I'll play paper and thus choose scissors.\n\n7. Weighing my options:\n   - If I play rock and they play paper, I lose 3 points\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock, I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper, I win 1 point\n\n8. Based on the potential rotation pattern and the risk/reward balance, scissors seems like the best option. It counters the paper they might play next in a rotation pattern, and limits my loss if I'm wrong.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Interesting - my opponent seems to be consistently playing scissors when I play paper.

If they play rock as predicted by their rotation pattern, rock would result in a tie (0 points), but scissors would lose (-1 point), and paper would win (+3 points).\n\n8.

My opponent has maintained their perfect \"scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\" rotation through twenty-one consecutive rounds without any deviation.\n\n3. Following this established pattern, they should play scissors next.\n\n4. The optimal counter to scissors is rock.\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If I play rock and they play paper, I lose 3 points\n\n6. Given their perfect adherence to this rotation pattern through twenty-one rounds, I have essentially 100% confidence they will play scissors next.\n\n7.
