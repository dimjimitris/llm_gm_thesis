First, I need to understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie (0 points)\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3. Let me analyze the expected value of each move:\n   - For rock: I win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3), tie against rock (0)\n   - For paper: I win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against paper (0)\n   - For scissors: I win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n\n4. Without knowledge of opponent tendencies, the highest potential reward comes from paper (+3 if opponent plays rock), but it also risks a small loss (-1 if opponent plays scissors).\n\n5. Rock is more balanced but has the worst potential loss (-3 if opponent plays paper).\n\n6. Scissors has the lowest potential gain (+1) but also minimizes potential loss (-1).\n\n7. Since paper has the highest potential reward and a manageable risk, I'll choose paper for this opening move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let me think about the psychology:\n   - Players often change their move after losing\n   - They might anticipate that I'll repeat my winning move\n   - They might also be wary of the big -3 penalty from playing rock against paper again\n\n4. Analyzing the expected values based on the opponent's likely next move:\n   - If I expect them to play scissors (to counter my previous paper), I should play rock\n   - If I expect them to play rock again (less likely), I should play paper again\n   - If I expect them to play paper (to counter my potential rock), I should play scissors\n\n5. Since my opponent lost with rock and faced a significant -3 penalty, they're likely to change their move. Scissors would be a logical choice for them to counter my previous paper move.\n\n6.

Analyzing my opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their last 5 moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They've successfully countered my last two moves\n   - After playing scissors repeatedly, they've shown more adaptability recently\n\n3. Consider the opponent's psychology:\n   - They just had a big win with paper (+3 points)\n   - They might be feeling confident in their ability to predict my moves\n   - They're demonstrating increasing strategic awareness\n\n4. Opponent's possible thinking:\n   - \"I just beat rock with paper for a big gain\"\n   - \"My opponent might play scissors to counter my paper\"\n   - \"Or they might play paper expecting me to switch back to scissors\"\n\n5. After suffering a -3 point loss, I need to be especially careful about being predictable.\n\n6. Possible scenarios:\n   - If they stick with paper (continuing what worked): scissors would be best (+1)\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my scissors or paper): rock would be best (+1)\n   - If they play rock (mixing it up): paper would be best (+3)\n\n7. Given their recent adaptability and big win with paper, I think they're most likely to:\n   - Either stick with paper since it worked well\n   - Or play scissors expecting me to counter their paper\n\n8. Since they've shown increasing ability to predict my moves, I need to break their expectation pattern.\n\n9. Scissors would counter their paper if they repeat it, and would tie if they anticipate this move and also play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Consider the opponent's psychology:\n   - They just won with scissors against my paper\n   - Scissors has been their most successful move\n   - They might be reinforced to continue using scissors\n\n4. My performance analysis:\n   - I've won most consistently when playing rock against their scissors (3 times)\n   - I've lost 3 times when playing paper against scissors\n   - Overall pattern suggests scissors is their default move\n\n5. Given their overwhelming preference for scissors:\n   - Rock would be my most logical move\n   - They might expect me to play rock and counter with paper\n   - However, their history shows a consistent return to scissors even when predictable\n\n6. Weighing all factors:\n   - Their strong bias toward scissors (8/13 rounds)\n   - Their success with scissors against my paper (3 times)\n   - My success with rock against their scissors (3 times)\n   - The limited evidence they maintain counter-strategies for multiple rounds\n\n7.

Analyzing my opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their last 5 moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They've played rock in the last two rounds\n   - We just tied with both playing rock\n\n3. Consider the opponent's psychology:\n   - After a tie, players often change moves\n   - They might expect me to change from rock\n   - They've shown adaptability throughout the game\n\n4. Opponent's possible thinking:\n   - \"We just tied with rock\"\n   - \"My opponent might play paper to beat my rock\"\n   - \"I should play scissors to counter their paper\"\n\n5. My strategic considerations:\n   - If they play scissors (countering my expected paper): rock would be best (+1)\n   - If they play rock again (less likely after a tie): paper would be best (+3)\n   - If they play paper (countering my expected rock): scissors would be best (+1)\n\n6. Pattern analysis:\n   - After previous ties, they've typically changed their move\n   - They've played rock twice in a row, which is relatively unusual for them\n   - Throughout the game, they've shown an ability to anticipate counter-moves\n\n7. Given the psychological tendency to switch after ties, and their demonstrated ability to anticipate counter-moves, they're most likely to play scissors this round, expecting me to play paper to counter their rock.\n\n8. Therefore, rock would be my optimal move to counter their likely scissors play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - They've shown they adapt after losses\n   - Rock has been successful for me against them multiple times\n   - They likely recognize the pattern of my rock success\n\n7.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
