Given this uncertainty, I'll make a balanced first move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for my first move, as it's a reasonable starting choice that will beat rock if the opponent makes that common first selection.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let me update my analysis with the latest round:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 2: Both played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 7: Both played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 9: Both played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n\n2. This latest result contradicts my understanding of the rules. Let me reassess:\n   - Round 3: Rock vs Paper, I won (suggests rock beats paper)\n   - Round 5: Paper vs Scissors, I won (suggests paper beats scissors)\n   - Round 6: Scissors vs Rock, I won (suggests scissors beats rock)\n   - But Round 11: Rock vs Scissors, I lost (contradicts the pattern)\n\n3. Let me review all win/loss outcomes:\n   - Round 1: Paper vs Rock, I lost (paper loses to rock)\n   - Round 3: Rock vs Paper, I won (rock beats paper)\n   - Round 4: Scissors vs Paper, I lost (scissors loses to paper)\n   - Round 5: Paper vs Scissors, I won (paper beats scissors)\n   - Round 6: Scissors vs Rock, I won (scissors beats rock)\n   - Round 8: Paper vs Rock, I lost (paper loses to rock)\n   - Round 10: Scissors vs Paper, I lost (scissors loses to paper)\n   - Round 11: Rock vs Scissors, I lost (rock loses to scissors)\n\n4. The results are inconsistent or I misunderstood something. Let me reconsider the game's behavior:\n   - The results in rounds 1, 4, 8, and 10 suggest: paper loses to rock, scissors lose to paper\n   - The results in rounds 3, 5, and 6 suggest: rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, scissors beat rock\n   - But round 11 contradicts this: rock loses to scissors\n\n5. My current score is now: -1 + 0 + 1 + (-1) + 1 + 1 + 0 + (-1) + 0 + (-1) + (-1) = -2 points\n\n6. Given the confusion about rules, I'll focus on my opponent's pattern:\n   - Recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They seem to be alternating between paper and scissors lately\n\n7. If they continue alternating, they might play paper next.\n\n8. If they play paper, I should play rock (assuming rock beats paper) or scissors (if scissors beats paper).\n\n9. Given the mixed results, I'll make a choice that seems to have worked previously.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, which appeared to beat paper in round 3.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let me update my analysis with the latest round:\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n\n2. My current score is now: -3 + (-1) = -4 points\n\n3. This is the fourth time I've played rock against scissors and lost (rounds 11, 16, 17, and 20).\n\n4. Let me reconsider the rules by listing all win/loss outcomes systematically:\n   - I win when: \n     * Rock beats Paper (rounds 3, 12)\n     * Paper beats Scissors (round 5)\n     * Scissors beats Rock (round 6)\n   - I lose when:\n     * Paper loses to Rock (rounds 1, 8)\n     * Scissors loses to Paper (rounds 4, 10)\n     * Rock loses to Scissors (rounds 11, 16, 17, 20)\n\n5. These results suggest a consistent (though reversed from traditional) ruleset:\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n\n6. My opponent seems highly effective at anticipating my moves, resulting in either ties or wins for them.\n\n7. Their recent sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They've stuck with scissors twice now, and it's been effective against my rock\n\n8. Since scissors has been consistently beating my rock, they might:\n   a) Play scissors again (continuing what works)\n   b) Anticipate I'll switch to paper and play rock\n   c) Anticipate I'll switch to scissors and play paper\n\n9. Given their success with scissors, they might stick with it, expecting me to play rock again or switch to paper.\n\n10. To counter scissors, based on my win in round 5, I should play paper.\n\n11. However, if they anticipate this and switch to rock, I would lose.\n\n12. Given the pattern of the game and their apparent ability to predict my moves, I need to make a less predictable choice.\n\n13. Looking at the full history, scissors has been my most successful move (winning once, losing twice, tying three times).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, based on my win against scissors in round 5 and to break this losing pattern.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
