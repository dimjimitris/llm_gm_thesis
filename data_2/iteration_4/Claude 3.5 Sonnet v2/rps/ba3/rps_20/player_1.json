    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Observations about the payoffs:\n   * Paper has the highest potential gain (+3)\n   * Rock and scissors only offer +1 gain\n   * Paper also risks the highest loss (-3)\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * Without knowing opponent tendencies, playing paper is high-risk/high-reward\n   * Rock and scissors have more balanced risk/reward\n   * Many players tend to choose rock as first move in RPS games\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * Given these factors, I'll choose paper\n   * If opponent plays rock (common first move), I get maximum points (+3)\n   * If opponent plays scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   * Risk seems worth potential reward\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analysis of last round:\n   * I won by playing paper against rock\n   * This earned me 3 points\n   * The opponent showed a tendency to play rock\n\n2.

Analyzing potential opponent adjustments:\n   * If they expect paper from me, they'll likely play scissors\n   * If they're stubborn, they might stick with rock\n   * Least likely they'll play paper after just losing to it\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   * Playing paper again is risky - likely to be countered\n   * Playing rock is safe but might be wasted if they switch to paper\n   * Playing scissors would beat expected paper and counter potential anti-paper strategy\n\n5.

            "text": "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Game history analysis:\n   * Last 5 relevant rounds:\n     * Round 20: Rock vs Scissors (won +1)\n     * Round 21: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n     * Round 22: Scissors vs Rock (lost -1)\n     * Round 23: Rock vs Scissors (won +1)\n   * Score now at +4\n   * Rock has been consistently successful\n\n2. Pattern observations:\n   * Opponent has played scissors twice in last three moves\n   * They seem to be struggling with consistent strategy\n   * Rock has won for me multiple times\n   * Game showing alternating patterns rather than streaks\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * Strong +4 lead gives strategic flexibility\n   * Opponent might be frustrated after another loss\n   * They likely expect me to either:\n     * Stick with winning rock\n     * Or switch to paper expecting their rock counter\n   * They need to make bigger gains to catch up\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * Rock has been reliable but might be too predictable now\n   * Opponent needs to make aggressive moves to catch up\n   * They might take bigger risks now\n   * Need to protect substantial lead\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * I'll play paper\n   * This protects against their most likely comeback move (rock)\n   * If they play scissors in desperation, I only lose 1 and still have +3 lead\n   * This continues my pattern of unpredictability\n   * With +4 lead, can afford to risk -1 for potential +3 gain\n   * This move anticipates their need to make a strong counter\n\n[move] paper\n"
