    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

We should consider a balanced approach that minimizes potential losses while maintaining reasonable winning potential.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the expected values:\n- Paper: Can win 1, lose 3, or tie 0\n- Rock: Can win 3, lose 1, or tie 0\n- Scissors: Can win 1, lose 3, or tie 0\nRock has the highest potential gain with moderate risk.\n\nGame Strategist: For an opening move, I recommend rock. Here's why:\n1. It has the highest potential gain (3 points)\n2. If we lose with rock, we only lose 1 point\n3. Against a fresh player, they might choose a \"safe\" option like paper\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with the rock strategy. The worst-case scenario is only -1 points, while the best case is +3 points. This is a good risk-reward ratio for an opening move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock I choose rock as it offers the best risk-reward ratio with high potential gain (3 points) and limited downside (-1 point).\n"

Try rock themselves to get the highest potential gain\n\nData Analyst: In the last round:\n- They played paper (lost)\n- We played rock (won)\nAfter a loss, players often change their strategy. Given they lost 3 points, they might be more risk-averse now.\n\nRisk Manager: We need to consider that they might:\n1. Avoid paper since it lost\n2. Try to predict our next move based on our winning rock play\nMost players would expect us to either:\n- Stick with rock after it worked\n- Switch to paper expecting them to play rock\n\nGame Strategist: Given these considerations, I recommend scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they play rock (trying to get the big win), we only lose 1 point\n2. If they play paper again (being stubborn), we win 1 point\n3. If they play scissors (trying to beat our potential paper play), we tie\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with scissors. The maximum loss is limited to 1 point, and it counters paper if they repeat their move. It's a balanced choice that protects against their potential strategies.\n\nData Analyst: The expected value of scissors looks good here, considering the psychological factors and typical player behaviors after a significant loss.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After analyzing the opponent's likely responses to their previous loss, scissors provides a balanced approach with limited downside risk while countering several likely opponent strategies.\n"

If they continue this pattern, they might play rock next.\n\nData Analyst: Let's analyze their behavior:\n1. They started conservative with paper\n2. After losing big, they switched to scissors\n3. After a tie, they're in a neutral position\nHistorical pattern suggests players often stick to a rotation pattern once they start it, especially after a tie that neither rewards nor punishes their previous choice.\n\nRisk Manager: We need to consider two main possibilities:\n1. They continue the clockwise rotation to rock\n2. They break the pattern, expecting us to predict it\nThe payoff structure is important here:\n- If we play paper and they play rock: We win 1 point\n- If we play paper and they play scissors: We lose 3 points\n- If we play paper and they play paper: We tie\n\nGame Strategist: Despite the temptation to play paper to counter their potential rock move, I recommend playing rock instead.

However, they've now had two consecutive ties.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the tie sequence:\n1. First tie with scissors\n2. Second tie with rock\nPlayers often break away from ties, as they typically want to score points. After multiple ties, there's a strong psychological impulse to \"break the stalemate.\"\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has shown they:\n1. Avoid repeating losing moves (haven't played paper since losing with it)\n2. Are comfortable playing for ties (two in a row)\n3. May be getting frustrated with the lack of scoring\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing scissors here. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they're frustrated with ties and try to win big with paper, we win 1 point\n2. If they play rock again, we only lose 1 point\n3. If they play scissors, we tie (but less likely after two ties)\n\nRisk Manager: I disagree. Let's play paper instead:\n1. If they're frustrated and go for the big win with rock, we win 1 point\n2. If they play scissors trying to counter our potential rock, we lose 1 point\n3. After two ties, they're less likely to play another tie move\n\nData Analyst: I support the paper play. The opponent has shown a tendency to move through the cycle, and after rock, paper would be next. Plus, with two ties, they're likely looking to score points, making rock (which would give them the biggest potential win) an attractive option for them.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper After two consecutive ties, playing paper positions us well to counter an aggressive play for points while maintaining a manageable downside risk.\n"

The opponent might be playing defensively, mirroring our moves\n2. They might be using some form of prediction algorithm\n3. The sequence of ties is statistically unlikely by chance\nKey observation: They seem to be either predicting our moves very well or somehow knowing them.\n\nRisk Manager: This is a critical moment:\n1.

This is the 6th rock-rock tie\n2. Their last three moves: Scissors\u2192Rock\u2192Rock\n3. Rock ties are becoming extremely frequent\n4. They return to rock after losses or uncertain situations\n\nRisk Manager: Strategic considerations:\n1. Very late in the game\n2. They're still significantly behind\n3. They need to make winning moves\n4. Conservative play (rock) isn't helping them catch up\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors. Here's why:\n1. After yet another rock tie:\n   - They might finally break away from rock\n   - They're likely to play paper to beat our expected rock\n   - They need winning moves, not more ties\n2. The endgame pressure should force them to be more aggressive\n3. They can't afford more ties if they want to catch up\n\nData Analyst: Supporting analysis:\n- Rock ties have become too predictable\n- They haven't won with rock in the entire game\n- Time pressure should force a strategy change\n- Paper would be their logical choice to beat our expected rock\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with scissors:\n1. If they play paper (trying to beat rock): We win 1 point\n2. If they play rock again: We lose only 1 point\n3. If they play scissors: We tie\n4. The risk-reward ratio is favorable given the game situation\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Playing scissors as they need to break away from rock to score points, making paper their likely choice to counter our expected rock play in this late-game situation.\n"

After winning with paper:\n   - They might get overconfident and play paper again\n   - They might expect us to play paper to counter their paper\n   - They could try scissors expecting us to play paper\n2.

They might expect us to play paper after so many rock ties\n2. They're desperate enough to play paper for a big win\n3. Scissors gives us:\n   - Win against paper (1 point)\n   - Tie against scissors\n   - Loss against rock (-1 point)\n\nRisk Manager: I support scissors because:\n1. Lower maximum loss (-1 vs -3)\n2. They're likely to play paper hoping for a 3-point win\n3. They can't afford more ties\n4. Time pressure often leads to aggressive plays\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed.
