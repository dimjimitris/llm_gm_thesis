    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

For a first move against an unknown opponent:\n   - Better to play conservatively\n   - Avoid the high-risk Paper option\n   - Choose between Rock or Scissors\n\n5. Between Rock and Scissors:\n   - Rock can only lose small (-1 to Scissors)\n   - Rock can win small (+1 against Scissors)\n   - Rock seems slightly safer as a first move\n\n[move] rock I choose to play conservatively with rock for my first move, avoiding the high-risk paper option while maintaining potential for both defense and offense.\n"

            "text": "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Last few moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They just lost with rock\n   - Changed from scissors after losses\n   - Rock was an attempt to break pattern\n   - Each change has failed\n\n2. Psychological state:\n   - Multiple consecutive losses\n   - Each strategy change has backfired\n   - Tried returning to scissors (failed)\n   - Tried rock (failed)\n   - Growing frustration evident\n\n3. Behavior under pressure:\n   - They've tried scissors (failed)\n   - Tried rock (failed)\n   - Paper hasn't been used recently\n   - Need something different\n   - Might see paper as \"fresh\" option\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   - If they try paper: scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they return to scissors: rock wins (+1)\n   - If they repeat rock: paper wins (+3)\n   - Need to consider their desperation\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Both scissors and rock just failed them\n   - Paper hasn't been used in several rounds\n   - They need a new strategy\n   - Paper might seem like their only option\n   - They're likely avoiding recent failing moves\n\n[move] scissors I choose scissors because after failing with both scissors and rock, they're most likely to try paper, which they haven't used recently. Scissors beats paper and only risks a small loss against rock, which just failed them.\n"

Psychological assessment:\n   - Finally found success with paper\n   - Broke out of losing pattern\n   - Might feel paper strategy validated\n   - But know we'll likely adjust\n   - Confidence might be returning\n\n3. Historical patterns after wins:\n   - When finding success with new strategy:\n   - Sometimes stick with winning move\n   - Sometimes anticipate counter and switch\n   - Paper just worked well\n   - But they know we'll adapt\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   - If they repeat paper (confidence): scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they expect scissors counter: rock wins (+1)\n   - If they return to scissors: rock wins (+1)\n   - Rock gives most balanced position\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - After success with paper, they'll either:\n   - Stick with working strategy (paper)\n   - Or expect our scissors counter and use rock\n   - Less likely to return to scissors\n   - Need to cover most likely scenarios\n\n[move] rock I choose rock because after winning with paper, they're likely to either expect our scissors counter and use rock, or return to their historical scissors comfort zone. Rock wins in both these scenarios and only risks a small loss (-3) against another paper play, which is riskier for them to repeat.\n"
