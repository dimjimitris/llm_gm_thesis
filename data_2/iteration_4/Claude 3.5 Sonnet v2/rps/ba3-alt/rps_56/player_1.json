    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

For a first move with no prior information:\n   * Playing Paper is high-risk, high-reward\n   * Rock or Scissors are safer options\n   * Rock has advantage over Scissors and only loses badly to Paper\n\n5.

Recent game history:\n   * Round 18: paper vs paper (tie)\n   * Round 19: rock vs rock (tie)\n   * Round 20: scissors vs rock (win +1)\n   * Round 21: rock vs paper (win +3)\n   * Their sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   * My sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   * I've won two consecutive rounds\n\n2. Critical observations:\n   * I just won big again (+3)\n   * They've returned to paper despite previous losses\n   * My recent wins have been significant\n   * They seem to be struggling with their strategy\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   * They've lost twice in a row now\n   * The last loss was a significant -3\n   * They might be playing more emotionally than strategically\n   * They need to break my winning streak\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   * After a big loss, they're likely to:\n     - Play scissors to counter expected paper\n     - Play rock as a safe defensive move\n     - Try to break any pattern I might be establishing\n   * They need to stop their losing streak\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * I'll choose scissors\n   * Reasoning:\n     - After multiple losses, especially a big one, they might stick with paper hoping to catch me overthinking\n     - If they play paper expecting me to switch away from rock, scissors wins (+1)\n     - If they play rock defensively, I only lose -1\n     - Breaking my own rock pattern before it becomes predictable\n     - Shows I'm not getting predictable despite success\n     - Their recent emotional plays suggest they might stick with paper out of frustration\n     - Even if wrong, minimizes potential loss while maintaining aggressive strategy\n\n[move] scissors\n"
