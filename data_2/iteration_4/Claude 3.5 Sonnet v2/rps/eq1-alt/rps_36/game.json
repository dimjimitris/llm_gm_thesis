Keep scissors expecting another tie or thinking I'll switch to paper\n2. Switch to rock to beat the scissors if they think I'll stick with it\n3. Switch to paper thinking I might use rock to counter potential scissors\n\nThe opponent has shown improved adaptability in recent rounds, breaking out of their previous predictable patterns. After ties, players often try to gain an advantage by predicting their opponent's change in strategy.\n\n[move] rock Since they've become more strategic and just tied with scissors, they might stick with scissors thinking I'll switch to paper, or use paper thinking I'll use scissors again. Rock beats scissors and ties with rock if they try to counter my expected scissors play.\n"
