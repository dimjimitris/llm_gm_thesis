In such cases, it's best to start with a balanced approach. Rock-Paper-Scissors is a zero-sum game where no single move dominates others.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without any historical data, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying. There's no statistical advantage to any particular move in the first round.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Many players tend to choose Rock as their first move as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable\". However, since this is an AI opponent, psychological patterns might not apply in the same way.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these insights, I suggest we start with Paper. If opponents tend to choose Rock first, Paper would win, and if not, we can adjust our strategy based on the outcome.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Agreed. Paper gives us a good chance against a potential Rock-first player, while maintaining equal odds against other moves.\n\nFinal collaboration reached.\n\n[move] Paper - Starting with a balanced option that could counter the common \"Rock-first\" tendency while maintaining equal chances against other moves.\n"

Since scissors lost last time, they might switch to either rock (to beat our potential paper) or paper (completely changing their approach).\n\nGame Strategist: Given these considerations, I suggest we play rock. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with scissors (which just lost), we win\n2. If they switch to paper (a complete strategy change), we win\n3. If they switch to rock (to counter our previous paper), we tie\n\nStatistical Analyst: The suggested rock move provides good coverage against the most likely scenarios based on common player patterns.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Agreed.

They might be testing if we'll continue with paper\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they return to their scissors strategy (treating this as a one-time break), we tie\n2. If they stick with rock (starting a new pattern), we win\n3. If they switch to paper (trying to be unpredictable), we lose\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given their demonstrated preference for sticking with moves for multiple rounds, rock is more likely than an immediate switch to paper.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Agreed. They've shown a strong tendency to maintain moves rather than frequently switching. After successfully breaking our adaptation, they might stick with rock for a while.\n\nFinal collaboration reached.\n\n[move] Scissors - Anticipating either a return to their scissors strategy or a continued rock play based on their pattern of move persistence\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.
