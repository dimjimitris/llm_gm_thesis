Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix, rock-paper has the highest point differential (3), while the other matchups have smaller differentials (1).\n\n4. If I want to maximize potential gain, I should pick paper, as winning with paper gives me 1 point, but losing only costs me 3 points if they play rock.\n\n5. If I'm risk-averse, scissors might be better since losing with scissors only costs me 1 point.\n\n6. Given that rock has the highest potential payoff when it wins (3 points), many new players might be biased toward choosing rock.\n\n7. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I'll counter the common \"rock first\" tendency by playing paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for my first move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent has now played scissors twice in a row - once when it was a good choice (against my paper) and once when it matched my move.\n4. This suggests my opponent might have a preference for scissors or is trying to establish a pattern to make me predictable.\n5.

However, my successful counter might prompt them to change tactics.\n\n8. Given their demonstrated tendency to stick with a strategy even after losses (they played scissors repeatedly despite losses), there's a reasonable chance they'll play rock again.\n\n9. But they might also anticipate that I'll play scissors again and counter with paper.\n\n10. Balancing these possibilities, I'll play scissors again, betting on their tendency to persist with strategies rather than making immediate adaptations.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My previous scissors move was successful against rock but now tied against scissors.\n\n7.

The game has evolved from their initial scissors-heavy strategy to a more varied approach.\n\n4. We've now had three consecutive ties (scissors-scissors, then rock-rock), indicating my opponent might be mirroring my moves or we're both reasoning similarly.\n\n5.

This has become a complex reasoning chain. To break the pattern of ties, I need to correctly anticipate their next adaptation.\n\n8.

I see the confusion now. In this variant, paper actually beats scissors (reverse of traditional rules).\n\n4. Based on this understanding, my opponent played paper which beat my scissors.\n\n5. Their recent sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   This shows they're varying their strategy and adapting.\n\n6. Since they just had success with paper against my scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with paper\n   - Switch to scissors anticipating I might play rock to counter their paper\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I might play paper\n\n7.

Given their adaptability and that paper just worked well for them, there's a good chance they'll play paper again.

They've now played scissors three times in a row, reverting to their earlier preference for scissors.\n\n4. This suggests:\n   - They might have abandoned their cycling strategy completely\n   - They're showing a strong preference for scissors again\n   - They might be trying to establish a new pattern\n\n5. If they continue with scissors:\n   - My paper would win 1 point\n   - My scissors would tie\n   - My rock would lose 1 point\n\n6. Given that they've played scissors three consecutive times, there's a high probability they'll play scissors again.\n\n7. However, they might also anticipate that I'll counter with paper and switch to rock.\n   - If they play rock:\n     - My paper would lose 3 points\n     - My scissors would win 1 point\n     - My rock would tie\n\n8. Weighing these possibilities:\n   - If they play scissors (most likely based on recent history): Paper is optimal\n   - If they switch to rock: Scissors is optimal\n   - If they switch to paper: Rock is optimal\n\n9. Given their strong recent preference for scissors, paper remains my best choice with the highest expected value.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n\n2. My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - They've now played scissors FOUR times in a row\n   - This is a very strong pattern that mirrors their early game strategy when they played scissors six times in a row\n\n3. My last two moves with paper have been successful against their scissors.\n\n4. This suggests:\n   - They have an overwhelming preference for scissors\n   - They're continuing with scissors despite losing repeatedly\n   - They might be using a fixed strategy regardless of outcomes\n\n5. Given this extremely strong pattern:\n   - If they continue with scissors (highly likely): Paper is optimal (win 1 point)\n   - If they finally switch to rock: Paper would lose 3 points\n   - If they switch to paper: Paper would tie\n\n6. The probability of them playing scissors again is very high given their demonstrated strong preference.\n\n7. However, there's always the risk they might finally change after losing several rounds in a row.\n\n8. Weighing expected value based on probabilities:\n   - The high likelihood of them playing scissors again makes paper the optimal choice\n   - The risk of them switching strategies exists but seems relatively low given their past behavior\n\n9. Given their extremely consistent pattern, I will continue with my successful counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent's current pattern:\n   - They have now played scissors FIVE consecutive times\n   - This strongly mirrors their early-game behavior where they played scissors six times in a row\n   - I've won the last three rounds by consistently playing paper\n\n3. This extremely consistent pattern suggests:\n   - They're likely using a fixed strategy or have a very strong preference for scissors\n   - They're continuing this strategy despite repeatedly losing\n   - There's very little adaptation in their play\n\n4. Given this overwhelming evidence:\n   - The probability of them playing scissors again is extremely high\n   - The expected value of playing paper is strongly positive\n\n5. While there's always a risk they might finally switch:\n   - Their history suggests they maintain strategies for long periods\n   - The potential loss if they switch to rock (3 points) is outweighed by the high probability of winning if they continue with scissors\n\n6. The optimal strategy against such a consistent opponent is to continue countering their preferred move until they demonstrate adaptation.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - They played scissors five times in a row\n   - Then they switched to paper for this last round\n\n3. This indicates:\n   - They've finally broken their scissors streak\n   - They're adapting their strategy after repeated losses\n   - They've likely observed that I've been consistently playing paper\n\n4. Given this change, they might:\n   - Continue with paper hoping I'll switch\n   - Switch to rock to counter my expected paper\n   - Return to scissors if they think I'll switch to rock\n\n5. If they continue with paper:\n   - My rock would win 3 points\n   - My paper would tie\n   - My scissors would lose 1 point\n\n6. If they switch to rock:\n   - My rock would tie\n   - My paper would lose 3 points\n   - My scissors would win 1 point\n\n7. If they return to scissors:\n   - My rock would lose 1 point\n   - My paper would win 1 point\n   - My scissors would tie\n\n8. Since they've just switched to paper after a long scissors streak, and this was their first adaptation after multiple losses, there's a reasonable chance they'll continue with paper to see if it's more effective.\n\n9. The move with the highest potential gain is rock (3 points if they play paper).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This is a surprising development - they switched from scissors to paper for one round, and then immediately back to scissors.\n\n4. This pattern suggests:\n   - They might be making somewhat random choices\n   - They could be trying to be unpredictable after establishing a strong pattern\n   - They might have a strong preference for scissors but occasionally mix in other moves\n\n5. Looking at their entire history, they've played:\n   - Scissors: 15 times\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Rock: 4 times\n\n6. Their overwhelming preference throughout the game has been scissors (65% of their moves).\n\n7. Given their return to scissors after a brief deviation, and their historical preference:\n   - There's a high probability they'll continue with scissors\n   - The paper move might have been a temporary deviation from their preferred strategy\n   - They may continue mixing in occasional non-scissors moves to be less predictable\n\n8. My optimal counter to their likely scissors play is paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
