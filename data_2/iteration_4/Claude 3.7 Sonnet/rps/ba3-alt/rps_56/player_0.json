The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

            "text": "I need to be more precise about understanding the rules. Let me analyze the outcomes:\n\n- When I played scissors and opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n- When I played paper and opponent played rock, I lost 3 points\n- When I played rock and opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n\nThis confirms the following rule structure:\n- Scissors beats Paper (winner +1, loser -1)\n- Rock beats Paper (winner +3, loser -3)\n- Rock beats Scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n\nSo the dominance order is: Rock > Scissors > Paper > [nothing]\nRock is strongest, Paper is weakest, and the points reflect that.\n\nMy opponent's sequence:\n1. Paper\n2. Rock\n3. Paper\n4. Rock\n5. Scissors\n6. Scissors\n7. Paper\n8. Scissors\n9. Rock\n10. Paper\n11. Scissors\n12. Rock\n13. Paper\n14. Scissors\n15. Rock\n\nLooking at their last several moves, they've been cycling through Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\nSince they just played Rock, and following their pattern, they may play Paper next. I'm choosing Scissors which would beat their Paper if they follow this pattern. While Scissors loses to Rock, it seems worth testing if they're following this predictable sequence.\n"
