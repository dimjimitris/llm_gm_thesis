You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

They changed strategy after losing 5 consecutive rounds\n\nThis suggests they are capable of adaptation, though they seem to require multiple losses before changing strategy. Now I need to predict their next move:\n\n- They might continue with paper since it just worked\n- They might anticipate my counter to paper (which would be rock) and switch to scissors\n- They might return to their favored rock strategy\n\nGiven their demonstrated tendency to stick with successful strategies for extended periods (scissors early, then rock), there's a good chance they'll continue with paper for at least another round.\n\nTo counter paper, I'll play rock:\n\n[move] rock\n"
