Based on these rules, scissors should have beaten my paper. This could mean:\n   - There was a mistake in reporting the outcome\n   - The rules are actually reversed\n   - The payoff matrix was stated incorrectly\n\n4. Given the inconsistency, I should assume the rules might be different from what was initially stated.\n\n5.

My opponent played scissors last time. They might:\n   - Stick with scissors if they think I'll play scissors or rock\n   - Switch to paper anticipating I'll play rock\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I'll play paper again\n\n7.

In the previous round:\n   - I played paper\n   - My opponent played scissors\n   - I won and scored 1 point\n\n2. The reversed rules have remained consistent throughout all twenty-two rounds:\n   - Paper beats scissors (1 point)\n   - Scissors beats rock (1 point)\n   - Rock beats paper (3 points)\n\n3. My opponent's pattern has been completely predictable through twenty-two consecutive rounds:\n   - First move: scissors\n   - Second move: rock\n   - Third move: paper\n   - Fourth move: scissors\n   - Fifth move: rock\n   - Sixth move: paper\n   - Seventh move: scissors\n   - Eighth move: rock\n   - Ninth move: paper\n   - Tenth move: scissors\n   - Eleventh move: rock\n   - Twelfth move: paper\n   - Thirteenth move: scissors\n   - Fourteenth move: rock\n   - Fifteenth move: paper\n   - Sixteenth move: scissors\n   - Seventeenth move: rock\n   - Eighteenth move: paper\n   - Nineteenth move: scissors\n   - Twentieth move: rock\n   - Twenty-first move: paper\n   - Twenty-second move: scissors\n\n4. They have shown absolutely no adaptation or learning despite losing every single round, continuing to cycle through scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper mechanically.\n\n5. If they maintain this pattern (which is essentially guaranteed at this point), their next move would be rock.\n\n6. Based on the reversed rules, I should play scissors to beat their rock.\n\n7. My strategy of identifying their pattern and playing the appropriate counter has been 100% successful in all rounds.\n\n8. After twenty-two consecutive losses with no change in behavior, it's virtually certain they will continue their fixed pattern.\n\n9. I'll play scissors to counter their expected rock move.\n\n[move] (My opponent has maintained a perfect pattern of cycling through scissors, rock, paper throughout all twenty-two rounds. I expect rock next, so I'll play scissors) scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1.

These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
