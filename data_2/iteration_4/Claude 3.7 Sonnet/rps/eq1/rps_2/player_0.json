    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's update the analysis:\n\n- Round 11: Rock vs Scissors (I won)\n- Round 12: Scissors vs Paper (I won)\n- Round 13: Paper vs Rock (I won)\n\nTheir complete move sequence:\nPaper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\nMy opponent has maintained their pattern throughout all 13 rounds. If they continue this sequence, their next move would be Scissors.\n\nThere are two possibilities:\n1) They continue with their established pattern and play Scissors\n2) They realize I've identified their pattern (as evidenced by my 3 consecutive wins) and change their strategy\n\nSince I've now won three rounds in a row by anticipating their moves correctly, there's an increased chance they'll break their pattern. However, without evidence of them changing, I should continue to counter their pattern.\n\nBased on their pattern, I expect them to play Scissors next, so I'll choose Rock to counter it.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
