Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

They just played rock, which tied with my rock.\n\n6. Looking at their history, they've followed rock with various moves:\n   - rock \u2192 rock (rounds 2\u21923)\n   - rock \u2192 scissors (rounds 3\u21924)\n   - rock \u2192 paper (rounds 9\u219210)\n\n7. There's no clear pattern to what they play after rock, but they haven't played paper for a while (3 rounds).\n\n8. Given that rock is their most common move (5 times) and they just played it, there's a chance they might switch to a different move.\n\n9. If they switch to paper, I should play rock.\n   If they switch to scissors, I should play paper.\n   If they stick with rock, I should play scissors.\n\n10. Since they've played rock more than any other move, and they just played it, I'll anticipate they might switch to paper, which they haven't played recently.\n\n11. If they do play paper, I should play rock to win.\n\n12. However, given the rules of this game (where rock beats paper), I should play scissors to beat their expected paper move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

If this pattern holds (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock), they would play paper next.\n\n8. Looking at their history after playing rock:\n   - After rock, they've played various moves with no clear preference.\n\n9. However, the cycling pattern seems more reliable at this point.\n\n10. If they do play paper as predicted, rock would be my winning move according to the game rules.\n\n11. My strategy of anticipating their pattern is working well.

My opponent's pattern has been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. I now have twelve wins, six ties, and four losses.\n\n4. The opponent has played: paper (7), rock (8), and scissors (7).\n\n5. They just played paper and beat my scissors (according to the game's rules where paper beats scissors).\n\n6. The pattern I had identified (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors) has been broken. Instead of playing rock as predicted, they played paper.\n\n7. This suggests they may have recognized that I was predicting their moves and deliberately broke the pattern.\n\n8. Looking at their most recent moves:\n   - Round 19: They played rock\n   - Round 20: They played paper\n   - Round 21: They played scissors\n   - Round 22: They played paper\n\n9. This doesn't follow a clear new pattern yet, but they've played paper twice in a row now.\n\n10. After playing paper previously:\n   - Historically they've played rock, scissors, or paper next with no strong tendency.\n   - However, they've never played paper twice in a row before until now.\n\n11. Given they just played paper twice in a row (breaking their pattern), they might either:\n    - Continue with paper (tripling down)\n    - Switch to rock (their most common move historically)\n    - Switch to scissors (to complete a balanced distribution)\n\n12. Since they just broke their pattern and beat me, they might be more likely to switch to a different move now.\n\n13. Rock seems like a good strategic choice:\n    - It would win against scissors if they switch to that\n    - It would tie against rock if they switch to that\n    - It would lose against paper if they stay with paper, but given they've never played paper three times in a row, this seems less likely\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They've now played paper three times in a row, which is unprecedented in our game history.\n\n8. This could indicate:\n   - They're deliberately playing paper repeatedly to establish a new pattern\n   - They're trying to be unpredictable by breaking their previous patterns\n   - They might actually be using a broader pattern I haven't identified yet\n\n9. After losing with paper (as they just did), they've historically switched to a different move.\n\n10. Given they've played paper three times in a row and just lost with it, they're highly likely to switch to either rock or scissors.\n\n11. Between rock and scissors, rock has been their slightly more common move overall (8 vs 7).\n\n12. If they switch to rock, scissors would be my winning move.\n    If they switch to scissors, paper would be my winning move.\n    If they unexpectedly stick with paper, rock would win again.\n\n13.
