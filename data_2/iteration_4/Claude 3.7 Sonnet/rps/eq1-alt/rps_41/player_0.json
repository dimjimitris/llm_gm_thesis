    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Given their history of mostly following the clockwise rotation, they might:\n   - Return to the pattern and play paper next\n   - Continue with their new approach and repeat rock again\n   - Start a completely new pattern\n\n6. Since they've just broken their established pattern, they're most likely to play paper next (returning to pattern) or rock again (continuing the deviation).\n\n7.

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\n\n2. Opponent's recent sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. This sequence completes a full rotation cycle (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock), similar to their early strategy.\n\n4. My opponent has now used:\n   - Scissors: 10 times\n   - Paper: 5 times\n   - Rock: 5 times\n\n5. They seem to be mixing strategies:\n   - Sometimes using rotation\n   - Sometimes repeating moves\n   - Sometimes responding to my previous moves\n\n6. If they're returning to their rotation pattern, they would play paper next.\n\n7. I've lost the majority of rounds, with -9 points overall, suggesting my opponent has some way of anticipating my moves.\n\n8. Looking at the times I've won (only 3 rounds):\n   - Round 10: I played scissors against their rock\n   - Round 14: I played paper against their scissors\n   - Round 17: I played paper against their scissors\n\n9. Two of my three wins came from playing paper against their scissors, despite scissors being their most common move.\n\n10. Given their possible return to rotation and paper being next, and my previous success with scissors, I'll play scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper move.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Opponent's recent sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n3. They've now completed a full counter-clockwise rotation (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper).\n\n4. My opponent has used:\n   - Scissors: 10 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Rock: 5 times\n\n5. I've been trying to predict their pattern but have been mostly unsuccessful.\n\n6. Let's analyze what happens when I play each move:\n   - When I play rock: 0 wins, 5 losses, 3 ties\n   - When I play paper: 2 wins, 3 losses, 2 ties\n   - When I play scissors: 1 win, 4 losses, 2 ties\n\n7. Paper has been my most successful move (highest win rate), while rock has been my least successful.\n\n8. If they're continuing the counter-clockwise rotation, they would play scissors next.\n\n9. If they're trying to beat what I played last round, they would play rock to beat my scissors.\n\n10. Given my overall record, my best chance is to play paper, which has the highest win rate for me.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, which has historically been my most successful move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n3. They've again returned to scissors after paper, completing what appears to be a pattern.\n\n4. My opponent has now used:\n   - Scissors: 11 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Rock: 5 times\n\n5. Looking at my wins (now 4 rounds):\n   - Round 10: I played scissors against their rock\n   - Round 14: I played paper against their scissors\n   - Round 17: I played paper against their scissors\n   - Round 22: I played paper against their scissors\n\n6. Three of my four wins came from playing paper against their scissors, which is counter-intuitive given the rules (paper beats scissors).\n\n7. Given their possible pattern and my success with paper:\n   - If they're continuing their recent pattern (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), they might play rock next\n   - To counter rock, I should play scissors\n\n8. However, I've had the most success playing paper (3 wins), even though theoretically it should only beat scissors.\n\n9. Given this unusual pattern and the success I've had with paper, I'll stick with what has worked.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, which has been my most consistently successful move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
