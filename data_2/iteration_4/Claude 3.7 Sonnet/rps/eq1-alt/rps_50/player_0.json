    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors, without any history or patterns to analyze, no single move has an inherent advantage.\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have information on their tendencies.\n3. Some psychological research suggests that rock is the most common first move many people make, but I shouldn't rely too heavily on this pattern.\n4. If I anticipate my opponent might choose rock first, paper would be the optimal counter.\n5. However, if they anticipate I might think this way, they might choose scissors instead.\n6. This is the fundamental strategic dilemma of rock-paper-scissors - optimal play against a rational opponent requires randomization.\n7. For my first move, I'll choose paper, which beats rock if the opponent follows common patterns.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

According to the rules provided: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n3. So rock beats paper (not the traditional rock-paper-scissors rule where paper beats rock), which explains why I lost.\n4.

My cumulative score is back to -5 points.\n\n4. The opponent broke their scissors streak by switching to paper, which I incorrectly predicted.\n\n5. Looking at the entire history, they've now played:\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   - Paper: 6 times \n   - Scissors: 8 times\n\n6. According to the modified rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n7. The opponent seems to be adapting to counter my moves rather than following a consistent pattern.\n\n8. After playing paper, based on historical patterns, they've followed with:\n   - Paper again (3 times)\n   - Scissors (2 times) \n   - Rock (never observed)\n\n9. If they continue their historical tendency after paper, they're most likely to either play paper again or scissors.\n\n10. Given their adaptive play style and my recent losses, I'll play rock which would:\n    - Beat paper if they repeat it\n    - Tie with rock if they switch to it\n    - Lose to scissors if they switch to it\n\n11. I believe paper is their most likely move based on their historical patterns after playing paper, so rock is my best counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My cumulative score is now -6 points.\n\n4. The opponent has played scissors 9 times, paper 6 times, and rock 5 times, showing an overall preference for scissors.\n\n5. My attempt to predict their moves based on patterns has been largely unsuccessful. They appear to be either deliberately countering my moves or following a more complex pattern.\n\n6. According to the modified rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n7. Given their strong preference for scissors (9 out of 20 rounds, including their most recent move), paper would be the logical counter.\n\n8. Looking at the last 5 rounds (16-20), they've played scissors 4 times and paper once, suggesting an even stronger recent preference for scissors.\n\n9. I need to stop trying to detect complex patterns that may not exist and focus on countering their most statistically likely move based on recent history.\n\n10. Based on both overall and recent history, scissors is their most frequent move, and paper is the appropriate counter to scissors in this modified rule system.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

According to the modified rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n8. Given their strong recent preference for scissors and my success with paper against it, they might:\n   a) Continue with scissors if they're stubborn or following a specific pattern\n   b) Switch to rock to counter my successful paper play\n\n9. If they switch to rock, my paper would lose.\n   If they continue with scissors, my paper would win.\n\n10.

According to the modified rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n7. Given their extremely strong recent preference for scissors, they might:\n   a) Continue with scissors for a fourth time (which they've done before)\n   b) Finally switch to a different move\n\n8. When they've played scissors multiple times in a row previously:\n   - After 4 consecutive scissors (rounds 15-18), they switched to paper\n   - After 2 consecutive scissors (rounds 12-13), they switched to paper\n   - After 3 consecutive scissors (rounds 16-18), they continued with scissors\n\n9. Based on these patterns, if they do switch after 3 consecutive scissors, paper seems their most likely switch.\n\n10.
