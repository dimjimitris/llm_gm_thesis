Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In Rock-Paper-Scissors, people often follow patterns. After a tie, players frequently change their move.\n\n4.

After five consecutive losses, they are likely:\n   - Extremely frustrated\n   - Looking for any pattern to exploit\n   - Potentially resorting to completely random play\n\n5. If they've finally recognized my cyclical pattern (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 ...), they would expect rock next and play scissors to counter.\n\n6. However, after so many losses, they might think I'll change my strategy since it's been so predictable (even though successful).\n\n7. There's also a psychological tendency after multiple losses to revert to \"rock\" as it feels psychologically \"strongest.\"\n\n8. Another possibility is that they'll try paper, anticipating that I might break my pattern with scissors again.\n\n9. Considering all factors, I believe the opponent is most likely to play scissors - either to counter my expected rock or out of frustration to break my pattern.\n\n10. If I expect scissors, according to the rules (paper beats scissors), I should play paper.\n\n11.

According to the rules (paper beats scissors), I won and scored 1 point.\n\n2. My opponent continues to follow their entirely predictable pattern without any variation:\n   - When I play paper, they play scissors\n   - When I play scissors, they play rock\n   - When I play rock, they play paper\n\n3. After sixteen consecutive losses with absolutely no adaptation in strategy, I can predict with essentially 100% certainty that they will play rock next (to counter my expected scissors).\n\n4. If I expect rock, according to the rules (scissors beats rock), I should play scissors.\n\n5. This maintains my established winning cycle of paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, which has been flawlessly effective against this opponent.\n\n6. My running score is now +14 points (16 wins at +1 each, minus my one early loss at -1).\n\n7.
