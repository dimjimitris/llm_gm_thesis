Given that we tied with paper, my opponent might be less likely to use paper again, as they might be trying to avoid another tie. I'll choose rock, which is a move that can break the tie and potentially give me an advantage. Rock beats scissors, so if my opponent decides to use scissors, I'll have the upper hand. Rock also has the potential to give me 3 points if my opponent chooses paper, although this is less likely given that we just tied with paper. By choosing rock, I'm trying to take a proactive approach and force my opponent to adapt to my move.\n"

This is a significant development, as my opponent's paper move suggests that they might be trying to mix up their strategy. Given that my opponent lost with paper, they might be less likely to use it again, and more likely to try a different move. I'll choose scissors, which beats paper and gives me a chance to win if my opponent chooses paper again. Scissors also has a relatively low penalty if I lose, which is -1 point, compared to the -3 points I would get if I chose paper and my opponent chose rock. By choosing scissors, I'm trying to take a cautious approach and minimize my potential losses while still trying to capitalize on my opponent's potential mistakes.
