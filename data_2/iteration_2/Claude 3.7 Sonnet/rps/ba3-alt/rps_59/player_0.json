Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

First, let me understand the unique payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. This is not standard rock-paper-scissors. The payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins\n   - But rock also has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player:\n   - I have no prior information about their strategy\n   - Many players instinctively choose rock in the first round\n   - If they choose rock and I choose paper, I'd get +3 points\n   - If they choose scissors and I choose paper, I'd lose 1 point\n   - The risk/reward ratio favors paper as an opening move\n\n4. Paper seems to have a favorable expected value in this scenario:\n   - Against rock: +3 points\n   - Against scissors: -1 point\n   - Against paper: 0 points\n\n5. Given that rock has both the highest potential gain and loss, paper provides a good balance of potential high reward while limiting potential losses.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

According to the rules:\n   - Rock beats paper, giving the winner (my opponent) +3 points\n   - I lost and received -3 points\n\n2. Wait, this contradicts the rules as I understood them. The rules stated:\n   - \"Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\"\n   \n   So if my opponent played rock and I played paper, they should have won. This matches what happened, so the rules are being applied correctly.\n\n3. Now I need to think about my opponent's potential strategy:\n   - They chose rock in the first round\n   - Will they stick with rock since it worked, or anticipate that I'll switch?\n   - If they stick with rock, I should play scissors\n   - If they anticipate me switching to scissors, they might play paper\n   - If they play paper, I should play rock\n\n4. Given that my opponent won with rock, there's a reasonable chance they might:\n   - Stick with rock (winner's psychology - stay with what works)\n   - Or expect me to play rock to counter their previous rock, and thus play paper\n\n5. If I play scissors:\n   - Against rock: I win +1 points\n   - Against paper: I lose -1 points\n   - Against scissors: 0 points\n\n6. The expected value seems favorable for scissors, given what I know. Playing scissors would counter their first-round strategy and has balanced risk.\n\nFinal decision: I will switch to scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at my opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: They played rock\n   - Round 2: They played paper\n   - This suggests they might be following a sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - If this pattern holds, they'll play scissors next\n\n4. Let me re-evaluate the payoff structure:\n   - If they play scissors as predicted, and I play rock, I would win 1 point\n   - If they play rock again (cycling back), and I play rock, it would be a tie\n   - If they play paper again, and I play rock, I would lose 3 points\n\n5. Despite losing twice, I need to avoid falling into predictable counter-patterns myself. I've played paper then scissors, so my opponent might expect me to play rock next.\n\n6. Considering game theory:\n   - My opponent has won twice with different moves\n   - They may have identified a pattern in my play\n   - Breaking expected patterns is important\n\n7. Rock seems like the logical choice based on the observed sequence, but I should be wary of being too predictable.\n\n8. Given the information available, playing rock offers a reasonable expected value:\n   - It wins against scissors (+1 point) which follows their apparent sequence\n   - It ties against rock (0 points) if they repeat their first move\n   - It loses against paper (-3 points) if they repeat their second move\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Wait, there's a contradiction here. According to the rules:\n   - \"Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\"\n   \n   In Round 3, I played rock and my opponent played paper. By the rules, I should have lost 3 points. However, the outcome stated I won 3 points.

Let me reconsider the actual payoff structure based on the outcomes:\n   - Round 1: Paper vs Rock \u2192 Rock won (+3 points)\n   - Round 2: Scissors vs Paper \u2192 Paper won (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: Rock vs Paper \u2192 Rock won (+3 points)\n\n4.

I need to reassess my understanding of the rules based on the outcomes:\n   - Round 1: Paper vs Rock \u2192 I lost 3 points \u2192 Rock beats paper (-3 points penalty)\n   - Round 2: Scissors vs Paper \u2192 I lost 1 point \u2192 Paper beats scissors (-1 point penalty)\n   - Round 3: Rock vs Paper \u2192 I won 3 points \u2192 Rock beats paper (+3 points reward)\n   - Round 4: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I lost 1 point \u2192 Scissors beats rock (-1 point penalty)\n\n3. There's still inconsistency in my understanding. Let me review the original rules again:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n\n4. Applying these rules to Round 3 (Rock vs Paper), Rock should not beat Paper. I should have lost. This suggests that either:\n   - The outcomes are being reported incorrectly\n   - The rules were stated incorrectly\n   - There are additional factors not accounted for\n\n5. Taking Round 3 as an anomaly for now, and focusing on the other rounds where the outcomes make sense with the rules:\n   - My opponent's pattern: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - There's no clear predictable pattern, suggesting they might be making strategic decisions\n\n6. The opponent has now played each move at least once, showing versatility.\n\n7.

Since the opponent just played scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors if they think I'll play paper\n   - Switch to rock to counter my expected scissors\n   - Switch to paper to try a new approach\n\n10. Given that scissors was just played, and there's a tendency to avoid immediately repeating moves in games like this, paper has reasonably good odds.\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My record is currently 1 win and 4 losses, with a significant negative point total.\n\n4. Let's analyze if my opponent could be using a counter-strategy:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, they countered with rock\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, they played paper (not a counter)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, they played paper (not a counter)\n   - Round 4: I played rock again, they played scissors (counter)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, they played rock (counter)\n\n5. The last two rounds suggest they might be anticipating my moves and countering them.\n\n6. Looking at the entire game, Rock has appeared in my opponent's moves most frequently (2 times), suggesting they might favor it.\n\n7.

Analyzing their most recent moves:\n   - They played rock twice consecutively (Rounds 5-6)\n   - Then they switched to scissors (Round 7)\n   - This suggests they're willing to repeat moves but also make abrupt changes\n\n4. After scissors, players often play rock next (the natural progression in this game). However, my opponent has shown they don't always follow conventional patterns.\n\n5. Their move distribution: Rock (3 times), Paper (2 times), Scissors (2 times)\n   - Rock remains their most frequently played move\n   - They've now played all three options fairly evenly\n\n6.

It seems the game is being played with inverted RPS rules:\n   - Rock beats scissors (standard) \u2192 Scissors beats rock (inverted)\n   - Paper beats rock (standard) \u2192 Rock beats paper (inverted)\n   - Scissors beats paper (standard) \u2192 Paper beats scissors (inverted)\n\n5. My opponent's moves sequence: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   They've now played scissors three times, rock three times, and paper twice.\n\n6. They've played scissors twice in a row, which is a deviation from their earlier pattern.\n\n7. Under the inverted rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n8. Given they just played scissors again, they might:\n   - Play scissors a third time (less likely but possible)\n   - Switch to rock (following a pattern of repeating moves twice)\n   - Switch to paper (to mix things up)\n\n9. If I play Paper:\n   - Against Rock: I lose 3 points (inverted rules)\n   - Against Paper: Tie, 0 points\n   - Against Scissors: I win 1 point (inverted rules)\n\n10. Given that they've played scissors twice in a row, and paper beats scissors in this inverted game, paper seems to have the highest expected value.\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I notice they've played scissors in rounds 8 and 10, with a paper in between. This breaks their earlier pattern of playing the same move twice consecutively.\n\n4. Let me revisit the rules of this variant of rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n\n5. In this variant:\n   - Paper is strong against scissors but weak against rock\n   - Rock is strong against paper but weak against scissors\n   - Scissors is strong against rock but weak against paper\n\n6. Analyzing my opponent's recent choices:\n   - They've played scissors most frequently (4 times)\n   - They've played scissors in 2 of the last 3 rounds\n   - This suggests they might favor scissors\n\n7. To counter scissors in this variant, I should play paper:\n   - Paper beats scissors: I would win 1 point\n   - Paper loses to rock: I would lose 3 points\n   - Paper ties with paper: 0 points\n\n8. Given their recent preference for scissors and the fact they've played scissors in 2 out of the last 3 rounds, paper seems to have a positive expected value.\n\n9. However, they might anticipate this and switch to rock. They've shown they can be unpredictable.\n\n10. The safest play might be scissors, as it:\n    - Beats rock (if they switch to counter my expected paper play)\n    - Loses only 1 point to paper (if they try to be tricky)\n    - Ties with scissors (if they continue their scissors streak)\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After following a clear pattern for many rounds, my opponent has now deviated. Instead of playing paper (which would beat their previous rock in standard RPS), they played scissors.\n\n4. This suggests my opponent has likely detected that I identified their pattern and has now changed their strategy. This makes sense after I won five rounds in a row by correctly countering their moves.\n\n5. In our inverted game:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n6. Given this change, I can consider several possibilities:\n   - They've abandoned their pattern entirely and are now playing randomly\n   - They're using a new pattern\n   - They anticipate I'll continue to predict based on their old pattern\n\n7. If they anticipate me following their previous pattern, they might expect me to play paper next (since they played scissors, and following their old pattern, I would expect rock and counter with paper).\n\n8. To counter this potential counter-strategy, I should not play paper. Instead, I could play scissors, which would:\n   - Beat rock if they return to their original pattern\n   - Tie against scissors if they repeat scissors\n   - Lose only 1 point to paper if they try to counter my expected move\n\n9. Since they just broke their pattern with scissors, it's unlikely they'll play scissors again immediately. They might play rock (returning to their original pattern) or paper (to counter what they think I might play).\n\n10. Given the uncertainty introduced by their pattern break, scissors offers the most balanced risk/reward profile.\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors for this round, accounting for the increased uncertainty while still positioning myself advantageously against their most likely moves.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at their recent moves:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   \n   After breaking their pattern in Round 18 by playing scissors instead of the expected paper, they've now played rock. This could mean:\n   - They're returning to their original pattern (playing what would beat their previous move in standard RPS)\n   - They're using a different pattern\n   - They played randomly\n\n4. If they're returning to their original pattern, after playing rock, they would play paper next (to beat rock in standard RPS).\n\n5. In our inverted game:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n6. If they play paper next (returning to their original pattern), I should play rock to counter it in our inverted game.\n\n7. However, given their recent deviation, I need to be more cautious. They might:\n   - Return completely to their original pattern (play paper)\n   - Continue with some new strategy (unknown)\n   - Try to counter what they think I'll play based on pattern recognition\n\n8.

Since they just played rock and have shown a tendency to return to patterns (even after deviation), playing rock offers the highest potential reward if they return to their pattern and play paper.\n\n10. The risk of playing rock is relatively low (losing 1 point against scissors) compared to the potential reward (gaining 3 points against paper).\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock for this round, predicting they will likely return to their established pattern and play paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

In their original pattern (playing what would beat their previous move in standard RPS), after scissors they would play rock.\n\n5. In our inverted game:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n6. Since they just played scissors, they might:\n   - Play rock (following their original pattern)\n   - Play paper (to counter what they might think I'll play)\n   - Play scissors again (less likely)\n\n7. Checking the expected outcomes:\n   - If I play Scissors:\n     - Against Rock: I win 1 point\n     - Against Paper: I lose 1 point\n     - Against Scissors: Tie, 0 points\n\n   - If I play Rock:\n     - Against Rock: Tie, 0 points\n     - Against Paper: I win 3 points\n     - Against Scissors: I lose 1 point\n\n   - If I play Paper:\n     - Against Rock: I lose 3 points\n     - Against Paper: Tie, 0 points\n     - Against Scissors: I win 1 point\n\n8. Given that they just broke their streak of playing paper three times in a row by switching to scissors, it's reasonable to think they might return to their original pattern, which would mean playing rock next (to beat scissors in standard RPS).\n\n9. If they play rock as anticipated, scissors would counter this well in our inverted game.\n\n10. The risk of playing scissors is relatively low (losing 1 point against paper) compared to the potential reward (gaining 1 point against rock).\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors for this round, anticipating they will likely play rock following their original pattern after scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
