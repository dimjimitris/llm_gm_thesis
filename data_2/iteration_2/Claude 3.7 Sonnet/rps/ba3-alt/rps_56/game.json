First, I need to understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same move results in a tie (0 points)\n\n2. Since this is the first round, I have no prior information about my opponent's strategy.\n\n3. Looking at the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Winning with rock gives the highest points (3)\n   - Losing to rock costs the most points (-3)\n   - Other wins/losses are just \u00b11 point\n\n4. The expected value calculation for random play would be:\n   - For rock: (0 + 3 - 1)/3 = 2/3 points on average\n   - For paper: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3 points on average\n   - For scissors: (0 + 1 - 1)/3 = 0 points on average\n\n5. Since we're playing against a fresh player with no established patterns, and rock has the highest expected value against random play, I'll choose rock for my first move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given this high variability, I should focus on maximizing my expected value:\n   - If I play rock: I tie against rock, win/lose against paper (inconsistent), lose against scissors\n   - If I play paper: I lose against rock, tie against paper, win against scissors (assuming standard rules)\n   - If I play scissors: I win against rock (based on Round 4), lose against paper, tie against scissors\n\n6. Their overall distribution: 4 rocks, 5 papers, 1 scissors\n   Their most common move is paper, followed by rock.\n\n7. Since scissors has won against rock (Round 4) and paper seems to be their most common move historically, scissors might give me the best chance.\n\n8. However, they just played rock and might continue with it (as they did in the early rounds). In that case, scissors would be a good counter.\n\n9. Considering the balance of probabilities and previous outcomes, I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Their overall distribution: 4 rocks, 6 papers, 2 scissors\n   Paper remains their most common move\n\n6. Based on the observed (not stated) rules:\n   - Rock seems to beat paper (Rounds 5 & 12)\n   - Scissors seems to beat rock (Round 8) but also loses to rock (contrary to Round 4)\n   - Paper consistently beats scissors (Rounds 2 & 7)\n\n7. If they continue their rotation pattern, they might play rock next\n\n8. If they play rock:\n   - Based on Round 4, scissors would win\n   - Based on Round 8 (more recent), scissors would lose\n   - Paper lost against rock in Round 3\n\n9.

Their recent moves:\n   paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   They've switched from a scissors streak to rock\n\n5. Analyzing their potential strategy:\n   - They might be trying to counter my moves, anticipating I would continue with paper\n   - They may continue with rock since it was successful\n   - Given their history of sticking with moves for multiple rounds, rock is a possibility\n\n6. Based on the confirmed rules:\n   - Against rock: Scissors would be the best counter (+1 point)\n   - Against paper: Rock would be best (+3 points)\n   - Against scissors: Paper would be best (+1 point)\n\n7. Since they just played rock and had success, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (following their pattern of repeating successful moves)\n   - Switch to scissors (anticipating I might play scissors to counter their rock)\n\n8. Given their tendency to stick with successful moves for multiple rounds and the fact that scissors beats rock under these rules, I'll play scissors to counter their likely rock play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Based on the confirmed reverse rules:\n   - Against paper: Rock would be best (+3 points)\n   - Against scissors: Paper would be best (+1 point)\n\n7. Since they just had success with paper against my scissors, and they often repeat successful moves, paper is likely their next move.\n\n8.
