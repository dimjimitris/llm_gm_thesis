This confirms that traditional rock-paper-scissors rules are now in effect, where:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nMy opponent played paper again despite losing the previous round. This could indicate:\n1) They're testing if the rules are consistent\n2) They're trying to get me to switch my move\n3) They have a specific strategy in mind\n\nSince they've played paper twice in a row and lost both times, they're likely to switch. Most likely to scissors (which would beat my rock). I'll play:\n\n[move] Paper\n"
