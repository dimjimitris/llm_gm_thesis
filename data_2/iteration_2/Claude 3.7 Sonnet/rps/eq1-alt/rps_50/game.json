This is the first move against a fresh player, so I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n3.

Looking at these rules again, it seems that the traditional rock-paper-scissors relationships are reversed in this game.\n4. Given this understanding, my opponent played rock in the first round, which indeed beats paper according to these rules.\n5. If I assume my opponent might stick with rock since it worked before, I should play scissors to beat their rock.\n6. However, they might anticipate this and switch to paper to counter scissors.\n7.

Round 1-11 summary: My opponent played rock 9 times, scissors 2 times, and paper 1 time.\n2. Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points)\n3. My opponent's moves: rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192paper\n4. After losing 4 consecutive rounds with rock against my scissors, my opponent has finally switched to paper.\n5. This shows they are capable of adapting their strategy, though they took a long time to do so.\n6. Their switch to paper successfully countered my scissors, suggesting they anticipated my move.\n7. They might continue with paper expecting me to play scissors again, or they could return to their favored rock.\n8. If they play paper again, I should use rock to counter it.\n9. If they return to rock, I should use scissors again.\n10. My current score is 0 points (-1+0+1+0-1+1-1-1+1+1+1-1), back to neutral.\n11. Given that they've only just started to adapt after a very long pattern, and paper is their least used move historically, they might revert to their comfort zone of playing rock.\n12. However, their successful adaptation suggests they might stick with paper for at least one more round.\n\nFinal decision: Given my opponent has just successfully adapted their strategy for the first time, I'll play rock this round, anticipating they might continue with paper to try to extend their success.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

          "text": "I need to carefully reassess my opponent's strategy as it continues to evolve. Let me think step-by-step.\n\nSteps:\n1. Round 1-22 summary: My opponent played rock 9 times, scissors 7 times, and paper 6 times.\n2. Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points)\n3. My opponent's moves: rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192paper\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192paper\n4. After playing scissors twice in a row, my opponent has switched to paper.\n5. They've become more unpredictable in recent rounds, making it harder to discern a clear pattern.\n6. Their overall game shows they do switch moves, but not always in predictable ways.\n7. After winning with paper against my scissors, they might:\n   a) Continue with paper, as they've shown a tendency to stick with successful moves\n   b) Switch to rock anticipating I'll play paper to counter their paper\n   c) Switch to scissors anticipating I'll play rock to counter their expected paper\n8. Given their history of often sticking with moves after wins, paper seems likely again.\n9. If they play paper again, I should use rock.\n10. If they switch to rock, I should use scissors.\n11. If they switch to scissors, I should use paper.\n12. My current score is +1 point (-1+0+1+0-1+1-1-1+1+1+1-1+1-1+1+0+1-1+1+0-1+1-1), reduced again.\n\nFinal decision: Since my opponent has often shown a pattern of sticking with moves after winning with them, and has just won with paper, I'll play rock this round, anticipating they will likely continue with paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
