Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In a classical rock-paper-scissors game against a fresh player who hasn't shown any patterns yet, there is no clear optimal first move.\n2. Each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal chance of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n3. Since I have no prior information about my opponent's tendencies, I should consider what most people might play first.\n4. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n5. If that's true, playing paper would be advantageous against a first-time rock player.\n6. However, sophisticated players might anticipate this and play scissors first.\n7. Without more information, I need to make my choice based on limited strategic reasoning.\n8. Given the cyclic nature of the game, I'll choose paper as my first move, with the reasoning that rock is a common first choice.\n\n[move] paper\n"

However, since I was told I lost, there are two possibilities:\n   a) There was a miscommunication about the outcome\n   b) The rules might be different from what I understood\n\n6. Let me proceed assuming the reported outcome is correct, which would mean rock beats paper in this game (opposite of traditional rock-paper-scissors).\n7.

If they continue their pattern (which is virtually certain), their next move will be paper.\n5. Since rock beats paper in this game, I should play rock.\n6. After 20 rounds of the same pattern, the chance they would suddenly change their strategy is essentially zero.\n7. The optimal strategy remains exploiting their perfect predictability.\n\n8. Based on their established cycle, I'll play rock to counter their expected paper move.\n\n[move] rock\n"
