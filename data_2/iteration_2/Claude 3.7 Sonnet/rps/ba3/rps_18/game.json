They appear to be anticipating my moves well again.\n\nAfter this successful paper play, they might:\n1. Continue with paper if they think I'll play rock again\n2. Switch to scissors anticipating I'll counter with paper\n3. Play rock if they think I'll try scissors to counter their paper\n\nGiven that they've had two successful predictions in a row, they may be gaining confidence in their ability to read my strategy. Since they just played paper successfully, they might anticipate I'll play scissors to counter paper, and therefore play rock.\n\nI need to break their momentum with a less predictable move:\n\n[move] Paper\n"
