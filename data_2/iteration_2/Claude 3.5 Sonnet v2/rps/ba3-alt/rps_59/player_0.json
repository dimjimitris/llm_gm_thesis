    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the payoff matrix:\n- Paper vs Rock: Win 1 / Lose -3\n- Rock vs Scissors: Win 3 / Lose -1 \n- Scissors vs Paper: Win 1 / Lose -1\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player:\n- They have no prior knowledge of my strategy\n- I have no information about their tendencies\n- This is essentially a first-move situation\n\n3. Evaluating the risk/reward for each move:\n- Rock has highest potential win (3) but moderate loss (-1)\n- Paper has moderate win (1) but highest loss (-3)\n- Scissors has moderate win (1) and lowest loss (-1)\n\n4. Strategic consideration:\n- Without prior information, it's best to minimize potential losses\n- Scissors has the most balanced risk/reward profile\n- Many players tend to choose Rock as first move, making Paper tempting\n\n5. Decision making:\n- While Paper could be good against a likely Rock play\n- The risk of -3 points is too high for a first move\n- Scissors offers decent upside with minimal downside\n\n[move] scissors My first move - choosing a balanced risk/reward option\n"

Game situation:\n- Very strong lead at +11\n- Near end of game\n- They need 12+ points to win\n- Almost mathematically eliminated\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n- Their sequence: scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\n- They're varying moves trying to catch up\n- Just lost with paper\n- Showing signs of desperation\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n- They're in must-win situation\n- Likely extremely desperate\n- Might make very aggressive play\n- Could be tilting after last loss\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n- With +11 lead, can play ultra-conservative\n- They must win multiple +3 points\n- Small point exchanges won't help them\n- Can afford any single loss\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n- They must play for big points\n- Rock gives them best winning chance\n- Paper is risky after they just lost with it\n- Scissors is optimal here:\n  * Only loses -1 to rock if they go aggressive\n  * Beats paper if they repeat\n  * Safe play protects big lead\n  * Conservative approach when ahead\n  * They might avoid paper after just losing with it\n  * Even if we lose, maintain strong lead\n\n[move] scissors Playing safely to protect nearly insurmountable lead\n"
