Switch to rock to try to beat paper (in reversed rules)\n\nWith the reversed rules firmly established:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\n[move] scissors\n\nI'm choosing scissors because I think my opponent might switch to rock after our paper tie. They might expect me to stay with paper or switch to rock myself. According to the reversed rules, scissors beats rock. If they stay with paper, rock would beat my scissors according to standard rules (though in these reversed rules, paper beats scissors).\n"
