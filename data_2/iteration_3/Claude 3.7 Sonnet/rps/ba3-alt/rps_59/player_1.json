    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure first:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. This is not the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors payoff matrix:\n   - Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest risk (-3)\n   - Paper and Scissors have lower rewards/penalties (+1/-1)\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history:\n   - I should avoid being too predictable\n   - The opponent might start with rock as it's a common first move\n   - If they play rock, scissors would lose badly (-3)\n   - If they play scissors, paper would lose (-1)\n   - If they play paper, rock would win big (+3)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock is high-risk, high-reward\n   - In the first move with no information, a balanced choice seems prudent\n\n5. Decision: I will choose rock for the first move because:\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I lose 3 points\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If opponent chooses rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - This gives me a chance at the highest payoff while being a classic opening move\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyzing the previous round:\n   - I played rock\n   - My opponent played paper\n   - I won and scored 3 points\n   - Wait, this doesn't match the payoff matrix described... According to the rules, rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points. This means I should have lost 3 points. There might be a misunderstanding or the game rules might be different.\n\n2. Let me reconsider the rules in case I misunderstood:\n   - Maybe the rules were: paper beats rock (not scissors), rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper?\n   - Or maybe there was an error in reporting the outcome?\n\n3. Regardless of the confusion, I should respond to the fact that my opponent played paper last round:\n   - If they maintain the same strategy, they might play paper again\n   - If they anticipate me changing, they might change to rock or scissors\n   - Since I supposedly won with rock against paper (contrary to standard rules), playing rock again could be beneficial\n\n4. Strategy considerations:\n   - Given the uncertainty about rule interpretation, I should make a strategic choice that works well in multiple scenarios\n   - If scissors beats paper in the traditional way, that would be a good counter\n   - If rock somehow beats paper (as suggested by the previous round's outcome), rock would be good again\n\n5. Decision: I will choose scissors this round because:\n   - It traditionally beats paper (which my opponent played last time)\n   - It diversifies my play style, making me less predictable\n   - Even if I'm misinterpreting something, varying my strategy helps gather more information\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Wait, this result contradicts the rules again:\n   - In Round 7, I won with paper against scissors\n   - In Round 9, I won with paper against scissors\n   - But in Round 2, I lost with scissors against paper\n\n3. Let me verify the consistent rule pattern again:\n   - Rule pattern from rounds 3-9 consistently shows:\n     - Rock beats paper (+3/-3 points)\n     - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points) \n     - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n   \n   This is the pattern I've been working with lately, and it's producing consistent results.\n\n4.

My performance:\n   - I've won 4 consecutive rounds by correctly anticipating their pattern\n   - They might finally realize their predictability and change strategy\n\n6. Prediction analysis:\n   - If they continue their strict alternating pattern, they should play rock next\n   - Against rock, scissors would win (+1)\n   - They might realize I've figured out their pattern and play paper to surprise me\n   - If they play paper, rock would win big (+3)\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - My opponent has been extremely predictable with their rock-scissors alternation\n   - If they're observant, they should break this pattern now\n   - I've won 4 times in a row, which might make them change strategy\n   - Their dominant strategy has been rock and scissors, with no paper for several rounds\n\n8. Decision: I will play scissors this round because:\n   - It beats rock if they continue their alternating pattern (+1)\n   - Even if they break pattern with paper, the penalty (-1) is less than if I guess rock and face scissors (-1)\n   - The pattern has been so consistent that one more prediction based on it seems reasonable\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Their adaptation suggests:\n   - They recognized I might be predicting their rock-scissors alternation\n   - They're now trying to counter my counter-moves\n   - They might be analyzing my pattern now\n\n4. My recent pattern:\n   - Round 15-18: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - I've been alternating between scissors and paper\n   - If they notice this, they might expect scissors next\n\n5. Strategic options:\n   - If they expect scissors and play paper to counter, I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they expect scissors but try to be clever with rock, I should play paper (+3)\n   - If they go back to their previous pattern (which would be scissors next), paper would win (+1)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock has highest reward potential (+3) if they play paper\n   - Paper is risky (-3) if they play rock\n   - Scissors is moderately risky (-1) if they play paper\n\n7. Psychological analysis:\n   - After a tie, they might try to gain advantage by predicting my next move\n   - They've shown they can break patterns when needed\n   - They might expect me to continue my scissors-paper alternation\n\n8. Decision: I will play rock this round because:\n   - It breaks my own alternating pattern, making me less predictable\n   - It would win big against paper if they repeat their last move (+3)\n   - After they just switched to paper, there's a reasonable chance they might stick with it\n   - Even if they switch to scissors, the loss (-1) is acceptable for the chance at a bigger win\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analysis of their strategy:\n   - After the tie with paper, they went back to scissors\n   - This suggests they might be trying to predict my moves rather than following a fixed pattern\n   - They correctly anticipated I might play rock after paper\n\n4. My pattern consideration:\n   - I need to avoid being predictable\n   - They've shown they can adapt to counter my moves\n   - I should introduce more randomness while still trying to make strategic choices\n\n5.

Psychological analysis:\n   - After successfully countering my move, they might be confident in their ability to predict me\n   - They might expect me to play paper to counter their scissors\n   - If so, they might play rock to counter my paper\n\n7. Decision: I will play scissors this round because:\n   - It would win against rock if they try to counter my expected paper play (+1)\n   - It breaks any predictable pattern they might have identified\n   - Even if they play paper, the loss (-1) is acceptable as part of maintaining unpredictability\n   - They've played scissors twice recently, so rock is a reasonable next move for them\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Interesting observation:\n   - In rounds 17 and 20, I played scissors and they played rock, and I won both times\n   - This confirms scissors beats rock consistently (+1 points)\n   - They've played rock multiple times and lost to scissors\n\n4.

Updated round history:\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n\n2. Rule contradiction in Round 21:\n   - I played rock against paper and won 3 points\n   - According to the rules I've been using, rock should lose to paper\n   - This suggests either:\n     a) The rules have changed\n     b) There was an error in reporting the outcome\n     c) My understanding of the rules was incorrect\n\n3. Let me reassess the rules based on recent consistent outcomes:\n   - Round 19: Rock vs Scissors = I lost (-1) \u2192 Scissors beats Rock\n   - Round 20: Scissors vs Rock = I won (+1) \u2192 Scissors beats Rock\n   - Round 21: Rock vs Paper = I won (+3) \u2192 Rock beats Paper\n\n4. The updated rule understanding appears to be:\n   - Rock beats Paper (+3/-3 points)\n   - Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1 points)\n   - Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1 points)\n\n5. This is consistent with my original understanding of the rules, so I'll continue with this model.\n\n6. Opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: paper\n   - Round 19: scissors\n   - Round 20: rock\n   - Round 21: paper\n   - They seem to be cycling through different moves without a clear pattern\n\n7. Strategic options:\n   - If they play scissors next (continuing a paper\u2192scissors pattern), paper would win (+1)\n   - If they play rock next, scissors would win (+1)\n   - If they play paper again, rock would win (+3)\n\n8. Psychological analysis:\n   - After losing with paper against my rock, they likely won't repeat paper\n   - They might expect me to play rock again since it just worked well\n   - If they think I'll play rock, they might play scissors to counter\n\n9. Decision: I will play paper this round because:\n   - It would win against scissors if they try to counter my expected rock play (+1)\n   - It's a safe play that breaks the pattern of my last move\n   - Even if they play rock, the loss (-3) is acceptable after my big win\n   - This maintains unpredictability while making a strategic choice\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Wait, this result again contradicts my understanding of the rules:\n   - I played paper against scissors and won 1 point\n   - According to the rules, scissors should beat paper, not the other way around\n\n3. Let me review the original rules again to ensure I understand:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\" - So paper beats scissors\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\" - Rock beats paper\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\" - Scissors beats rock\n\n4. This is the exact opposite of traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors, but it's been consistently supported by the results:\n   - Rock beats Paper: +3/-3 points\n   - Paper beats Scissors: +1/-1 points\n   - Scissors beats Rock: +1/-1 points\n\n5. My performance:\n   - I've won the last 3 out of 4 rounds\n   - My predictions and strategy seem to be working well\n\n6. Opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 19: scissors\n   - Round 20: rock\n   - Round 21: paper\n   - Round 22: scissors\n   - They've gone scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors, which could suggest they're starting to repeat a pattern\n\n7. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue the pattern, they might play rock next\n   - Against rock, scissors would win (+1)\n   - If they break pattern with paper, rock would win (+3)\n   - If they repeat scissors, paper would win (+1)\n\n8. Psychological analysis:\n   - After losing with scissors against my paper, they might avoid scissors\n   - They might expect me to play paper again since it just worked\n   - If they think I'll play paper, they might play rock to counter\n\n9.
