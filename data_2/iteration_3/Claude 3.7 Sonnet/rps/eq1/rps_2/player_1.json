Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "I'll think step-by-step to determine my best move for this twenty-third round.\n\nSteps:\n1. Let's review the most recent game history:\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played scissors - tie\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played scissors - tie\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I won\n\n2. My opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   They've played scissors three times in a row, which is remarkable.\n\n3. I finally broke my losing streak by correctly playing rock against their scissors.\n\n4. Their choice to play scissors a third time was unexpected - it suggests they might be:\n   - Following some pattern I haven't fully detected\n   - Being deliberately unpredictable\n   - Or they expected me to overthink and play paper\n\n5. After losing with scissors (after playing it three times), they're very likely to switch moves.\n\n6. Common strategies after losing would suggest:\n   - They might play rock (the move that would have beaten my move)\n   - They might play paper (the only move they haven't played recently)\n   - They're unlikely to play scissors again after three consecutive scissors moves\n\n7. If they're using a higher-level strategy, they might anticipate that I'll play rock again (after my success) and counter with paper.\n\n8. Alternatively, they might expect me to anticipate their paper and play scissors, leading them to play rock.\n\n9. Given their unusual choice to play scissors three times, I can't rely on conventional pattern recognition.\n\n10. However, the most psychologically probable move after losing with a move played three times in a row is to switch to a different move.\n\n11. Between rock and paper, paper seems more likely as it would counter my successful rock from the previous round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their likely paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   They finally switched from scissors to rock and won with it.\n\n3. Looking at their longer sequence:\n   - Round 19: rock\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - Round 21: scissors\n   - Round 22: scissors\n   - Round 23: rock\n\n4. They've now played rock twice with a series of scissors in between, winning with rock both times against my scissors.\n\n5. After winning with rock, they might:\n   - Play rock again (persistence with success)\n   - Anticipate I'll play paper to counter their rock and play scissors\n   - Try to stay unpredictable by playing paper\n\n6. Given that they've won with rock against my scissors twice now, they might expect me to avoid scissors and play either rock (for a tie) or paper (to win).\n\n7. If they think I'll play paper to counter their rock, they would play scissors.\n\n8. If they think I'll play rock to avoid losing to their rock again, they would play paper.\n\n9. Their pattern throughout the game has shown they're capable of adapting and anticipating my moves.\n\n10. Since I just lost to rock with scissors, the most obvious move would be for me to play paper.\n\n11. Given their demonstrated ability to anticipate obvious moves, they're likely to expect paper from me and play scissors to counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter their likely scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"
