Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The opponent's last three moves have been: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n3. Overall pattern: paper (4 times), rock (4 times), scissors (3 times)\n4. After the tie with scissors, there are several possibilities:\n   - The opponent might expect me to switch away from scissors\n   - They might switch away from scissors themselves\n   - They might stick with scissors expecting me to overthink\n5. When we previously had a tie (round 1), the opponent repeated their move in the next round.\n6. Given that we tied with scissors, and based on their previous behavior after a tie, they might play scissors again.\n7. However, their overall pattern suggests they don't often repeat the same move multiple times.\n8. After scissors, they've most commonly played paper in previous rounds.\n9. Since they switched from rock to scissors last round, it suggests they're trying to be less predictable.\n10. If they think I'll switch to rock (to beat their expected scissors), they would play paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again, anticipating they might play paper after this tie, or repeat scissors hoping I'll switch.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

After 10 consecutive losses, they might:\n   - Continue their pattern (playing paper to counter my rock)\n   - Finally break their pattern out of extreme frustration\n7. Given their remarkably consistent behavior throughout the entire game, despite suffering numerous losses, they're most likely to continue their established pattern.\n8.
