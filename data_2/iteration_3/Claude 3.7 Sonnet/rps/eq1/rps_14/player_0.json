Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is the first round against a fresh player, so I don't have any data on their patterns or preferences.\n2. In the absence of information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal chance of winning, losing, or tying.\n3. Since this is a zero-sum game with symmetric payoffs, there's no inherent advantage to any particular move.\n4. The Nash equilibrium for rock-paper-scissors is to play each option with equal probability (1/3).\n5. However, there are some psychological tendencies in humans:\n   - Rock is often chosen first by many players because it seems \"strong\"\n   - Paper is chosen least frequently in first moves\n6. Given this is likely the first move, countering rock (with paper) might be advantageous.\n7. However, if the other player anticipates this and chooses scissors, I would lose.\n8. Without specific information, I'll make a strategic first move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

One common strategy in RPS is to play what would have beaten your opponent's last move\n   - Their last move was scissors, so I would play rock (which beats scissors)\n5. Another consideration: people often avoid repeating the same move immediately\n6. Given that my opponent won with scissors, there's a psychological tendency to stick with winning moves\n7.

Analyzing recent developments:\n   - They've now played rock 4 times, scissors 5 times, and paper only once\n   - They seem to alternate between rock and scissors frequently\n   - After a scissors play, they've now played rock twice\n\n4. After our ties (rounds 4 and 5), their next moves were scissors and paper\n   - This could indicate they try to win after ties rather than play for another tie\n\n5. My current score remains -1 overall (still in deficit)\n\n6. Following a tie with rock, their possible moves:\n   - Paper (to beat my potential rock repeat)\n   - Rock (repeat their last move)\n   - Scissors (their most frequent choice overall)\n\n7. Given their history, paper seems like a strong possibility after our rock tie\n   - They previously moved to scissors and paper after ties\n   - They might expect me to play rock again\n\n8. To counter paper, scissors would be optimal\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, anticipating they might play paper to beat my potential repeated rock after our tie.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Updated observations:\n   - They played scissors again, resulting in a tie\n   - This is their 7th time playing scissors, matching their rock count (7), with paper at 4\n   - After our previous ties (rounds 4, 5, 10), their next moves were scissors, scissors, and paper\n   - My overall score remains 0 (even)\n\n4. Analyzing their behavior after ties:\n   - After the rock-rock tie in round 4, they played scissors\n   - After the scissors-scissors tie in round 5, they played scissors again\n   - After the rock-rock tie in round 10, they played paper\n   - No clear pattern emerges for their post-tie behavior\n\n5. Given this scissors-scissors tie, they might:\n   - Play scissors again (they've shown willingness to repeat moves even after ties)\n   - Switch to rock (to counter my potential scissors repeat)\n   - Switch to paper (to change strategy)\n\n6. Considering their overall play distribution and our recent scissors tie:\n   - Rock would be a safe play against their potential scissors repeat\n   - Rock would lose to their potential paper\n   - Rock would win against their most frequent non-paper choice (scissors)\n\n7. Paper would be risky as they play scissors frequently, but would win against potential rock\n\n8. Given their tendency to play scissors frequently and that they've just played it, rock seems optimal\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, which should counter their scissors if they repeat it and has generally been successful against their strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Considering general tendencies after ties:\n   - There's a psychological tendency to change moves after a tie\n   - They might expect me to play paper to beat their rock\n   - To counter my expected paper, they might play scissors\n\n6. However, given their overall preference for rock:\n   - They might simply play rock again\n   - Or switch to paper, which they've used less frequently\n\n7. Paper would beat their rock if they repeat it, but lose to scissors\n   - Given their slight preference for rock over scissors, paper has a slightly better than 50% chance\n   \n8. Given their history and the rock-rock tie, paper appears to be the optimal move with acceptable risk\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, which should win if they play rock again and aligns with the typical strategy of changing moves after a tie.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Last time we had a rock-rock tie (round 19), they played scissors next, which I tried to counter with paper but lost\n\n7. Given this history:\n   - They might play scissors again after our rock tie (which they've done twice)\n   - They might play paper (which they did once after a rock tie)\n   - They're least likely to play rock again based on past tie behavior\n\n8.
