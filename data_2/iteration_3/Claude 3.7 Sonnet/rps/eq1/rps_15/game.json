This is my first round against a fresh player, meaning there's no prior history to analyze.\n2. In Rock-Paper-Scissors without prior information, no single move has a mathematical advantage.\n3. Each move (rock, paper, scissors) has a 1/3 probability of winning, 1/3 probability of losing, and 1/3 probability of tying.\n4. Without any pattern to exploit, I should consider randomizing my choice.\n5. However, psychological research suggests that in the first round of RPS, people slightly favor rock as an opening move.\n6. If the opponent is more likely to play rock first, then paper would be the strategic counter.\n7. That said, if the opponent is thinking at this level, they might anticipate this and play scissors instead.\n8. Since we have no reliable information, I'll go with paper as my first move based on the slight psychological advantage against first-time players.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This gives me one data point about my opponent's behavior - they chose scissors in the first round.\n3. There are several possibilities for my opponent's strategy:\n   a) They might consistently play scissors\n   b) They might follow a rotating pattern (e.g., scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper)\n   c) They might anticipate my next move based on my previous loss\n   d) They might be playing randomly\n4. The most common reaction after winning with scissors is to play scissors again, thinking it was successful.\n5. Another common strategy is for players to switch to what would have beaten their previous move, which would mean my opponent might play rock now.\n6. If I assume they'll play scissors again, I should play rock to counter.\n7. If I assume they'll play rock (anticipating I'll switch to rock), I should play paper.\n8. Since I have limited data, I'll counter the most recent move they made. They played scissors last time, so I'll play rock to counter scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has played scissors, then rock - this could indicate they might be following a rotation pattern of scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper.\n3. If they are following this pattern, they will likely play paper next.\n4. Another possibility is that after a tie, players often shift to what would have beaten their previous move, thinking the opponent will repeat their move. This would mean my opponent might play paper.\n5. Both analyses suggest my opponent is likely to play paper in this round.\n6. To counter paper, I should play scissors.\n7. However, if my opponent is thinking more deeply, they might anticipate me playing scissors and play rock instead.\n8.

My opponent might abandon their rotation after losing the last round.\n5. Players who just lost often switch to what would have beaten their opponent's last move. Since I played scissors, they might play rock.\n6. Both the rotation pattern analysis and the psychological reaction to losing suggest my opponent will likely play rock next.\n7.

Let me analyze the pattern of moves so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n\n2. Looking at my opponent's sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   This confirms they've maintained their rotation pattern perfectly through twenty-one rounds.\n\n3. According to this established pattern, they would play scissors next.\n\n4. I've now won 17 games in a row by correctly predicting their pattern, and they've demonstrated perfect consistency in their rotation.\n\n5. Their unwavering commitment to the same rotation pattern for 21 consecutive rounds, despite losing consistently, confirms they will continue with this sequence.\n\n6. If they play scissors next as the pattern predicts, I should play rock to counter it.\n\n7. There is no doubt at this point that they will continue their predetermined pattern without any adaptation.\n\n8. Based on their established rotation pattern that has remained consistent for 21 rounds, I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

If they play rock next as the pattern predicts, I should play paper to counter it.\n\n7. The game has become perfectly predictable, with the opponent following a fixed rotation regardless of outcomes.\n\n8. Based on their established rotation pattern that has remained consistent for 22 rounds, I'll play paper to counter their expected rock move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
