Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I'll analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. I notice the payoffs are asymmetric - paper beating rock has a higher payoff/penalty (+3/-3) than the other wins (+1/-1).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n4. Given the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential gain (+3), making it tempting.\n\n5. However, if the opponent anticipates this and plays scissors, I'd lose 1 point.\n\n6. Rock is a safer play in terms of potential loss (-3 if opponent plays paper vs -1 if I play paper and opponent plays scissors).\n\n7. But paper has the best risk-reward ratio given the asymmetric payoffs.\n\n8. For a first move with no prior information, I'll choose paper to potentially gain the highest payoff.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for the potential higher reward.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This could indicate several things:\n   - My opponent might have anticipated my paper strategy\n   - My opponent might prefer scissors as an opening move\n   - My opponent might have made a random choice that happened to counter mine\n\n3. If my opponent tends to repeat successful moves, they might play scissors again.\n\n4. If my opponent anticipates that I'll change my move after losing, they might expect me to play rock (which beats scissors) and respond with paper.\n\n5. The payoff structure remains the same, with paper vs rock having the highest stakes (+3/-3).\n\n6. Since I lost to scissors last round, playing rock would be a logical counter if my opponent repeats their move.\n\n7. Playing rock has:\n   - Win scenario: If opponent plays scissors again (+1)\n   - Loss scenario: If opponent plays paper (-3)\n   - Tie scenario: If opponent plays rock (0)\n\n8.

The opponent has maintained a perfect clockwise rotation pattern for all eighteen rounds:\n   scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n3. I've now won sixteen consecutive rounds by exploiting this pattern, earning a total of 26 points from these wins.\n\n4. If the pattern continues, they would play scissors next.\n\n5. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n\n6. Looking at possible outcomes:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I lose 3 points\n   - If I play rock and they play rock: Tie, 0 points\n\n7. After eighteen rounds with the same unchanging pattern and sixteen consecutive losses, it is virtually certain the opponent will continue with their pattern.\n\n8. My counter-strategy has been perfectly effective throughout the entire game.\n\n9. The evidence for their pattern is overwhelming, making rock the clear optimal choice to counter their anticipated scissors move.\n\n10. The opponent has shown no capacity for adapting their strategy despite consistent negative outcomes.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter the anticipated scissors move based on the opponent's perfectly consistent and exploitable pattern.\n\n[move] rock\n"
