    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without any prior information about the opponent:\n   - A common first move for many players is rock (it feels \"strong\")\n   - If they play rock, paper would beat it\n   - If they play scissors, rock would beat it\n   - Paper seems slightly advantageous here\n\n5. I'll choose paper as my opening move:\n   - It beats the commonly played rock\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I learn they might be more strategic\n   - This move helps establish baseline information about opponent's style\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current streak status:\n   - Six consecutive wins!\n   - Perfect read sequence: Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors\u2192Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Paper\n   - Complete domination of recent rounds\n   - Successfully predicting their every move\n\n2. Opponent's situation:\n   - Last several moves: Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock\n   - Becoming extremely predictable\n   - Just lost with defensive rock play\n   - Shows complete psychological defeat\n\n3. Deep psychological analysis:\n   - After six straight losses, they're likely:\n     * In deepest possible tilt\n     * May have given up on strategy\n     * Could be purely emotional/reactive\n     * Might make completely random move out of desperation\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - At this level of tilt:\n     * Players might try anything\n     * Could make wildly aggressive play\n     * Might repeat previous move out of confusion\n     * Could try to be \"unpredictable\" with scissors\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Playing rock\n   - Reasoning:\n     * Protects against desperate scissors play\n     * They might try scissors to counter my paper success\n     * They've seen paper work for me repeatedly\n     * At this point, they're likely to make aggressive rather than strategic moves\n     * Even if they somehow play paper, breaking my streak now wouldn't be devastating\n\n[move] rock Expecting either a desperate scissors play or an attempt to counter my recent paper success\n"
