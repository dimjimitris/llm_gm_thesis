Since all moves are equally viable in a vacuum (each beats one option and loses to another):\n   - Rock: beats scissors, loses to paper\n   - Paper: beats rock, loses to scissors  \n   - Scissors: beats paper, loses to rock\n\n4. Without any prior information about the opponent:\n   - A common first move for many players is rock (it feels \"strong\")\n   - If they play rock, paper would beat it\n   - If they play scissors, rock would beat it\n   - Paper seems slightly advantageous here\n\n5. I'll choose paper as my opening move:\n   - It beats the commonly played rock\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I learn they might be more strategic\n   - This move helps establish baseline information about opponent's style\n\n[move] paper\n"
