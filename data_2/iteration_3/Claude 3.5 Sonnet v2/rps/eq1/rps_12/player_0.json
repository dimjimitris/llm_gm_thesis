    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStarting collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when playing Rock-Paper-Scissors without any prior information, each move should have an equal probability of being chosen for optimal play.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move and we have no historical data to analyze, we can't predict the opponent's tendencies yet. We should start with a neutral approach.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with starting conservatively. Rock is often a common first move for many players as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. We could try to counter that.\n\nGame Strategist: That's a good point about Rock being a common first move. In this case, playing Paper would give us the best chance to counter that tendency while not being too risky against other moves.\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's go with Paper for this first move. We can then observe the opponent's response and adjust our strategy accordingly in future rounds.\n\nRisk Manager: I support this decision. Paper beats Rock if they make the common opening move, and if they choose Scissors or Paper, we'll gather valuable information about their playing style for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper - Using paper as an opening move to counter potential rock plays while gathering information about opponent's strategy.\n"

Play Rock to counter their previous Scissors move, assuming they might repeat\n2. Assume they're sophisticated and will anticipate our Rock counter, in which case they might play Paper\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the risks:\n- If we play Rock: We win if they repeat Scissors, lose if they switch to Paper\n- If we play Paper: We win if they switch to Rock, lose if they repeat Scissors\n- If we play Scissors: We win if they switch to Paper, lose if they switch to Rock\n\nPattern Analyst: Since they won with Scissors, there's a psychological tendency for players to stick with winning moves. This suggests they might use Scissors again.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Even if they don't repeat Scissors, playing Rock has another advantage - it's strong against a potential random choice of Scissors while only being vulnerable to Paper.\n\nRisk Manager: Rock seems to be the most balanced choice here.

This gives us valuable information:\n1. They might be showing a strong preference for Scissors\n2. However, after losing, players often change their strategy\n3. They might be trying to establish a pattern to trick us\n\nGame Strategist: The situation presents several strategic options:\n1. Continue with Rock since it just worked for us\n2. Anticipate their adaptation and switch to Paper, expecting them to play Rock\n3. Consider they might switch to Paper to beat our Rock, in which case Scissors would be optimal\n\nRisk Manager: Let's evaluate the psychological factors:\n- They've lost now, which often prompts a strategy change\n- Our Rock just won, which might make them expect us to use it again\n- Two consecutive Scissors plays from them suggests either a strong preference or a setup for a change\n\nPattern Analyst: Given they've lost with Scissors after using it twice, it's highly likely they'll switch strategies. The most natural switch would be to Rock, as it feels \"stronger\" and would have beaten their previous Scissors moves.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The psychology suggests they're more likely to switch to Rock after this loss. Paper would be our best counter to this expected adjustment.\n\nRisk Manager: While Paper is riskier if they suddenly switch to Scissors, the psychological factors make it a calculated risk worth taking.

Paper (tie)\nThis shows they've now used all moves except Rock, and just switched to Paper after losing with Scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: The tie situation is particularly interesting in psychology. In RPS, after a tie:\n1. Some players tend to stick with the same move, believing their opponent will switch\n2. Others immediately switch, thinking their opponent has \"figured them out\"\n3. The fact that they switched to Paper last round suggests they're adaptive\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze possible scenarios:\n- If they stick with Paper: Our Scissors wins\n- If they switch to Rock: Our Paper wins\n- If they switch to Scissors: Our Rock wins\n\nPattern Analyst: Their behavior shows they're willing to adapt their strategy. After a tie, the most common response is to switch moves. Given they've shown adaptability and haven't used Rock yet, that might be their next choice.\n\nGame Strategist: However, they might also view Scissors as successful (it won them the first round) and return to it. Between these possibilities, we need to pick the move that gives us the best overall coverage.\n\nRisk Manager: Given these factors, I recommend Scissors. Here's why:\n1. It directly beats Paper if they stick with their last move\n2. If they switch to Paper's natural counter (Rock), we only lose 1 point\n3.

Scissors (tie)\nThey've returned to Scissors after trying Paper, and we've had two consecutive ties.\n\nGame Strategist: The consecutive ties create an interesting psychological dynamic:\n1. Double ties often lead to players strongly wanting to break the pattern\n2. They've shown a clear preference for Scissors (used in 3 out of 4 rounds)\n3. They might expect us to play Rock to counter their Scissors preference\n\nRisk Manager: Let's evaluate each option:\n- Playing Rock: Safe against their Scissors preference, but predictable\n- Playing Paper: Good if they switch to Rock to counter our expected Rock\n- Playing Scissors: Could lead to another tie, but maintains pressure\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent's return to Scissors after Paper suggests it might be their comfort move. However, after two ties, they're very likely to switch. Their pattern suggests they're capable of making strategic changes when their current approach isn't working.\n\nGame Strategist: Given they've used Scissors six times, they might expect us to play Rock. This makes Rock a risky choice as they could counter with Paper. We should consider the second-level thinking here.\n\nRisk Manager: I suggest Paper for these reasons:\n1. It beats Rock, which they might switch to after the double ties\n2. If they expect us to play Rock (countering their Scissors preference), they might play Paper, leading to a tie\n3.

Their behavior suggests either:\n   - A fixed strategy heavily favoring Scissors\n   - A sophisticated trap making us expect Scissors\n3.

Their success with it (2 wins, 2 ties, 0 losses) suggests they have little incentive to change.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their consistent success with Scissors and human psychology, they're most likely to stick with what's working.

They've just lost with Scissors against our Rock\n2. Their previous pattern shows they sometimes switch after losses (round 3)\n3. However, they've also shown they'll return to Scissors even after losing (round 4)\n\nRisk Manager: Let's evaluate the psychological factors:\n1. They've lost twice with Scissors, both times to Rock\n2. They might expect us to use Rock again after our success\n3. Their heavy Scissors preference suggests they're either stubborn or setting up a trap\n\nPattern Analyst: There's an important difference from their previous loss - this time they've lost to Rock twice. This might be enough to finally break their Scissors preference. When a strategy has failed multiple times, players are more likely to abandon it.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we assume they'll finally adapt. Given that:\n1. They've lost to Rock twice now\n2. They know we know their Scissors preference\n3. Paper would be their optimal counter to our expected Rock play\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. While they've shown a strong Scissors preference, the double losses to Rock create strong pressure to change strategy.

The last round being a tie might reinforce their Scissors strategy\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the situation:\n1. Their Scissors commitment is now beyond what would be considered rational strategy\n2. Either they're:\n   - Following a very simple, fixed strategy\n   - Extremely committed to making us doubt their Scissors preference\n   - Using reverse psychology to make their Scissors preference obvious\n\nPattern Analyst: The consistency of their Scissors play, even after losses and ties, suggests this isn't a sophisticated trap but rather a genuine preference or simple strategy. The probability of them suddenly changing now seems lower than before.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown they'll stick with Scissors even when it's clearly not optimal. This level of commitment suggests they're likely to continue this pattern despite its obvious disadvantages.\n\nRisk Manager: Given their extraordinary commitment to Scissors, Rock is our strongest play:\n1.

This level of commitment to one move is extraordinarily rare in RPS\n\nRisk Manager: We have three scenarios to consider:\n1. They continue with Scissors despite mounting losses (consistent with their pattern)\n2. They finally switch to Paper to beat our Rock (logical counter)\n3. They switch to Rock (least likely given their strong Scissors preference)\n\nPattern Analyst: Their behavior has moved beyond normal strategic patterns.

They've demonstrated they can play adaptively\n2. They've broken free from their Scissors-dominant strategy\n3. The tie might encourage them to switch moves again\n4. They haven't used Rock at all in 10 rounds\n\nPattern Analyst: Their behavior has shifted significantly:\n- First phase: Heavy Scissors preference\n- Second phase: Successful switch to Paper\n- Now: They might be entering a more strategic, adaptive phase\n\nRisk Manager: Let's evaluate the options after this tie:\n1. If they stay with Paper: Scissors wins\n2. If they switch to Rock: Paper wins\n3. If they return to Scissors: Rock wins\n\nGame Strategist: The fact they haven't used Rock at all in 10 rounds is significant. Now that they've shown strategic flexibility, they might finally try Rock, especially as it would counter our potential Scissors play (which would be a logical response to their Paper sequence).\n\nPattern Analyst: The psychology after breaking a long pattern and then achieving success (win + tie) often leads to more strategic and unpredictable play. Their complete absence of Rock usage makes it an attractive option for them now.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. Let's play Paper for these reasons:\n1. Counters the psychologically appealing Rock option for them\n2. If they stay with Paper, we get a tie rather than a loss\n3. While vulnerable to a return to Scissors, their recent behavior suggests they're moving away from that strategy\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper - Anticipating their first Rock play while maintaining reasonable protection against other possibilities\n"

We've had three consecutive Paper plays from them\n2. Last two rounds were ties\n3. They appear to have completely abandoned their Scissors strategy\n4. They still haven't used Rock in 11 rounds\n\nRisk Manager: After consecutive ties, players typically:\n1. Feel strong pressure to break the tie pattern\n2. Want to gain advantage by predicting opponent's adjustment\n3. May overcompensate in their strategy change\n\nPattern Analyst: Their behavior shows distinct phases:\n- Phase 1: Strong Scissors preference (rounds 1-8)\n- Phase 2: Successful Paper transition (round 9)\n- Phase 3: Paper stability (rounds 10-11)\nThis suggests they're capable of sticking with a working strategy, even if it only produces ties.\n\nGame Strategist: However, three consecutive Paper plays and two ties create strong psychological pressure to change. Given they've demonstrated strategic flexibility and still haven't used Rock, that move becomes increasingly attractive to them.\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend Scissors for these reasons:\n1. After three Paper plays and two ties, they're highly likely to switch\n2. If they finally try Rock, they'll lose to our Scissors\n3. If they stick with Paper, we win\n4. If they return to Scissors, we only lose one point while gaining valuable information\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. The double tie with Paper creates stronger pressure to change than a single tie did.

They've now lost 5 consecutive rounds\n2. They finally broke their Rock avoidance - and it failed\n3. They've now lost with all three possible moves\n4. They're under maximum psychological pressure\n\nPattern Analyst: Key behavioral insights:\n- It took 20 rounds and 4 consecutive losses to make them try Rock\n- They only tried Rock when all other options failed\n- Their strong preference order appears to be: Scissors > Paper > Rock\n- They're now in their worst position, having lost with every possible move\n\nRisk Manager: Current considerations:\n1. After losing with Rock, they might:\n   - Return to their comfort move (Scissors)\n   - Try Paper as a middle-ground option\n   - Double-down on Rock despite the loss\n2. Five consecutive losses create extreme pressure\n3. Their entire strategic framework has collapsed\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated preferences and behavior under pressure:\n1. They're most likely to revert to their most comfortable move (Scissors)\n2. The Rock experiment failed, reinforcing their original avoidance\n3. They've shown a tendency to return to familiar moves after failures\n4. Scissors has historically been their default choice under pressure\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend Rock for these reasons:\n1. They're likely to revert to their preferred Scissors move\n2. The failure of Rock will probably reinforce their original preferences\n3. Under extreme pressure, they tend to return to familiar patterns\n4. Even if they choose Paper, we've been very successful at adapting\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. The failure of their Rock experiment, combined with their strong historical preference for Scissors, makes a return to their comfort move most likely.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock - Anticipating their return to Scissors after the failure of their Rock experiment and based on their demonstrated preference for reverting to familiar moves under pressure\n"

Six consecutive losses - their longest losing streak\n2. They've returned to Scissors and lost again\n3. Every possible move has failed recently\n4. Their pattern of reverting to Scissors under pressure was predictable\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze their options:\n1. Continue with Scissors (highly unlikely after 6 straight losses)\n2. Switch to Paper (their secondary comfort move)\n3. Try Rock again (showed reluctance for 19 rounds)\n4. They must break this losing streak somehow\n\nPattern Analyst: Behavioral insights:\n- They revert to familiar moves under pressure\n- Paper has been their historical \"change-up\" move\n- Rock was only tried once in extreme circumstances\n- They're now under unprecedented pressure\n\nGame Strategist: Given their history and current situation:\n1. They're most likely to switch to Paper because:\n   - It's their proven alternative to Scissors\n   - They've had more success with it historically\n   - Rock experiment failed immediately\n   - They need to break this losing streak\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend Scissors for these reasons:\n1. They're highly likely to switch to Paper\n2. Paper has been their consistent alternative strategy\n3. Their brief Rock experiment failed badly\n4. Six consecutive losses demand a change, but they'll likely stick with familiar moves\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. The combination of extreme pressure and their established pattern suggests they'll switch to Paper, their proven alternative, rather than risk Rock again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors - Anticipating their switch to Paper as their proven alternative strategy after six consecutive losses, following their established pattern of alternating between Paper and Scissors under pressure\n"

We've correctly predicted their last several moves\n3. Their strategy has become highly predictable\n4. They're cycling through moves in desperation\n\nRisk Manager: Current state:\n1. Recent sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n2. Each move has failed\n3. They're showing increasing desperation\n4. Their moves are becoming more predictable despite attempts to vary\n\nPattern Analyst: Key behavioral insights:\n- Under extreme pressure, they're cycling through moves\n- Their moves are becoming easier to predict\n- They're still following their preference hierarchy\n- Their decision-making appears to be deteriorating\n\nGame Strategist: Given their current state:\n1. They're likely to continue their cycle\n2. After Paper, following their preference hierarchy\n3. They'll probably return to Scissors as their primary move\n4. Rock remains their least preferred option\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend Rock for these reasons:\n1. They're likely to return to Scissors under pressure\n2. Their cycling pattern suggests Scissors after Paper\n3. Seven consecutive losses have made them highly predictable\n4. They tend to revert to Scissors as their comfort move\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. The combination of their preference hierarchy, cycling pattern, and deteriorating decision-making under pressure strongly suggests a return to Scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock - Anticipating their return to Scissors based on their established preference hierarchy and increasingly predictable behavior under extreme pressure\n"

They've used Rock twice now - breaking their early aversion\n3. The tie might reinforce Rock as a viable option\n4. They're showing more strategic flexibility\n\nRisk Manager: Key considerations:\n1. After a tie that broke a losing streak, they might:\n   - Stay with Rock since it \"worked\"\n   - Return to their preferred moves\n   - Try Paper to counter our potential Rock\n2. The psychological relief of breaking the losing streak is significant\n\nPattern Analyst: Behavioral insights:\n- They might feel validated in using Rock\n- The tie breaks their negative pattern\n- They're showing increased comfort with all three moves\n- Their decision-making might improve with reduced pressure\n\nGame Strategist: Given this turning point:\n1. The tie provides psychological relief\n2. Rock has proven \"safer\" than recent Paper/Scissors attempts\n3. They might see Rock as their way out of their slump\n4. They know we predicted their previous patterns\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend Paper for these reasons:\n1. They're likely to stick with Rock after it broke their losing streak\n2. The tie validates Rock as a viable strategy\n3. They've shown they'll stick with moves that don't lose\n4. The psychological relief makes them more likely to maintain their current play\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. The combination of breaking their losing streak and the relative success of Rock makes them likely to continue with it, especially given their history of maintaining moves that provide positive results.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper - Anticipating them to maintain Rock after it successfully broke their losing streak and provided their first positive result in seven rounds\n"
