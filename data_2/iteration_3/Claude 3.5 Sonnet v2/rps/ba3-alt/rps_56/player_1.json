    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I need to analyze the point system:\n   * Rock vs Paper: +3/-3 points\n   * Paper vs Scissors: +1/-1 points \n   * Scissors vs Rock: +1/-1 points\n\n2. Since it's the first move:\n   * I have no prior information about the opponent's strategy\n   * Rock-Paper-Scissors is typically balanced\n   * However, the point system here is unbalanced\n\n3. Analyzing the risk/reward:\n   * Rock has highest potential gain (3 points) if opponent plays paper\n   * Rock also has low potential loss (-1) if opponent plays scissors\n   * This makes rock a relatively safe yet potentially rewarding choice\n\n4. Additional considerations:\n   * Many players tend to choose rock as their first move\n   * If opponent plays rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n   * If they play paper, I lose 3 points\n   * If they play scissors, I win 1 point\n\n5. Final reasoning:\n   * Given the unbalanced point system\n   * And the relatively safe risk/reward ratio\n   * Rock appears to be a reasonable first move\n\n[move] rock\n"

Recent sequence:\n   * Round 20: scissors tie (0)\n   * Round 21: I paper, they scissors (+1)\n   * Round 22: paper tie (0)\n   * Round 23: I scissors, they paper (-1)\n   * Total: -1 points\n   * Lost newly achieved tie\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   * They're showing strong adaptability\n   * Beat my scissors with unexpected paper\n   * Didn't follow conventional post-tie strategy\n   * They regained lead with surprising move\n   * Game remains extremely close\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * They've regained small lead\n   * Showed clever counter-prediction\n   * Might be confident after successful trap\n   * Could try similar misdirection\n   * I need to avoid being predictable\n\n4. Their potential strategies:\n   * Just succeeded with paper\n   * Might stick with winning move\n   * Could expect me to play rock to counter paper\n   * Or expect scissors to counter expected rock\n   * They're thinking multiple moves ahead\n\n5. Final reasoning:\n   * They showed willingness to use paper aggressively\n   * Paper is high-risk move in this situation\n   * They might try it again after success\n   * If they expect rock counter, they'll use paper\n   * If they expect scissors counter, they'll use rock\n   * Rock provides best balance:\n     * Beats scissors if they try to counter paper\n     * Beats expected scissors if they think I'll counter their paper\n     * Only loses 3 to paper, but worth risk\n   * Need strong move to regain tie\n\n[move] rock\n"
