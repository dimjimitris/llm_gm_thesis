Considering opponent psychology:\n- After a tie, players often change their move\n- If they believe I might stick to rock, they might switch to paper\n\n3. Looking at my options:\n- If I stay with rock and they switch to paper, I lose 3 points\n- If I switch to paper and they switch to scissors, I lose 1 point\n- If I switch to scissors and they stick to rock, I lose 1 point\n\n4. Strategic consideration:\n- Paper would beat rock if they stick to it\n- Paper has the highest potential gain (3 points)\n- Given that many players change moves after a tie, and rock was just played, paper seems like a calculated risk\n\n5.

Strategic decision:\n- After success with scissors, they often switch moves\n- They might expect me to use paper to counter their scissors\n- Rock has been punished, making it less likely they'll expect it again\n- They've historically favored rock as a safe move after wins\n\n[move] paper - Anticipating a return to rock while accepting calculated risk against potential scissors continuation\n"
