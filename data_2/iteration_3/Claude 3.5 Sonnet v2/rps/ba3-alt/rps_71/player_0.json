    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Recent game pattern:\n   * Last five rounds:\n     - Round 20: Scissors vs Paper (lost -1)\n     - Round 21: Rock vs Paper (won +3)\n     - Round 22: Rock vs Scissors (lost -1)\n     - Round 23: Rock vs Scissors (lost -1)\n   * We've lost twice in a row with Rock\n   * Opponent beat us with Scissors twice in a row\n   * Our strategy has become predictable\n\n2. Opponent's recent success:\n   * Two consecutive wins with Scissors\n   * They've countered our Rock strategy\n   * They're showing confidence\n   * They're successfully reading our defensive play\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   * After two successful Scissors plays:\n     - They might stick with winning move\n     - They might expect us to counter with Paper\n     - They might switch expecting us to switch\n   * We're in a vulnerable position\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   * Sticking with Rock has failed twice\n   * They might triple down on Scissors\n   * Or switch to Paper expecting our Rock\n   * Need to break our own predictable pattern\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * Must abandon Rock after two losses\n   * They might expect Paper from us to counter Rock\n   * Triple Scissors from them would be bold\n   * Paper gives us best chance:\n     - Beats Rock if they switch to defensive\n     - Only loses 1 point to Scissors if wrong\n     - Has highest potential reward\n\n[move] paper (Breaking our Rock pattern, accepting Scissors risk for higher Paper reward potential)\n"
