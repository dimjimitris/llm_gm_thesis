    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In this game's rules (where scissors beats rock), I need to break this negative pattern:\n\n[move] paper This should work well because:\n1. If they stick with scissors after their success, my paper wins\n2. If they switch to rock thinking I'll try paper to counter scissors, my paper still wins\n3. If they play paper, it's a tie\n\nPaper gives me the best coverage against their likely moves and could help break their momentum.\n"

Stay with paper expecting me to switch to scissors (my rock wins)\n2. Switch to rock themselves expecting me to stay with paper (tie)\n3. Switch to scissors expecting me to use rock (they would win)\n\nI'll go with rock here - while it's vulnerable to scissors, it feels like they might stick with paper or mirror my expected move after the tie.\n"

Switch to paper to beat an expected rock (my scissors ties)\n3.
