Recent sequence analysis:\n   * Last three moves: rock(loss) \u2192 rock(tie) \u2192 ?\n   * I've played rock three times in a row\n   * This creates a very strong pattern\n\n3. Pattern vulnerability:\n   * Three consecutive rocks makes my strategy obvious\n   * Opponent has shown they can exploit patterns\n   * They would be foolish not to expect another rock\n\n4. Opponent's perspective:\n   * They know I've played rock three times\n   * They might expect me to finally break this pattern\n   * Or they might think I'm stubborn enough to continue\n\n5. Psychology after tie:\n   * Ties often prompt changes in strategy\n   * But opponent might expect this and counter it\n   * Multiple levels of thinking are at play\n\n6. Strategic options:\n   * Continue rock: Very predictable, likely to lose\n   * Switch to paper: Obvious counter to rock, might be expected\n   * Switch to scissors: Less obvious choice\n\n7. Final reasoning:\n   * Three rocks in a row is too predictable\n   * Opponent likely expects either:\n     - Another rock (from stubbornness)\n     - Or paper (to beat their rock)\n   * Therefore, they're most likely to play paper\n   * Scissors would beat their paper\n   * Even if they play rock, scissors only loses one point\n   * Breaking the rock pattern is crucial\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Complete game history review:\n   * Most recent sequence:\n     * R20: rock (tie) vs rock\n     * R21: paper (tie) vs paper\n     * R22: rock (loss) vs scissors\n   * Current score: -1 points\n\n2. Analysis of last round:\n   * My rock play was countered by scissors\n   * I tried to anticipate their counter to paper\n   * They outthought my prediction\n   * They broke the tie pattern effectively\n\n3. Pattern observation:\n   * Recent sequence shows:\n     - Two ties followed by their win\n     - They're getting better at breaking patterns\n     - They're successfully predicting my defensive plays\n     - They're making aggressive moves when I play conservative\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   * I'm back to negative points\n   * They have momentum\n   * They might expect me to:\n     - Play more aggressively to recover\n     - Or become more conservative after loss\n     - Try to counter their scissors\n\n5. Opponent's recent success:\n   * They won with an aggressive scissors play\n   * They've shown ability to:\n     - Break tie patterns\n     - Counter defensive moves\n     - Think ahead of my strategy\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   * Need to recover point\n   * Can't be too predictable\n   * Must avoid being too reactive\n\n7. Final reasoning:\n   * After winning with scissors:\n     - They might stick with aggressive play\n     - They might expect paper from me to beat their rock\n     - They might expect me to play rock again out of caution\n   * Given their success with aggressive plays\n   * And their ability to read defensive moves\n   * Paper would:\n     - Beat rock if they play conservative\n     - Tie with paper if they try to reset\n     - Lose to scissors if they stay aggressive\n   * Need to take calculated risk\n   * Playing defensively hasn't worked\n   * Time to make aggressive move myself\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Last round analysis:\n   * My aggressive scissors play succeeded\n   * Opponent played rock, possibly:\n     - Expecting me to play paper\n     - Playing defensively after their win\n     - Trying to counter expected paper\n\n3. Pattern dynamics:\n   * Recent rounds highly unpredictable\n   * Both players making unexpected moves\n   * Traditional patterns aren't holding\n   * Success coming from counter-intuitive plays\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   * Both players showing ability to recover\n   * Score back at neutral\n   * Opponent just lost when playing conservatively\n   * They might abandon defensive play\n\n5. Opponent's possible thoughts:\n   * They lost to unexpected scissors\n   * They might expect me to:\n     - Stay aggressive after success\n     - Switch to paper thinking they'll use rock again\n     - Play rock anticipating their scissors\n\n6. Strategic depth:\n   * If they expect scissors again, they'll play rock\n   * If they think I'll switch to paper, they'll play scissors\n   * If they think I'll predict above, they might play paper\n\n7. Final reasoning:\n   * After losing to scissors:\n     - They're unlikely to play rock again\n     - They might expect me to repeat scissors\n     - They're likely to play more aggressively\n   * Given their sophisticated adaptation:\n     - They probably won't make obvious moves\n     - They might try to get ahead of my thinking\n     - They'll likely avoid being predictable\n   * Paper would:\n     - Beat rock if they play defensive\n     - Tie with paper if they try to reset\n     - Lose to scissors if they get aggressive\n   * Paper provides balanced risk/reward\n   * Time to switch from aggressive to calculating\n\n[move] paper\n"
