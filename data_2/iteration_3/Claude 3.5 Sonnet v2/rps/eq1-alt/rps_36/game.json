My opponent isn't using exactly the same decision process as I am\n2. They might have been deliberately matching moves and chose this moment to break pattern\n3. The deterministic nature I assumed might not be as absolute as I thought\n\nThis new information requires a strategic adjustment. If my opponent:\n- Just broke the pattern with scissors\n- Might be employing a more sophisticated strategy than simple mirroring\n- Could be trying to establish a false pattern before breaking it\n\n[move] rock\n\nI choose rock because:\n1. It would win against their last move (scissors)\n2. Now that the pattern is broken, we're back to more traditional game theory\n3. If they were setting up this break in pattern, they might expect me to choose scissors to counter their scissors\n"
