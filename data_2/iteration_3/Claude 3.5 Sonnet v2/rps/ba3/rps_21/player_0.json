    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Probability Expert - For calculating expected values and odds\n3. Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior\n4. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when beating rock, while having relatively low risk (-1 points) if countered by scissors. Rock and scissors only give 1 point for winning but rock risks -3 points against paper.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. Paper seems to have the best risk-reward ratio. The worst case with paper is losing 1 point, while potentially gaining 3 points. Both rock and scissors have worse risk-reward ratios.\n\nProbability Expert: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy. In such cases, it's best to choose the option with the best expected value considering uniform random opponent moves.\n\nPattern Analyzer: With no historical data to analyze, I agree with focusing on the mathematical expectation. Paper seems to be the most logical choice for an opening move.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's calculate expected values:\nPaper: (+3 vs rock, 0 vs paper, -1 vs scissors) = +0.67 average\nRock: (+1 vs scissors, 0 vs rock, -3 vs paper) = -0.67 average\nScissors: (+1 vs paper, 0 vs scissors, -1 vs rock) = 0 average\n\nRisk Manager: Based on these calculations, paper has the highest expected value and manageable downside risk. I recommend choosing paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Playing paper as it offers the best combination of potential reward (3 points) and limited risk (-1 points), with the highest expected value against a random opponent.\n"

They also analyzed the game similarly and reached the same conclusion about paper's optimal risk-reward ratio\n2. They might be a strategic player rather than a random player\n3. They might stick with paper since it was a \"safe\" first move\n\nGame Strategist: Given this information, we need to consider what a rational opponent might do in the second round:\n- They might expect us to switch to scissors to counter their paper\n- They might switch to rock to counter our potential scissors\n- They might stick with paper assuming we'll overthink and not choose scissors\n\nProbability Expert: If they're a strategic player, the most common psychological pattern would be to switch after a tie. However, they might also anticipate this and double-bluff by keeping paper.\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at our options:\n1. Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n2. Paper: Ties with paper (0), loses to scissors (-1), beats rock (+3)\n3. Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've shown strategic thinking by choosing paper first, I think they're likely to expect us to choose scissors to counter their paper. Therefore, they might switch to rock to counter our anticipated scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: If we believe they'll switch to rock, then paper would be our best move, giving us +3 points. The risk is acceptable since if we're wrong and they choose scissors, we only lose 1 point.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. The opponent has demonstrated strategic thinking, and the most logical counter to an anticipated scissors play would be rock. Let's exploit that with paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on the opponent's demonstrated strategic thinking and the game theory analysis, playing paper to counter an anticipated rock move while maintaining acceptable risk.\n"

They might be following a fixed strategy of always playing paper\n2. They're trying to establish a pattern to trap us\n3. They're extremely risk-averse and sticking to paper's balanced risk-reward profile\n\nGame Strategist: Two consecutive paper plays strongly suggests they're either:\na) Very conservative in their strategy\nb) Setting us up to expect paper again, hoping we'll finally switch to scissors so they can counter with rock\n\nProbability Expert: The likelihood of randomly choosing paper three times in a row is relatively low (1/27). This suggests their moves are deliberate rather than random.\n\nRisk Manager: We have three options to consider:\n1. Play scissors: If they play paper again, we win +1 point. If they've been setting us up and play rock, we lose -1 point\n2. Play paper again: Guarantees no loss if they play paper, but misses opportunity to gain points\n3. Play rock: Very risky as we'd lose 3 points to their paper if they maintain their strategy\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, we should exploit their apparent pattern. The principle of maximal exploitation suggests we should counter their consistent paper plays with scissors. Even if this is a trap and they switch to rock, our downside is only -1 point, while our upside is +1 point.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. Three paper plays in a row would be extremely conservative or naive. Even if they're setting a trap, the risk-reward ratio of playing scissors here is favorable: equal upside and downside (+1/-1), but we're playing against a pattern that's becoming too consistent to ignore.\n\nRisk Manager: The potential loss of 1 point with scissors is acceptable given the strong pattern we've observed. The opportunity cost of playing it safe with another paper play is becoming too high.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After observing two consecutive paper plays, we're switching to scissors to exploit this pattern.

They've played scissors in positions 4, 6, and 9\n2. They just lost with scissors against our rock\n3. Their losses have both come from aggressive moves (scissors) against our rock\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown they:\n1. Don't like to lose twice in a row (changed strategy after previous losses)\n2. Use sophisticated multi-move strategies\n3. Are willing to take calculated risks but avoid consecutive aggressive plays\n\nProbability Expert: After losing with scissors, based on their previous behavior, they're highly likely to switch strategies. They've shown a tendency to:\n1. Adapt after losses\n2. Avoid repeating moves that just lost\n3. Mix defensive and offensive plays\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze their likely responses:\n1. Paper - High reward (+3) but aggressive move after a loss\n2. Rock - Safe, defensive move that ties against rock\n3. Scissors - Unlikely as it just lost and they avoid repetition after losses\n\nGame Strategist: Their most logical play here is rock because:\n1. It's a safe, defensive move after a loss\n2. It protects against us continuing with rock\n3. It matches their demonstrated pattern of playing conservatively after losses\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. Their historical behavior suggests they prefer to stabilize their position after a loss rather than make aggressive plays. Rock would be their safest option.\n\nRisk Manager: If we believe they'll play rock, paper is our optimal move because:\n1. Wins significantly against their expected rock (+3)\n2. Only risks -1 if they play scissors\n3. Ties if they make an unexpected paper play\n\nProbability Expert: The expected value of paper is highest here given their probable rock play and their demonstrated tendency to avoid repeated losing moves (scissors).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Playing paper as we expect the opponent to choose rock as a safe, defensive move after their scissors loss. This offers us high scoring potential while maintaining acceptable risk, and aligns with their demonstrated patterns of conservative play after losses.\n"

This is their first experience of losing by 3 points\n\nGame Strategist: This is a critical moment because:\n1. They've experienced their biggest loss\n2. They're on a two-round losing streak\n3. We've demonstrated we can read their strategy\n\nProbability Expert: After a major loss (-3), players typically either:\n1. Become very aggressive to try to win back points\n2. Become extremely cautious to avoid further big losses\n3. Try to mirror the winning player's strategy\n\nRisk Manager: Given their sophisticated play style shown throughout the game, they're most likely to:\n1. Avoid paper (too risky after just losing big with rock)\n2. Avoid rock (just lost heavily with it)\n3. Consider scissors as it counters our winning paper play\n\nGame Strategist: I strongly believe they'll play scissors here because:\n1. It directly counters our successful paper play\n2. It's a measured response (-1/+1 payoff structure)\n3. It's consistent with their demonstrated strategic thinking\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Their history shows they adapt quickly to losses and don't repeat losing moves. Scissors would be their most logical counter to our paper success.\n\nRisk Manager: If we expect scissors, rock is our best play because:\n1. Wins against their expected scissors (+1)\n2. Only vulnerable to paper (-3), which would be extremely aggressive after their big loss\n3.

Break established patterns dramatically\n2. Make bold plays to recover points\n3. Might finally resort to their highest reward option (paper)\n\nRisk Manager: Given their sophisticated play style but difficult position:\n1. Paper becomes very attractive as it:\n   - Offers highest potential gain (+3)\n   - Breaks their recent scissors-rock pattern\n   - Could catch us expecting scissors again\n2.

Their strategic sophistication combined with their current losing position makes paper their most logical play. It breaks patterns and offers maximum recovery potential.\n\nRisk Manager: If we expect paper, scissors is our best response:\n1. Wins against their expected paper play (+1)\n2.

Paper (their original strategy) just failed again\n3. They've experienced the longest possible losing streak\n4. No move has worked in any context\n\nProbability Expert: After ten straight losses including recent paper failure:\n1. Random play becomes highly likely\n2. Strategic thinking is likely completely abandoned\n3. Basic defensive instincts may dominate\n\nRisk Manager: In this extreme situation:\n1. Rock becomes their most likely play because:\n   - Most defensive option\n   - Counters our successful scissors\n   - Psychologically safest choice\n   - Natural response to protect against further losses\n2. Paper just failed them again\n3. Scissors would be too aggressive\n\nGame Strategist: I strongly believe they will play rock because:\n1. It's the most natural defensive response\n2. Counters our successful scissors play\n3. Offers psychological comfort in extreme distress\n4. Most basic and instinctive choice under pressure\n\nPattern Analyzer: When all strategy fails, players often default to rock as it feels most defensive and protective. Their position suggests they'll seek psychological safety over strategic advantage.\n\nRisk Manager: If we expect rock, paper is our optimal play:\n1. Wins significantly against their expected rock (+3)\n2. They're unlikely to play scissors given their state\n3. They've shown a tendency toward defensive plays under pressure\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Playing paper as we expect the opponent, after ten consecutive losses and complete strategic breakdown, to resort to rock as their most defensive and psychologically safe option. In situations of total strategic collapse, players often default to rock as a protective measure, especially after losing with more aggressive moves.\n"
