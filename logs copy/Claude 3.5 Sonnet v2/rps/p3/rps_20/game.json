They might be playing somewhat predictably now. If they continue this pattern, they might switch back to rock.

Psychological momentum:\n   - Opponent just lost after a strong winning streak\n   - They might be more cautious now\n   - They're likely to adjust their strategy after loss\n   - They might expect me to stay with winning scissors\n\n3. Typical responses after losing:\n   - Players often counter the move that beat them\n   - They might play rock to beat expected scissors\n   - Or they might expect this thinking and play paper\n   - Some might stick to paper hoping for opponent overconfidence\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Staying with scissors is predictable and risky\n   - Playing paper is risky if they choose rock\n   - Rock is safest against expected rock (tie) and beats scissors\n\n5. Decision: I'll play rock because:\n   - Beats scissors if they try to counter my expected paper\n   - Ties with rock if they try to counter my last scissors\n   - Even if they predict this and play paper, the -3 loss is worth risking given my current need to play more assertively\n\n[move] rock\n"
