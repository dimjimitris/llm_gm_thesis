    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding opponent psychology and predicting behavior\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential payoffs and penalties\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors only give 1 point. However, paper also risks the highest penalty if the opponent plays scissors (-1).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they might tend to choose rock as their first move - it's a common opening choice as it feels \"strong\" and \"safe\" to many players.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that we're starting fresh and paper has the highest potential payoff (3 points), while only risking a -1 penalty if we lose, the risk-reward ratio favors playing paper. Even if we lose, the penalty is minimal.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper is optimal here - it can win big (3 points) and lose small (-1 point). Against a fresh player who's likely to play rock, this is our best option.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Concur with this analysis. First-time players often default to rock, making paper a strong counter-choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Playing paper as it offers the best risk-reward ratio and is effective against the common opening move of rock.\n"

This tells us they're either thinking similarly to us or they also recognize paper's favorable risk-reward ratio.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie, players often try to outsmart their opponent by predicting what they think the other player will do. Since we both played paper, they might expect us to switch to scissors to beat their paper, and thus they might switch to rock to counter our predicted scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the scenarios:\n1. If we play paper again: 0 points if tie, -1 if they play scissors, +3 if they play rock\n2. If we play scissors: +1 if they play paper, -1 if they play rock, 0 if tie\n3. If we play rock: +1 if they play scissors, -3 if they play paper, 0 if tie\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological tendency after a tie is to change moves. Our opponent is likely to switch. Given they demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing paper first, they might try to counter our predicted move.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing rock. Here's why:\n1. It protects against the likely scissors play (if opponent tries to beat our previous paper)\n2. While it's vulnerable to paper, we've seen our opponent is willing to switch strategies\n3. It breaks the pattern of our previous move, making us less predictable\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. Rock provides a good balance of risk and reward in this situation, and protects against the most psychologically likely move from our opponent (scissors).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Playing rock as it counters the likely scissors play our opponent might make to beat our previous paper move.\n"

This suggests either they're thinking very similarly to us or they might be deliberately copying our moves.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Two consecutive ties creates an interesting psychological dynamic. The pattern recognition part of human decision-making becomes very active here. Our opponent might be:\n1. Trying to break the mirroring pattern\n2. Anticipating that we'll try to break the pattern\n3. Continuing the mirroring strategy, but one move behind (so they might play rock again)\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at our history:\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: Both rock (tie)\nThe fact that there's been no point scoring yet might make both players more aggressive in seeking a win.\n\nGame Strategist: Given paper has the highest potential payoff (3 points), and our opponent has shown a tendency to mirror our moves, this might be a good time to use this to our advantage. If they're playing one move behind, they might stick with rock, making paper particularly effective.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper is indeed optimal here:\n- If they play rock (continuing the last pattern): we win 3 points\n- If they play paper (mirroring): we tie (0 points)\n- If they play scissors (trying to break pattern): we lose 1 point\nThe risk-reward ratio favors paper, as the potential gain (3) outweighs the potential loss (-1).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological pressure to break the tie pattern is strong now.

They might abandon prediction-based strategy and either:\na) Play completely randomly to break any patterns\nb) Go for the highest potential payoff move (paper) out of desperation\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: When players are down significantly, they often switch to high-risk, high-reward strategies.
