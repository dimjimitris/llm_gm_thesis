    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, let's analyze the payoff structure:\n- Paper has highest potential gain (3 points) when winning against rock\n- Rock and scissors have lower gain (1 point each) when winning\n- Paper has lowest loss (-1 point) when losing to scissors\n- Rock has highest loss (-3 points) when losing to paper\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the asymmetric payoff structure, paper appears to have the best risk-reward ratio:\n- Win: +3 points vs rock\n- Loss: -1 point vs scissors\n- Tie: 0 points vs paper\nThis makes paper an attractive first move against a fresh opponent.\n\nPattern Observer: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to analyze. However, research shows that rock is often the most common opening move among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nDecision Maker: Based on the analysis:\n1. Paper has the best payoff structure\n2. Rock is statistically common as an opening move\n3. Paper would counter the most likely opening move\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move against a fresh opponent, I choose paper as it offers the best risk-reward ratio and counters the statistically common opening move of rock.\n"

Stay with rock hoping we'll change our strategy\nThe riskier move for them would be to choose paper, as it would only make sense if they expect us to choose rock.\n\nPattern Observer: After a significant loss, players often switch to what would have beaten their opponent's last move.

The game has shown high-level mind games where both players are trying to predict and counter each other's strategies.\n\nRisk Analyst: Current situation analysis:\n1. Opponent has now lost with paper twice\n2. They've shown a tendency to repeat moves (paper twice)\n3. After losing to scissors, the most common responses are:\n   - Rock (to beat the scissors that just beat them)\n   - Scissors (breaking the pattern completely)\n4.

The opponent might expect us to switch to scissors to beat the paper from the tie\n3. The tie has created a neutral psychological state - neither player has momentum\n\nPattern Observer: Notable patterns:\n1. The opponent has now used paper four times (most frequent choice)\n2.

The opponent has used paper in five out of six rounds, with mixed but overall positive results\n2. They've shown unusual commitment to paper despite its high-risk nature\n3. This could be either:\n   - A strong psychological commitment to paper\n   - A setup for a major strategy switch\n4. At this point, their paper strategy has become almost predictable, which makes it suspicious\n\nPattern Observer: Crucial patterns:\n1. Five paper plays from opponent: lost twice, won twice, tied once\n2. They've stuck with paper even when it seemed irrational\n3.

The situation has become psychologically complex - are they truly this predictable, or are we being manipulated?\n\nPattern Observer: Key observations:\n1.

This confirms they were indeed setting up an elaborate trap, waiting for either us to switch to scissors (which we didn't) or for the perfect moment to strike.\n\nRisk Analyst: New situation assessment:\n1. The opponent has proven extremely patient and strategic\n2. They were willing to play multiple ties to set up a small win\n3. After such a dramatic pattern break, they're likely expecting:\n   - Us to switch to rock to counter their scissors\n   - Us to return to paper out of stubbornness\n4. Their previous patience suggests they're thinking multiple moves ahead\n\nPattern Observer: Critical patterns:\n1. They broke their paper pattern at a psychologically significant moment\n2. They chose the minimal-gain move (scissors for +1) rather than trying for a larger win\n3. After such a calculated break, they're likely to have their next move already planned\n4. Their demonstrated patience suggests they're not playing for quick gains\n\nDecision Maker: Considering:\n1. The opponent has shown exceptional strategic depth\n2. They're willing to play the long game\n3. They likely have a specific expectation for our response to their pattern break\n4. We need to respect their demonstrated skill while not becoming too predictable\n\n[move] scissors I choose scissors because:\n- They might return to paper, thinking we'll choose rock to counter their previous scissors\n- If they choose paper (returning to their long-running strategy), we win +1\n- If they choose rock (expecting our rock), we lose only -1\n- If they stick with scissors, we tie\n- This play acknowledges their strategic sophistication while avoiding the obvious counter-move (rock) that they might be expecting\n"
