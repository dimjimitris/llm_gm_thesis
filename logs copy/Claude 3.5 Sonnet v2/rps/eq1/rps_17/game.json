Since this is the first round:\n   - There's no pattern to exploit\n   - The opponent is likely to make a common opening move\n   - Rock is often a popular first move choice for many players\n   - Paper would counter rock effectively\n\n4.

Considering probabilities:\n   - If they expect rock from me, they'll likely play paper\n   - If they're truly scissors-biased, they might play scissors again\n   - Playing scissors would beat paper if they switch\n   - Playing rock would beat scissors if they don't switch\n\n5.

Current situation:\n   - Four ties total in the game (3 rock, 1 paper)\n   - The paper-paper tie breaks previous patterns\n   - Both players showing increased strategic caution\n   - Game has evolved from early aggressive plays to more strategic matching\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   - Consecutive ties might make them feel they're \"reading\" me better\n   - They might be gaining confidence in predicting my moves\n   - They might think they've found a successful strategy in matching\n   - The game has become more about breaking the mirroring pattern\n\n4. Pattern breaking analysis:\n   - After double ties, something has to give\n   - They might expect another matching attempt\n   - They might try to predict and counter my next move\n   - Breaking pattern needs to be unexpected\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - They might expect paper again, continuing the match\n   - Or they might expect me to switch to scissors to beat paper\n   - Rock would:\n     * Be unexpected after paper-paper tie\n     * Beat scissors if they try to counter expected paper\n     * Break the matching pattern\n     * Force them out of their comfort zone of matching\n     * Be safe against most counter-strategies\n\n[move] rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
