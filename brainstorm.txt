Let's find the games we should play:

We agreed that we should explore probabilistic games, but in a more complex environment.
In our previous experiment regarding probabilistic games we tested Rock-Paper-Scissors,
where players play only one round against an unknown adversary. We should have players
play multiple games and integrate some kind of learning-from-experience technique into
the experiment.

We discussed games where the optimal strategy of the single-round variant is obvious/easy
to discern.

Let's find the games that we should play:

2. Matching-Pennies Game        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_pennies)
3. Ring-Network Game            (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05488)
4. Driving or Stoplight Game    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_game)
5. Escalation Game              (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67qDMfQoGMw)
6. Hawk-Dove Game               (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game))
7. Prisoner's Dilemma           (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma)
8. Stag Hunt                    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt)
