message types should be named:

Let's find the games we should play:

We agreed that we should explore probabilistic games, but in a more complex environment.

Now, let's find the games that we should play:
1. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
2. Matching Pennies Game
3. Driving Game
4. Stoplight Game
5. Escalation Game
